I agree as to the original deliverables.  However, for the GE Turbine
Contract, an officer of the LLC who is named on the Secretary's certificate
(i.e., Duran, Calger or Thomas) should sign.  Just to be safe, we may also
want the M/D of the LLC who is named on the Secretary's certificate (i.e.,
Duran) to sign the LLC membership certificates. =20

Will you be sending the originals to me to forward to Freshfields and Paul

Here's what I have on my list as original deliverables

GE turbine contract - any officer of LLC
Amended LLC- any officer of ENA
Membership certificates - signed by MD of LLC, which isn't Jake

The only things I have which MUST be signed by Jake are the written
consents of the LLC, which aren't on the original deliverable list.  These
will be ready first thing Wednesday am.

I'm sorry,  I don't recall you telling me that the original membership
certificates had to be in New York on Wednesday. However, we will be able
to handle this.

This pre-closing drill is why I asked for a definitive, signed off  closing
list by mid-day Friday.

Thanks,

Kay

It won't be a big deal if we can get these documents into Federal Express
Tuesday night for delivery Wednesday as indicated below.  If there is a
chance that Jake will be late so as to miss the Fed Ex deadline, then we
need to make alternative arrangements for signature.  Otherwise Paul
Hastings will be forced to renegotiate its legal opinion with Freshfields,
and we owe them the courtesy of letting them know this first thing Tuesday
morning, as I indicated to them as early as Thursday of last week that we
had no objection to getting at least the original membership certificate to
them by overnight delivery prior to closing to hold in escrow until the
closing, in order to satisfy opinion issues associated with perfection of
the lien on the membership interest.  Please let me know.  Thanks.

As soon as I get back to the office, I will re-check the Salmon resolutions
electing officers to confirm Chris Calger's title with Salmon and will let
you know.

I think we will be able to get the documents you listed signed tomorrow,
but Jake won't be here before 7pm, so anything he is signing won't be ready
until Wednesday am.  It seems to me that this isn't a big deal, but I would

I need the address of where to send the membership certificate.  There is
not enough time for the document to pass back through Houston if the
Portland team wants to sign the documents.

The original membership certificate needs to be in the lender's hands
(i.e.,
Isabel Parker's office) on Wednesday in order to release escrow.  If you
have the original to me by Tuesday, I can forward it to Isabel by overnight
delivery for Wednesday.  It must be an original, in that the lender's lien
on the membership interest is not perfected without possession of the
original certificate.  With respect to the remaining documents, fax copies
of signature pages on the closing date should be sufficient.

Can we at least get the membership certificates signed by Tuesday?  This
seems to be the only document required in advance of closing.  If we can't
get the 80% membership interest certificate in the lender's possession on
the closing date, then there is a lien perfection issue for them to deal
with, and I thought we could accommodate their request and avoid the
problem
altogether.  Please advise, as Greg and Isabel will be calling within an
hour or so to finalize the mechanics on this.  Thanks.

Can you get executed documents back to me on Tuesday?  Greg has requested
that we send the original membership certificate representing the 80%
interest to the collateral agent Tuesday night by overnight delivery to
hold
in escrow until closing, in order that the collateral agent is in
possession
of the certificate (for purposes of legal opinions) upon closing on
Wednesday.  Greg is planning to fax signature pages of all of their closing
documents later today.  (I will be out of the office at a meeting with
another client most of the afternoon today).

There is one last question with GE dealing with the letter of credit for
the
retention amount, as this affects our disbursement instruction letter.  I
advised Greg that GE's normal practice was to send the retention L/C after
receipt of payment.  He is considering this, but may want to talk to GE
about the ability to present the L/C at closing.  Do you have any thoughts
on this?

"The following points refer to the methodology that we are taking to rebook the New Albany Plant.  Please send me a note immediately if you disagree.
Assume that NewAlb is a non mark to market entity and Enron is the mark to market entity.  However, it is fully owned and operated by us for now.


*  The power mark to market book will pay NewAlb a capacity payment of $4.87 for 5 years.  We shaped this payment as follows:

2001 - $5.06
2002 - $4.96
2003 - $4.86
2004 - $4.75
2005 - $4.65

*  This payments allows Enron to supply gas to NewAlb and receive power. 

*  Enron will pay NewAlb $1000 per unit start.

*  Enron will also pay NewAlb $2.00/MW hour for varialbe o&m.

*  This will create an entity ""NewAlb"" that will return 9% assuming a book value of $336/kw on 12/31/2005 vs. 409 currently.

*  If NewAlb pays the 9% out that entity should be relatively flat each year for the next five."

So if you know of anyone who may be jobless over here, feel free  to have them contact me, or send them the attached draft job  description.      
 
Please stay in touch and best of luck to you.

Yes, ECT does not exist any longer. It's safer to say

"Chris,  The firm schedules referred to are those currently in place on the

Gerald,

In reviewing the changes I need to see what the ""Firm Schedules"" are.  This
looks like it is new and is apparently part of the Firm gathering
agreements.  Also, would it be possible to get a red-line version of the
documents that compares these latest changes with the originally executed
documents as I think some of the interim changes have been absorbed already.
Give me a call if you need any clarification.  713-624-9003.

Attached are the latest revised redlined documents for Lost Creek.   Please
note
the following:

1.  The changes include those that Chris and I discussed in Denver.  The
Capacity Allocation Agreement is redlined against the version BR had reviewed
earlier.  All other docs. are redlined against the originals.

2.  Due to the Credit Agreement structure, portions of the Natural Gas Fuel
Liquidation concept were placed into the Administrative Services Agreement.
This was done in order to allow that portion of the Natural Gas Fuel value
which
covers the Power Bill to be included in the Debt Service Coverage Ratio calcs
in
the Credit Agreement.  The remainder of the Natural Gas Fuel will be
distributed
under the Capacity Allocation Agreement to avoid the inclusive of these excess
amounts in any distribution tests under the Credit Agreement.

3.  Since more significant changes were made to the Admin. Services Agreement,
it is now being amended and restated.

Dean,  have you resolved the accounting questions you raised this past Monday?

Hi Group,

Need input for Lari as our ride approaches (Pat can you forward to Lu
and
ask him to reply to me).

I know some of you have ridden with Lari many times, but her scheduler
is
facilitating this process and has asked for some information.  Please
provide the following and I will batch and send to Lari:


Years riding
How often currently riding
type of riding (i.e. English lessons, dressage, trail)
type of saddle preferred
age, height and weight


Also, we initially planned on an all-day ride on Sat, and a four-hour
ride
on Sunday so we could all head back relatively early.  Lari would like
to
know where we want to ride on each day.  Nora is only riding for the
four-hour ride, and prefers the beach.  How about an all-day ride in the
redwoods on Saturday, with a four-hour beach ride on Sunday?

"Definitely clever!  I wish that I had thought of the changing the clock thing 
when the girls were younger and had slumber parties.  

I didn't know that there were computer games that work on higher level math 
skills.  I will definitely look into that for Meagan.  

I wish that we could meet for lunch.  Keep me posted on Cara  -- I have 
called her a little more frequently lately in hopes that she would spill the 
beans, but no movement on that yet!  

I think that next week we will know the schedule of games when Meagan will be 
dancing.  She did not make the dance for the first try-out.  It was jazz;  
not her strong suit.  But she did make the dances for the next two try-outs:  
a kick rountine and a pom routine.  There are two more try outs -- one more 
for kick and one more for pom. Hopefully she will make both.  Each routines 
is danced at two games -- one at home and one away.  So if she makes the next 
two dances, then she will be in 8 out of 10 dances for the football season.  
I think that she would feel pretty good about that.  The last two try-outs 
will be next week.  I will keep you posted.  

Have a great weekend.  Love, Sally

Sally,

Wish we could meet downtown for lunch--if only we weren't in different
downtown!

Bummer about Meagan--I agree that physics and precalc would be a killer.
You've probably looked into this but there are some great computer
""games/drills"" for math.  Brigeda does the early ones but there are some for
the heavy duty stuff as well...

Amanda must have aced that lock/locker and changing classes thing if she
loves her classes...

Brigeda doesn't start until the 21st.  It is always a strange week when all
the other kids (and her best friend) is in school--kind of waiting week but
we should be getting ready for her party.

GREAT IDEA:  I'm going to change the clocks in my house the night of the
slumber party--to 2 hour ahead.  So they can have their midnight swim and
snack (at 10pm!).  I don't know whether this makes me a creepy or clever
mom...

Let me know when you get Meagan's football schedule...Brigeda has been
moaning about wishing she was in Houston since we left...

Today is Cara's appt with the gyn/ob--maybe an announcement will be
forthcoming.

I'm meeting a guy I took my web certification classes with on Monday.  He
owns a design firm in Georgetown and has some freelance work.  It would be
great to be able to accelerate our return to solvency!

Talk to you soon...

That was always one of my favorites!  The old Parent Trap is always great
too,  I wish that I could be there. I know that Brigeda must be excited
about the slumber party.  When does she start school?  Today is day #2 for
the girls --Amanda loves her classes.  Meagan thought that the first day
""sucked"".  I have been on the phone with her counselor and assistant
principal this morning trying to undo a bad decision that she made on her
class selection.  Despite annual struggles with algebra and geometry, she
signed up for both Physics and Pre-Calc!!!   I don't know what she was
thinking!!  Amazingly, for a school as large as Klein, I was persuasive
enough with the assistant principal that they will ignore the July 22
deadline for changing your schedule and they will let her drop Physics and
add a study hall.  She still will take Pre-Calc, but she is in a regulars
class that will be a review of Algebra II during the first semester, which
is probably exactly what she needs.  I was prepared to go all the way to
the school board if necessary to get her a schedule that makes sense, but
luckily I didn't have to go that far.

Hope that you have a good weekend!  Love, sally

Charlene,

Please, help. This is a son of a professor at Berkeley who helps me a lot in 
the recruiting process.
His son goes to Cornell. Can we invite him (the son, not the professor) to a 
Super Saturday? I really want
to repay the debt to his father who is very instrumental in  my recruiting 
efforts.

Vince

"Hi

We are so bad - we suddenly woke up and realized that Friday is December 
1st.  That means Saturday is the 2nd - Sam's birthday.  SO I'm writing 
invitations now.  Here it is: 

Can Eleanor and Alice join us on Saturday for a train party at the zoo?  
Around 10:00?  We would love to have you all come too, or not, if you prefer 
to  ..... shop.

PS Hope your holidays were, well, a holiday."

Wanted you to be aware that Mayor Brown is inviting Jeff to meet with him, either in San Francisco or elsewhere.  Please advise, but I know that Jeff would probably not travel to California.

Mark Koenig and Andy Fastow will discuss meeting with Mayor Brown on the CalPERS issue.

Dear Mr. Skilling,

On behalf of Mayor Willie L. Brown, Jr. (San Francisco), it is my
pleasure to invite you to meet with him regarding energy issues in
California.

Mayor Brown wishes to meet with you in his capacity as a trustee of the
Board of Administration of the California Public Employees Retirement
System (CalPERS).  As you know, CalPERS is the largest public pension fund
in the
nation and is a sizeable investor in domestic energy stocks, bonds,
debentures, etc.  The Board has appointed Mayor Brown to lead a
delegation of trustees to meet with the CEOs of CalPERS' largest energy
holdings.  Enron represents one such holding.

The Mayor would be pleased to host you in his office at the newly
renovated City Hall in San Francisco or arrange an alternative location at
your earliest convenience.  I
will await your response.

Sincerely,

Monique Moyer
Director, Mayor's Office of Public Finance
City & County of San Francisco

goes to show you that it is all a state of mind.

I'm not sure how you don't focus on development, when it is all a part of the 
same group and process. Neat trick, though.  I wish Carlos was here to do a

As we move forward with CPs we need to know weather there is 1-way or 2-way termination payment methodology in the contract.  (Plan is to add a column to our spreadsheet to track this.)  You have mentioned that almost all CPs are 2-way.  What is the best approach to determining which CPs are 1-way versus 2-way?  

Additionally, there is other data we need to complete our spreadsheet, such as:
Contract type (ISDA, GTC, other)
Global contract number

Subject: Organizational Announcement - Introducing Enron Engineering and=20
Operational Services

In order to better align our engineering and operations capabilities with t=
he=20
commercial businesses they support, we are pleased to announce the followin=
g=20
organizational change will be effective immediately.  A new business unit,=
=20
Enron Engineering and Operational Services (EEOS), is being formed which wi=
ll=20
include our existing operations in Enron Engineering and Construction Compa=
ny=20
(EE&CC), Operational Energy Corporation (OEC), and National Energy Producti=
on=20
Corporation (NEPCO).

Brian Stanley, as President and Chief Executive Officer, and Keith Dodson, =
as=20
Chief Operating Officer will provide the leadership for this new=20
organization, reporting to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale=20
Services.  NEPCO will continue to operate as a stand-alone business under=
=20
John Gillis, President.

With the majority of EE&CC and OEC=01,s activities focused on assets and=20
projects which are in Wholesale Services, this will better align the effort=
s=20
of EEOS with the commercial businesses it supports.  While EEOS will be a=
=20
stand-alone unit within Enron Wholesale Services it will work very closely=
=20
with and have direct accountability to the business units it supports.

This realignment also centralizes our engineering and operations capabiliti=
es=20
in a single business segment and should ensure that innovation and best=20
practices are shared and implemented across our many operations and will al=
so=20
allow for better identification of priorities and more effective allocation=
=20
of resources to these projects.  Consistent with this approach, Development=
=20
Engineering will have dual reporting to both EEOS and the business units=20
which they support. =20

With an extensive and varied portfolio of assets around the world and a wid=
e=20
variety of new development opportunities available to Enron, it is critical=
=20
that we continue to maintain the best in class capability to design,=20
construct, commission, and effectively manage and operate Enron=01,s assets=
 on a=20
global basis.

This new global business unit should insure that we will continue to enhanc=
e=20
these demonstrated capabilities and provide us with a sustainable advantage=

as we advance our business strategy around the world.

Please join us in congratulating Brian and Keith on their new assignments.

I'd fill you in anyway. He's been talking to his contact at Constellation 
about changing these deals over, but hasn't received a concrete answer yet. 
I've reminded him and he said he WILL talk to the guy and resolve it today. 
I'll keep on it, and let you know when these deals have been changed.

Hi Bob, I was wondering if you have contacted Constellation about the 6 
trades that are in the system with the Cal Px as the index price.  All of 
these trades start flowing in July of this year.

The deal numbers are as follows:

453152.01
453175.01
453294.01
462109.01
471888.01
471889.01

Let me know if Constellation agrees to change these deals to the Dow Jones so 
I can send a letter for them to sign.

Thanks,
Melissa

"
"tomorrow is absolutely horrible for me.  let's talk in the am.  perhaps you 
and mona, sue and sandi can cover sans moi."
"Hey - what the heck is zero week? I might be interested in signing up for 
that - pack in some quick credits for my pre-grad school work. I figured out 
I'm going to essentially have to get a second bachelor's degree before going 
to grad school. But hey, it's all about the credentials man - as in, being 
able to tell people at my 10-year high school reunion that I have two 
bachelor's degrees, a master's, and a Rhodes Scholarship to study Italian 
wine in a 12th century villa, surrounded by buff, tan, and unusually 
good-looking farm workers.Tres important! 

So yeah, maybe we'll hold off on the visit for now. I think it's more 
important for us both to feel mentally stable about our finances for right 
now - then we party! I could maybe make it out there in April, overlap with 
mom's trip (I don't think I could handle the whole thing with her...) - I'll 
keep it in mind. And yeah, she's giddy about this whole house move thing. I 
hope it works out for the best - I really think it will. I'm starting to feel 
really bad about leaving Kitty with her, but I'm in a weird situation with 
Amber's cat at our house already. Part of me wants to just bring Kitty over 
and tell everyone to deal with it because it's my house too; but the other 
part of me doesn't want to deal with the bloodshed that will ensue between 
her and Amber's outmatched feline. Oh well, I'm thinking about it. 

The most excitement I'll be having this week is my haircut with Brett 
tonight. I think I might also be purchasing a bedskirt, a totally extraneous 
and disappointing expense that I would never have had if I hadn't insisted on 
getting a ""real"" house with a ""real"" bed and all that other crap that goes 
along with it and inevitably costs you money that you could have otherwise 
spent on beer. And as the sands flow, these are the days of our lives....

I'm so impressed with your dating maneuvers. I told Amber and Molly about it 
last night at dinner, which we ate together around our new dining room table, 
and they both said in unison, ""Like sister, like sister."" I guess I have some 
kind of reputation for ending up on dates with waiters - go figure. Anyway, 
it's time for me to go find something to eat and then come back to my desk 
and consume it while it flows directly to my butt. Can't wait! Write back 
soon.

Subject: RE:


I'm so glad to hear everything's better at your house!  I totally want to
come visit, but my last two paycheck deposits have only raised the balance
to $0 so it may be awhile.  I'm definitely coming in June, when I take a
zero week class in Eugene.  Mom's supposedly coming out here in April and we
might go to Glenwood Springs (hot springs, spa, MASSAGES!).  You should
come, too!  Fun female family bonding time!

I am so excited for Dad to visit, not just because of the car but also
because it will increase my quantity of social engagements by about 100%.
I'm a little worried about the effect it's having on Mom, who asked me when
he was coming so she wouldn't ""run into him"".  Like I would allow that to
happen - how stupid does she think I am?  But it sounds like she's pretty
stoked about this house thing, so I'm excited for her.

I have a date with that waiter guy tonight, but I'm not really that excited
because I am fat, ugly and on the third day of my period.  Did I mention
broke and car-less?  I think I should just put off this whole dating thing
until I increase MY net value (to use Kate-speak), which is just ground zero
for most people.  I am trying to pay off some debt (Dad took care of most of
it, but I didn't have the heart to show him my Nordstrom account).  It's
slow-going, though.  And car payments will not make it easy, but seriously
this city is so pedestrian-unfriendly that I feel I have no choice.  I tried
to go to my tennis lessons the other day and ended up walking along the
shoulder of a highway for twenty minutes.  And every person in Denver feels
the need to own a dog and allow it to bark menacingly at every passerby (I
am SO afraid of dogs after my brush with death in the form of a Doberman).
So I need a car,  and I don't care if it means weekly visits to the plasma
""donation"" center.

I actually met Marky's ex the other night (maybe don't mention to Amber - I
don't know why but the whole thing seems weird and I would rather stay out
of it).  Anyway, she is really cool!  She reminds me of my friend Jen
Sturmer, except less anorexic and depressed.  Speaking of, have you been
going out in Portland a lot?  I miss Veritable Quandary!  I haven't found
anything like that here yet.  Downtown has some cool bars, but you have to
pay $90 plus an appendage to park and cabs are not cheap either.  My
neighborhood has some good dives, like the one on our corner that has a
flickering neon sign outside announcing ""Don's Mixed Drinks"" - not sure, but
think that's the name of the bar.  I went in once and met Don, the king of
multiple body piercings here in Denver.

Okay, I'm rambling.  Time to get back to work (which is so good lately, by
the way!  I get to start grant-writing this month!).  Hope all's well for
you.  I'll give you the dirt on my date later, if my acne doesn't scare him
away in minute one.  Miss you, love you!!

Love, yo sista

Dearest Anna, my most favorite sister of them all!

I'm sorry I've been so bad about staying in touch while you've been stuck
in those Rocky Mountain highs and lows of life. It sounds like things are
going really well though (Rocky Mountain ""highs"") and that you've made it
through most of the tumult of moving to a new place (Rocky Mountain
""lows""). Amber tells me every time she talks to Marky, her man of the hour,
he mentions how they've got to get together with you when she comes to town
- which will be on next Friday, whoo hoo, party! I'm so mad that she gets
to go and I don't, being that I am not, like her, in my eighth year of
college and therefore do not enjoy such things as ""Spring Break Mania""
anymore. And Monica tells Marky who tells Amber who tells me that she'd
love to hang out with you more often. It sounds like you guys had a ball at
dinner, eh? So you've got options, girlfriend, which is worlds more than I
can say for my life at the mo'. It pretty much consists of working, eating,
and sleeping. I'm definitely looking into that SAD mental disorder thing,
because I think it's got me in its clutches. But the recent abundance of
sunshine has brought me enough renewed energy to start thinking about life
after winter. We're doing lots of gardening, cooking, and decorating at the
house - it's like having three Martha Stewarts all working together, only
slightly less stylish , immensely less efficient, and drunk. Other than
that, I've been trying to organize and simplify my life - taking care of
mounds of paperwork, paying off debts, sorting out all those nagging little
post-it notes that plague me constantly and demand my attention in vain.
I'm actually starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel, like maybe
I could buy a car or take a trip in a few months, or even buy a SECOND pair
of shoes, but let's not get wild and crazy just yet. So I heard Dad and
Laura are on their way to your neck of the woods with an automobile. That
is, in the immortal words of the guys in ""Dude, where's my car?"", SWEET...
DUDE! You are stoked. I bet that's a major load off - just make sure to
keep your finances in check and not get in over your head. Take it from one
who knows. I'm seriously looking into buying an old beater car; but then I
start fantasizing about the Audi A4 Quattro, and suddenly $30,000 doesn't
seem like a bad price for becoming ultimately cool. Lately I've been doing
a lot of research into self-improvement measures. I just applied for
post-baccalaureate status at U of O, so I can start taking economics and
poli sci classes online. (I just got my new FREE computer from work!) I'm
also studying for the GRE, and pretty soon here I'm going to get serious
about graduate school. I think I've decided on international studies and/or
economics, depending on how well I like the classes I take. I've found my
dream program at Johns Hopkins University in Washington, D.C. It's a
two-year Masters of International Studies program that begins in Washington
and ends in.....are you sitting down?.....Bologna, Italy! Holy shit, does
it get more perfect? Apparently it's like the premiere training ground for
government officials, according to my friend Andy who laughed forcefully in
my face when I told him I wanted to get into it. But I figure, I'm not
getting any younger, and I don't want any regrets, so I'm goin' for it,
dude. As for the love life, it's nonexistant, which is why I'm putting so
much energy into the self-improvement area of my life. I figure as long as
I'm having no fun with boys I might as well be beefing up my net value. By
the time they come around again, the eligible pool will have shrunk to 1 in
100 million. Whatever. Anyway, now that I've written you the longest
paragraph of my life, I must retreat to my work duties. Then it's off for a
thrilling tour of Portland via Tri-Met. Molly's making me dinner tonight in
exchange for a finished resume. It's only taken her 3 years to compile the
information for it, so this one should be a doozy. Hey, if you can ever
make it home for a weekend, you should come at the end of May - David Gray
is coming to the Schnitzer, and it's going to be fabulous! I'll buy your
concert ticket if you can convince Dad to get your plane ticket. Call me
soon if you can, or I'll call this weekend. Take care and I miss you!

Kate

Hey Lady!

What do you think you're doing?  I haven't talked to you in way too long.
You have to update me on the sitch!  I am going on a date with a guy I met
while out with Monica last weekend.  He was our waiter and he looks like
Chandler Bing, only Monica kept calling him Chanandler Bong (did you see
that episode when they had to name who the TV Guide came to?).  She is so
fun!  I was so glad to get out of my apartment/away from my roommate.  And
now I have a date, so I'm excited.  I'm still in contact with Mr.
Colorblind, but we've had the friends talk so it's been really cool.  In
fact, he's nicer to me now than he was before!  Anyway, that's crazy news
about Mom's house!  I guess no more crashing at her house when I go home.
How are your roommates?  Your seattle boyfriend?  Your job?  Write me with
the goods, woman.  I am getting a car in two weeks and I am more excited
than any car-buyer has ever been.  My job is great, although i think I'm
getting scoliosis from bad posture in an uncomfortable chair all day.
Nothing else is happening.  Are you going out for St. Patrick's Day?  I
have
to work, but there's a big outdoor thing downtown that I might go to
afterwards.  Okay, must go work.  Call me though!  I miss you!

Greetings Professor:

Our group consists of Jeff Dasovich, Mark Guinney, Anil Sama and Carolyn
Vavrek.

We propose to examine the recently failed acquisition by Coke of Quaker
Oats:  Why merge?  What was the value?  Upside?  Downside?  Why did it go
bust?  Should it have gone through?  What's up with this Buffet guy,
anyway?

If you have any concerns with this proposal, please let us know.

Finally, if possible, we'd like to present on Thursday, April 26th.

Best,
Jeff

In definition of spot market service, I would change 30 days to at least
90 days, not require the choice of there is no longer a competitive and
viable retail market, and maybe require the utility to come up with
something within that 90 day period.  I would also take out the language
that was added at the end of the first sentence and not replace it
unless we can get a clearer statement from Jeff of what he means.
Jeff-can you come up with something clearer? Barbara

"Based on latest info hear's latest assessment of Gov's talk:

I'm in charge.
Here's all the wonderful things I've done thus far to address the crisis 
(likely to include Edison TX talks, since it seems he has no choice but to 
continue that charade).
It's bad and getting worse and we've got to pull together as a state to get 
through it.
Rate increases are a necessary evil that---painful as they are, and they will 
be painful---must be part of the solution; and future increases may well be 
likely.
Blame FERC and the generators, because it's their fault.
Windfall profits is a good idea.

Miss Tana,

Are you interested in going to the Nutcracker Market this Saturday morning
and being there for the early bird special (8 a.m.)??  It costs $25 to get
in early, but that covers $10 admission, $5 parking, coffee and
refreshments.  Otherwise, you can go at 10 a.m., pay $10 to get in with the
rest of the crowd and $5 for parking.  I think I am going to plan to be
there around 7:40-7:45.  Let me know if you are interested.

Patti

"whadup! i'm so happy for you re: the love thing. love is sooooo in the air 
lately. molly just fell head over heels for some cowboy dude evan introduced 
her to. they've been attached at the hips, literally, for the last three 
weeks. and amber spends about four quality hours a day on the phone with 
marky, then cries when she has to hang up. seriously. but your romance sounds 
much more interesting - you absolutely have to keep me posted on how it 
unfolds. and what's the guy's name anyway? you know what's weird is that last 
night after my haircut i met up with molly and her man for dinner. we decided 
to check out the brazen bean, this little swanky cigar bar across the street 
from the blue moon on 21st. (we heard they had a martini happy hour, and we 
felt like pretending we were sophisticated.) so we're walking into the place 
when molly suddenly remembers that she knows the people who live upstairs 
(it's in one of those old rambling victorian houses) so she runs upstairs to 
say hi and then comes back down with them. it turns out to be blake and jill, 
this really sweet couple i've met before, friends of friends, you know how it 
goes. anyway, we all end up staying longer than we should and having more 
martinis than we planned on, and then blake remembers his friend dave was 
coming over to watch a movie. so he runs upstairs to meet dave and brings him 
back down. well dave happens to be amazingly cute and have amazingly great 
legs (he had just come from the gym and was amazingly good about sitting in 
this dimly lit velvet-couched candle-lit shi-shi joint in shorts and a 
sweatshirt). so dave, molly tells me as she begins to put the hard sell on 
IMMEDIATELY (i've noticed as i get older and stay single that many of my 
friends feel the need to try vehemently to get me coupled), plays the guitar 
amazingly and has an amazing voice. i find out over the course of the evening 
that he also reads A LOT and is interested in irish literature and quantum 
physics. well, who isn't, y'know. he also likes to sail - and this is really 
quite scary - LASER SAILBOATS. yep. i've officially met my father in a 
younger form. barf. anyway, he and blake and i all had a jolly time talking 
about books and parents and that show blind date. it was all very 
intellectual, i assure you. what was weirder still was that every time i said 
something, dave looked at blake and kind of laughed. and every time i was 
like, stop your laughing or i'll beat you senseless, and he was like, no i'm 
just laughing because we were just talking about that the other day or 
because i've done that or because i'm doing that next week. i said i wanted 
to start a book club - apparently he suggested that to blake two days ago. i 
said i lived in italy and wanted to go back - he's going there in two months. 
oh, and then there's our common love of running. okay, i'm rambling, so i'll 
get to the point, which is that in my single and cynical state i didn't think 
much of the poor guy last night, but today i've noticed i'm increasingly 
interested and, i'll admit, maybe even attracted. so as we were leaving i 
kind of waved goodbye and said see ya around, because you always do in an 
incestuous vat such as portland, and went on my merry way with molly and 
josh, which i'm sure they were happy about since they practically tried to 
push me into dave's car and run away. dave got in his car and drove off, then 
all of a sudden appeared in front of us as we were crossing the street to our 
car. he had driven around the block and was now getting out of his car to 
give me his card, which he handed to me under the pretense that we couldn't 
start a book club without each other's contact information. i already knew he 
worked at a running store, whatever that is, but when i turned the card over 
it had his name on it and the word ""owner"" underneath. do you think that 
means he's the actual owner? or is it one of those places like les schwab 
where they give all the employees stock options and call them ""employee 
owners""? i'm going to look into it. now i'm probably making way too much of 
this because he was probably like, yeah i need some more members for my book 
club but i definitely don't want to talk to this drinking, smoking, lump of 
unmolded flesh for any other reason....why would i, the proprietor of a 
running store and owner of such amazing legs, do a thing like date a girl who 
shudders at the thought of exercise and loses weight only when she ups her 
alcohol consumption to the point where she forgets to eat? that would just be 
silly. okay, i've got to go. get back to me with a detailed account of your 
evening such as the one i just sent you.

"I agree with you 100%.  I hope that Mike can make it clear to John that it is 
never appropriate to criticize another department - whether Legal or anyone 
else - in such a public manner.  If he feels there is a problem that should 
be corrected, he should proceed through proper channels.  In this case, a 
direct one-on-one conversation with Andrea strikes me as the most obvious 
route and if that is not possible, not productive or just too awkward, he 
should have approached either you or Mike.  Sending out an e-mail that might 
be considered personally critical of Andrea in such a public way is clearly 
contrary to our core value of Respect.  I hope you are able to have some

Subject:	RE: Franchise Players and the Draft

The snake thing is good and bad.   But I think the first round should be
randomly selected for ALL teams because the current way gives those not
keeping a franchise player a double benefit by picking in the supplemental
and then also at the top of the first round.   Theoretically the non keeper
teams are getting the 8-14 best players who are arguably also franchise
players.  In effect by not keeping a player you are randomly selecting a
lower level franchise player.  So they shouldn't get the an automatic shot
at 15-22 or whatever it might be as well.  So snake or no snake all of round
one should be random order.

Sara,

Marie was able to incorporate the changes to Glendale's ISDA and send them a final draft.  I am waiting to hear from them to send them an executable copy.  Marie did not know how to proceed with obtaining the outside council opinion.  Could we start that process when you return?  I think that is the only thing we are waiting for.  Let me know if there is anything I can do to help.

"Steve,

The Journal of Risk is a more technical and serious publication
than RISK MAgazine.

If the article is published it will give you more exposure in 
the academic circles.  I think it will be a significant
accomplishment.

On the downside, it does not receive the same wide circulation as RISK
among the practitioners.

I can also see the reason behind the recommendation given
by Navroz: the article is fairly long for RISK.

"Francisco,

You should have gotten my email back to Justin.

 We have two sets of online customers coming thru, one set that originates 
from Houston Credit and one set originates from London Credit.  We are 
responsible for responding for Houston Credit based customers, and London 
Legal for London based customers.

A side issue to all of this is how we gather legal advice on trading around 
the world.  We don't want to duplicate efforts and costs by having both 
Houston and London Legal Departments requesting separate advice.  Our office 
is responsible for legal advice in the Americas and Southeast Asia, while 
London leads the efforts in Europe .  After we each receive advice we provide 
copies and communicate to each other the advice received.  Even though we 
both receive the same legal advice, sometimes we don't always agree on the 
approach in a particular country, and at the end of the day, each Legal Dept. 
is responsible for their own clients.

As far as the advice on Mexico, Chile and Argentina, as I told Justin, the 
advice I have received from the Houston lawyers is that although we can 
transact financial products in these countries, we have certain legal risks 
in doing so, and we need to do corporate due diligence to check their 
appropriate corporate documents to see if they are allowed to do these, and 
further, most of these counterparties have not filed consents to service of 
process here in the U.S., which we require in order to trade with us.  Since 
what these counterparties usually want to trade are physical products, we 
don't waste our time doing the due diligence at this point.  If a 
counterparty really wanted to trade financial we would spend the time 
resolving those issues.

As you become the responsible lawyer, first in Mexico, and maybe in the rest 
of South America, you may have a different opinion on these issues and we can 
certainly change our policies at any time.  All of the above is just what my 
current direction is from our lawyers.

Hi Francisco

Just so that I can inform the rest of my team and the marketing people - why 
is it that we require Masters with Mexican counterparties and not with 
counterparties from other countries?  Would it make any difference if the 
Enron Entity was in the UK like Enron Metals Limited rather than US?

Does this apply for offline trading as well?

Lara

 I am the ""new"" lawyer in charge of our financial trading operations in 
Mexico.

I am told that we do not trade financial with any Mexican counterparty 
without going through our normal due diligence process.  At the end of the 
day we need a Master in place with any Mexican counterparty with whom we 
trade (financial) online or otherwise.  I checked and we do not have a Master 
in place with this counterparty.

salaries are absurd), and I guess I'm glad to see Ausmus come back.  However, 
he is not a substitute for a pitcher.  And how is Shane?

"It is hard for me to say how this would work on behalf of all of my direct 
reports.  Sometimes it is tough to have all assistants out at once.  To meet 
at 3:00, you all would have to leave around 2:30, which could be early in the 
day for some groups to lose assistants.    Would it work to start a little 
later in the afternoon?  If before 5:00, I think that all assistants will 
have to check with their managers on the convenience of an earlier departure 
time.  --Sally

Hi Sally
Hope you had a great Easter!
Are you okay with us leaving the office early on Wed May 3rd?
Sometimes it is hard for some to break for lunch and others can't do a dinner 
after work.  I thought mtg at 3pm would be inbetween.  And give everyone a 
chance to relax without thinking about coming back to work.
I wanted to check with you before I asked for RSVP's.
Thank you

Hi Ladies,
If you don't know already, Patti Thompson (Sally's Assistant) is now an 
official Enron Employee!!!!  Yeah!!!!!  I couldn't be more pleased and would 
like to arrange a get together to welcome her to our group!  Plus, we haven't 
all gotten together for awhile!  Instead of having lunch or dinner, maybe we 
can meet in between.

 How about this? 
Little Papasito's (on Westhiemer and Kirby) or Tilah's (on West Dallas)
Wednesday, May 3rd
Meet at the restaurant at 3:00pm
There is one thing about this. . . .no returning to the office!
(It hasn't been decided whether to go to Papasito's or Tilah's, place your 
vote!)

I  would love to accommodate as many assistants as possible.  So if this 
conflicts with many of your schedules, we can be flexible on the date.
Please let me know what you think as soon as you can.  I'll keep everyone 
posted!
Lynn

Per your request, here is what we have decided:

1. Our 2 best candidates were Jackie McCoy and Samantha Boyd.  As I mentioned 
to you, Mark will be talking to HR about making an offer to Samantha Boyd but 
until she formally accepts, we don't want to lose Jackie or say anything to 
her.

2. We have passed on the following candidates:

Stephanie Panus
Patricia Slaughter
Donald Duhon
Debra Vincent


Of this group, we may pass on to other groups that have expressed interest  
to Mark Taylor in hiring for a non-legal position, the resumes of Stephanie 
Panus and Debra Vincent and certainly Jackie McKoy if Samantha accepts.  It 
would be helpful to know from you when these particular  passed over 
candidates have been notified so that we don't cause confusion if we send 
their resume elsewhere.

Also, do you have references for Samantha?

Anyway, let me know what I can do for Prentice's birthday. Do you want me to

Stella:

The Swift deal is not pathed correctly in POPS.  I set up an accounting 
arrangement on the 012-41500-02-015 contract with the Track ID 80705.  Would 
you put the contract in POPS with the associated Track ID?  

The transportation contract (012-41500-02-003) for the Liquids Replacement 
gas is not POPS.  I looked in Path Manager and there is no deal for it 
either.  In December, the deal for this gas was 114096.  Could you extend the 
deal or get me the number for the new deal if there is one?  I need to set up 
an accounting arrangement so I will need for you to verify the deal number 
and transportation contract that this gas is supposed to go on.  When I set 
up the accounting arrangement I will let you know what the Track ID is so you 
can put the contract at meter 9643.

Let me know when all of this is done so that I can reallocate the meter.

Jeff--so what is a state librarian?  Must be a west coast kind of specialty!!

With regard to Glen Thomas, I believe that he is the newly appointed chair who was previously Governor Tom Ridge's policy guy in the governor's office. I think he is pretty young (early thirties) and that he still has strong ties in that office and should be vocal on markets working and political leadership (the right kind!) being neccesary.  Steffes might be able to give you more insight, but if my recollection is right, he wasn't involved in the early PECO fights--I think he came on the scene a little later.

The Roundtable will be moderated by the State Librarian, Kevin Starr.  The other roundtable-ists include:

Chuck Cicchetti (Edison plant?  Anyone know what he's up to these days?)
Bob Foster--Edison
Nettie Hoge--head of TURN
Glen Thomas--Chair of the Pennsylvania PUC (any info on Chair Thomas is appreciated)
State Senator Debra Bowen
David Freeman--Self-appointed emporer
Dr. Joseph Pratt--History prof., University of Houston (any info on the professor is also appreciated)

Each of us will have two minutes to open and then Dr. Starr will moderate the ensuing mud-slinging.

Attached are some draft talking points that I threw together for your review.  All comments, suggestions, guffaws, etc. are welcome and appreciated.

Please see comments on PG&E strategy.  I have made some modifications to be 
more consistent with the three main messages of the ISO MSC report dated 
9/6/00.  Any proposal should address the three messages of this report 1) 
Eliminate mandatory UDC day ahead purchase requirement from PX (this may 
allow generators to exercise mkt power during time periods of high demand) 
and allow utilities to hedge forward purchases in bilateral markets at 
shareholder risk, 2) Provide demand price signals in PG&E/SCE service 
territories ASAP but no later than 10/1/2001 and 3) eliminate incentive for 
large SCs to under schedule in ISO real time market (adopt ISO proposals for 
imbalances in excess of 250 MW per hour).

Notice to all Appalachian Pool Operators:           Received 3/29/00  2:00 pm
Reclassification Notice                            Posted 3/29/00  2:00 pm

On February 10, 1999, the FERC approved Docket No. CP97-549, granting CNG 
Transmission's (CNGT's) request for reclassification of various transmission 
lines to gathering lines.  As part of that Docket, several transmission lines 
were denied to gathering.  On March 12, 1999, CNGT filed for rehearing to 
further support the reclassification of the lines denied reclassification.   
On March 21, 2000, the FERC approved Docket No. CP97-549-001, granting 
reclassification of five lines from transmission lines to gathering lines.  
The newly reclassified gathering lines include: D-2149, H-19921, LN-943, 
H-124 and H-21777 south of Bradley Compressor Station.  On March 22, 2000, 
CNGT filed new tariff sheets to implement the reclassification effective 
April 1, 2000.  Although the FERC has not yet granted approval of the tariff 
sheets, CNGT is notifying producers that upon approval of the new tariff 
sheets, CNGT will begin charging a gathering rate of $0.198/Dt. and a fuel 
retention of 2.28% for all gas moved on the lines listed above.  If you have 
questions regarding this notice, please contact Nancy Aucremanne at 
(304) 623-8698 or Celesta Miracle at (304) 623-8262.

Dear Pool Operator:

 CNG Transmission Corporation (CNGT) plans to take its Hastings 
Extraction Plant (H.E.P.) out of service to perform annual maintenance 
starting at 12:01 a.m. on Tuesday, September 12, 2000.  This requires 
that the ""wet gas"" system behind the H.E.P. in West Virginia be shut in.  
The plant shutdown will last approximately twenty-one (21) days if no 
unexpected problems arise during the shutdown.  Normal plant operations 
are scheduled to resume on Tuesday, October 3, 2000.  All questions 
concerning the shut in and the subsequent turn in should be directed 
to CNGT's local operations supervisor in the production area.

 Unless other arrangements have been made to move gas to markets 
other than on CNGT, all wet gas production must be shut in by 5:00 p.m. 
on Monday, September 11, 2000.  This will allow our compressor stations 
to pull down the field pressure prior to going completely down at midnight 
and will ensure that we maintain the time-lines on our schedule.  As per 
CNGT's tariff, failure to shut in by 5:00 p.m. will result in CNGT 
considering 
the gas to be unauthorized and it will not be credited as a delivery to your 
pool.

 As the exact time the plant will resume service is very difficult 
to determine, and in an effort to minimize confusion, producers in your 
pool will need to coordinate the turn in of their production with CNGT's 
local operations supervisor. We are also asking that all pool operators 
notify producers in their pool of this shut in.  CNGT will not notify 
producers individually.

 We appreciate your cooperation and assistance on this.  I also wanted 
to you to know that we are attempting to complete all work necessary for us 
to avoid shutting down the plant next year.  The next regularly scheduled 
shut       down will not be until 2002.

 If you have any questions about this letter, please feel free to 
contact me at (304) 623-8698. 

      Sincerely,



      Nancy M. Aucremanne
      Manager, Producer Services
      And Business Agreements

Subject: Airline seats

Sally,

Per Catherine at Travel Agency in the Park, bulkhead seats were all that were 
available when she booked flight 3 or 4 weeks ago.  Says those particular 
flights have gotten quite popular lately.  Only other option for return:

Same isle (E)
 - Row 8 (also bulkhead, but maybe not as noisy)
 - Last row window seat (doesn't recline as much as other seats)

If you like either of these better that existing seat, let me know & I change 
it.

"Peter,

Mark took a look at your termination and he thought it looked fine.  
Actually, he liked your termination and release better than the language we 
have in our form, so we're changing our form.  You are the man!

I checked the New York law when I drafted the termination so you're ok 
there.  

I'll be out all next week, my Mom's coming into town for the Thanksgiving 
holidays.  If you need to get hold of me my assistant will have my cell phone 
number (since it's NYMEX bid week and both Mark and I will be out, I have to 
be reachable.  Mark will have an international cell phone with him, he's 
sailing in the Caribbean, so if you need to get hold of him for any reason, 
Taffy will have the number).

Let me know if I can be of further help today!"

Your insight and provacative discussion provided an excellent framework for the business case we were trying to communicate. If I can ever be of any assistance to you, please feel free to call me.

"Peter, let's set aside at least one-half hour to talk about the approval 
process and general communication and any issues you want to.  Please get it 
scheduled. Thanks.  Mark"
"Whew!! Your schedule makes me tired!  I am sure that Brigeda is happy that 
you are involved in so many activities with her school - and then on the 
other hand, sometimes you wonder if they notice!  Work sounds crazy for you, 
but how nice that you will be off from December 21 until the 2nd.  

I hope that make it over the week before Christmas.  The week is kind of 
crazy for us, so I am trying to find a time that will work.  Sunday the 17th 
we are having a dessert party at our house, inviting neighbors, old Huntwick 
friends, etc.  It is for families, and Meagan and Amanda each included 4 of 
their friends in the invitiation list, along with their familities.  It will 
be multi-generational - I hope fun, as it would be a nice tradition to 
continue.  On Monday, I think that David plans to take Tyler and Amanda to 
Longview for a visit.  A commitment that Meagan and I have to sort toys at 
Northwest Assistance Ministries from 12:30 to 4:00 that day has excused us 
from the trip.  So it may be best for Meagan and me to drive over to Austin 
after 4:00 on Monday.  We could be back by the time David and company return 
to Houston on Tuesday afternoon.  Wednesday we have matinee tickets to see A 
Christmas Carol at the Alley  Theater, sans Tyler.  Thursday I am having all 
of my girls in NCL over to wrap gifts for the family that we have adopted for 
Christmas and then we will deliver the presents.  And Friday is Tyler's 
birthday, with a 102 Dalmation theme planned (cake ordered from RJ Goodies, 
but nothing else done yet!).  So I really think that our only shot to make it 
to Austin is for Monday night, which would mean only Meagan and me.  

I talked with Mom last night and invited Dad and her to Houston for 
Christmas.  I don't really think that they will come, but if they do, I hope 
that doesn't mess up your Christmas.  They have only been here for one or two 
Christmases with us since we have had kids.  I think that Tyler at 3 this 
year will be particularly enthralled.  And next year they will have 2 
grandchildren in Austin, so it just seemed that this could be a good year for 
them to come.  She said she would think about it, and I told her that I 
wanted her to know that we would love to have them, but that it was perfectly 
okay if they decided that they did not want to come.  

How about Dad playing golf this week?  What a difference!! I am so glad that 
he is doing better.  

I hear you about Mom.  I think that a blow-up or some drama is highly 
predictable, unfortunately.  She seems to do that a lot at special occassions 
for Cara, doesn't she?  I will certainly help in any way I can.  And I will

Subject: RE: Baby Shower


Got your message last night--sorry I missed you--must have been in the
shower.  We are all going nuts here, too.  We have a huge deadline here at
work.  But I worked most of last weekend so am ahead of the curve.  Good
thing, since I have volunteered to be Martha Stewart at many school events
this week and next.  LAst night was ""lessons and carols"" by the school
choir--with me decorating, baking, and coordinating.  Today I go to school
to make Christmas stockings with the kids--Sunday is the school Christmas
Bazaar at the Four Seasons--need to bring an item for the bake sale.  Also
need to start baking 12 gingerbread houses for Brigeda's class.    Did find
a matching mold to the smaller one we have so I can at least bake two at
once--twelve bakes is MUCH better than 24!  And then there is that dollhouse
that needs my attention by the 25!

I am totally ok with us not doing the shower.  We get credit for offering
but don't have to do anything.  Both money and time are in such short supply
for me that it works out for the best.  At work we start on a contract for
Dell in January.  The company is also going to pay for Java programming
classes for some of us (if I can nail this down then I can jump up to a
programmer level on that pay scale).  I also have a private contract job
with a needlepoint store in Memphis to setup their website.

Am somewhat concerned that Mother will have one of her dramas when Cara's
baby comes...you know she will get her feelings hurt somehow.  Not to
mention the fact that she will be sharing the grandchild with ""the most
selfish woman on earth.""  Richard and Brigeda went out to the Lowrimore farm
(they sold it and offered us all of the firewood).  Jane couldn't have been
sweeter to Brigeda--spent a lot of time with her.  Can just imagine that
""pained"" look in Mother's face at the hospital.  If you are not here may
need you to carry your cell phone so I can call for moral support--or at
least give you gossipy updates on the drama....

Are you planning to come later this month when you are off?  I'm taking off
the 21st and 22nd--they have given all of the technical production staff the
days between Christmas and New Years as comp time so I will be off until the
2nd...

Subject: CPCN Update

Sami Salib of the Public Staff is drafting the agenda item that will go on
the Commission's Open Agenda Conference for approval to establish the
procedural schedule for the CPCN application (intervention dates, intervenor
testimony, rebuttal testimony, etc).  Although he wanted to schedule the
evidentiary hearing for the last week in September, the Commisssion's
calendar is currently full.  So he has tentatively scheduled it for Monday,
October 2.  The problem with that is that it makes it virtually impossible
to meet the November 1 construction date if the Commission allows the
customary 30 days after the hearing in which to file briefs and proposed
orders.  I urged Sami to please see if he could calendar the hearing for the
third week in September.  

One of the things that ENA will have to do is to have notice published in
newspapers in the Rocky Mount area for several consecutive weeks prior to
the hearing so that affected persons will have an opportunity to comment.  I
am trying to get Sami to place the draft agenda item and procedural schedule
on the Commission's July 31 Open Agenda Conference so that the notices can
start to run August 7.  That action, along with scheduling the hearing for
the third week in September, will make it far more likely than not that the
CPCN will issue before November 1.  

Failing that, we can work with the Public Staff to shorten the period within
which to file briefs and proposed orders after the hearing to three or
preferably two weeks.  It will not be difficult to do that if there are no
intervenors, or if the intervenors do not object.

Sami has promised to let me know by tomorrow when the agenda item will go
before the Commission, and the dates in the procedural schedule.  Please
call me if you have questions.  Thanks.

Nicor Gas Company once Adnan has received the proper name change

under Nicor Gas Company.  Once these changes are made in GCP, the contract 
can be changed to the trade name if still needed at that time.

Per my conversation with Nicor Gas Company's attorney, Northern Illinois Gas 
Company changed its name to Nicor Gas Company. Therefore, Nicor Gas Company 
is the only entity that all the deals needs to be booked under. However, the 
attorney also agreed to the fact that they do use the name ""Northern Illinois 
Gas Company d/b/a Nicor Gas Company"" eversince the name change happened. He 
said they had been using both names ""contractually"" and interchangeably even 
though it is all just ONE company, one state registered company.

I'm currently waiting on name change documents, however this is what it looks 
like thats going to happen:
The main HQ company would end up being NICOR GAS COMPANY with all the 
trades/contracts/deals being merged into one record. However, if need be we 
could have a Tradename set up as ""Northern Illinois Gas Company d/b/a Nicor 
Gas Company"" since this is how the company does business as, in some cases.

There appears to be confusion over who and what products we should be trading 
with these entities.

We have an ISDA Master Agreement in place with Northern Illinois Gas Company 
d/b/a Nicor Gas Company.  This is a new master.  If the counterparty is not 
set up this way it need to be.

Physical gas has a master in place with Northern Illinois Gas Company.

There is no master agreement in place with Nicor Gas Company and the only 
trading being done with this entity is online gas trading.

The issue that needs to be resolved is whether we want to trade gas under 
both Northern Illinois Gas Company and Nicor Gas Company.  Frank Davis will 
resolve this issue with Tom Moran in Credit and Stacy Dickson with physical 
gas Legal, and they will let us know who we should be trading with.

When we hear back from them we can finally resolve what counterparty names we 
want to set up and get back to the counterparty if we have not received the 
correct Password Application to match out intended trading partners.

Sorry for all the confusion this is causing.  I am confused too.

State's Electric Bill Gets Lighter


Energy: Davis and the PUC clash over why only a fraction of the 20% reduction will be passed on to consumers.

By MIGUEL BUSTILLO
Times Staff Writer

October 20 2001

SACRAMENTO -- California now expects its electricity bill to be 20% less than estimated as recently as two months ago, opening the door for utility rate reductions or a smaller energy bond sale, the Davis administration said Friday. 

Even so, the amount of savings passed on to consumers is likely to be closer to 5%, the administration added. 

The discrepancy and its explanation are an extension of the ongoing political squabble between Gov. Gray Davis and Public Utilities Commission President Loretta Lynch. Administration officials said residential customers won't see much relief because recent actions by the PUC have negated most of the gains from lower power prices and greater conservation. 

Specifically, officials said, the PUC erred in giving business customers too much time to opt out of the state's power-buying system, and in holding up a bond sale to repay expensive energy loans. 

Lynch disagrees on both points. The real problem, she said again Friday, is that California purchased too much power at too high a price during the energy crisis. The best way to save consumers money, she suggested, is to renegotiate the state's energy contracts. 

California has been purchasing massive quantities of power since January because the state's large private utilities could no longer do so, and mass blackouts threatened to cripple the state's economy and endanger the public. The utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric, San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison, ran up billions of dollars in debts because they were forced to buy power for far more than they could legally charge customers. 

In August, state officials estimated the department's power costs for 2001 and 2002, the time the state plans to be in the power business, at $21.45 billion. The new estimate, released Friday, pares that figure to $17.2 billion. 

But in what consumer groups angrily called a ""jailbreak,"" Davis administration officials disclosed for the first time Friday that large businesses fled the state's power-buying system en masse this summer, opting to cut their own deals with energy companies rather than shoulder their share of the state's power costs. 

Big Businesses Bail Out, Leave Tab to Consumers

The PUC announced in June that it was putting a lid on the so-called direct-access deals because if the businesses left the system, homeowners and other small ratepayers would have to pay a larger share of the costs the state incurred buying power to avert blackouts in the energy crisis. 

However, the commission did not act until last month, and in the meantime numerous businesses opted out of the state system. Direct-access participation jumped from 2% to 13% of the overall power load being purchased by the California Department of Water Resources, according to the administration's latest numbers. 

""Unfortunately, all of the savings generated by the improving market conditions will not be immediately passed on to ratepayers,"" said Pete Garris, who oversees the department's power-buying division. ""Put simply, the PUC's delay in suspending direct access means [the state's] costs will have to be recovered from fewer customers and the impact will be greatest on smaller, retail customers."" 

State Treasurer Phil Angelides, who requested that the PUC suspend direct access earlier in the summer, blasted the commission Friday, saying the ""stampede"" of businesses would shift as much as $8 billion in costs to consumers over the next decade, as they pay for the long-term contracts the state signed this year to ensure a stable source of electricity. 

""What's happened here is one of the most damaging things that's happened to consumers in this energy crisis,"" Angelides said. 

And consumer groups were even more critical, accusing the PUC of letting big business escape the costs of the energy crisis. 

""The PUC first gave Edison their bailout,"" said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, referring to the legal settlement recently approved by the commission to rescue the utility. ""Now we find that big business is in effect getting bailed out of the energy crisis. These were the two groups, the big business guys and the utilities, that got us in this mess in the first place."" 

But Lynch, the PUC president, said the number conflicted with the commission's figures, which showed direct access participation at roughly 8% of the overall load. That, she said, was similar to the number of businesses participating in direct access at the beginning of the year, a little more than 7%, before the energy crisis erupted. It fell to a low of 2% during the crisis because some energy companies realized they could make more money on the open market and breached their deals with state businesses, she said. 

Lynch accused Angelides and the Davis administration of revisionist history, saying the commission postponed its decision at the administration's request. The commission then put off the decision again because the Legislature was considering its own solution to the problem, she said. 

The real problem, Lynch said, is that the state has too much electricity under contract at too high a price. If California had not purchased too much power, consumers would not have to pay for it, she said. 

""If people are leaving the system, those are fewer people [the state] needs to serve,"" Lynch said. ""The problem, once again, is the long-term contracts. We need to renegotiate these contracts."" 

Also adding to the state's financial burden is the fallout from a $4.3-billion energy loan the state took out this summer that it will not be able to repay in time, driving up the loan's interest rates. 

The loan was supposed to be repaid by the state's planned $12.5-billion energy bond sale to replenish the billions spent from the state budget on electricity this year. But the bond deal is now in limbo, in part because the PUC has refused to take action on a rate agreement that is required for the bond sale to move forward. As a result, a series of escalating interest rates spelled out in the loan deal are being triggered, which will soon force the Department of Water Resources to make payments to the bankers from its reserve. 

Davis and Aides Stay Tight-Lipped on Strategy

In a related development, the newly created state public power authority, headed by S. David Freeman, met Friday to consider approving millions of dollars worth of energy conservation and generation projects, but none were adopted because the authority learned it had no money to finance them. 

If the bond deal ever takes place, the state may be in a position to meet its financial obligations and possibly lower utility rates, which were raised this year in response to the energy crisis. The state may also have the option of floating a smaller bond, though advisors to the governor called that less likely. 

In another action that could reduce rates, Davis administration officials confirmed Friday that they are planning to renegotiate some of the long-term power contracts, as The Times reported Thursday. The contracts have been criticized by consumer groups and some legislators for being inflexible and expensive. 

But Davis advisors remained tight-lipped on the specifics, saying only that they have a strategy to convince power companies to open talks. 

""I don't think it's real smart to tell you that,"" said Barry Goode, the governor's legal affairs secretary."

Hi.

How's it going?

Any more thoughts on tomorrow night?  We could ask your mother to sit for a
little while.  I think it is pretty neat to get invited to the Enron one.

The head of the power trading legal group stopped by and said to let her
know if I ever want to change groups.  I thought that was nice.

I'm contemplating doing something special with Michael over spring break.
I figure you guys have lots of ""guy only"" stuff coming up, but there aren't
a lot of ""mom/son"" opportunities.  (be realistic)  Maybe we should take a
Disney cruise, since that's something you wouldn't like to do.

Love,

"Enron to cut one-fifth of jobs at broadband unit.

04/06/2001
Reuters English News Service 
(C) Reuters Limited 2001. 

HOUSTON, April 6 (Reuters) - Energy trading giant Enron Corp. said on Friday 
it will eliminate some 250, or roughly 20 percent, of the jobs at its 
broadband telecommunications unit, detailing a move which it has previously 
described as an internal redeployment of staff. 
Enron Broadband Services spokeswoman Kelly Kimberly said the company is 
cutting jobs at the unit, which now employs 1,150 people, because it has 
completed the build-out of its 18,000-mile (29,000 km) fiber-optic network 
and because of slow demand for streaming media products delivered to personal 
computers.
""The network is substantially complete now, so that means fewer people are 
required for technical positions,"" she said. 
The job cuts also reflect Enron Broadband's decision to play a less active 
role in the market for streaming media services, such as video of corporate 
events delivered to personal computers, where demand had been slower than 
expected, she said. 
However, Kimberly said Enron Broadband will continue to pursue 
entertainment-on-demand services actively. 
Kimberly said employees whose jobs are being eliminated will be eligible for 
redeployment to other positions at Enron Broadband Services or other Enron 
units, although there could be some involuntary terminations. 
Previously Enron officials had dismissed rumors about job cuts at Enron 
Broadband Services and had spoken instead of an internal redeployment of 
staff within the unit without detailing its impact on overall employment 
there. 
The company's stock, which peaked at just above $90 last year and was trading 
in the $80s as recently as mid-February, has recently fallen into the $50s in 
line with broader weakness in the stock market and among technology and 
telecommunications stocks in particular. On Friday it was up 95 cents at 
$56.65. 
Since early last year Enron has been building a high-speed broadband 
communications network that it plans to use as a base to build a bandwidth 
marketing and trading business similar to its huge natural gas and 
electricity trading operation. 
Excitement among investors about the broadband business and about Enron's 
success in developing a strong Internet-based trading platform for energy and 
other commodities drove an 87 percent rise in the company's share price last 
year, outpacing a gain of 54 percent for the S&P utilities index. 
Kimberly said Enron's bandwidth trading operation is continuing to perform 
strongly, with more than 500 trades carried out in the first quarter, 
exceeding the total for all of 2000. 
Despite the jobs cuts at Enron Broadband, she said, the unit is recruiting to 
fill some other positions.

Subject: UK Submission of Positions

Just to follow up on James's note of yesterday - my apologies for being out

The elimination of the requirement to 'grab' the FX and IR market environment 
from Houston ( and consequently use European data ) can improve our ability 
to kick the overnight batch processing off earlier in the evening. James and 
I will be working with Brian Hudson to determine the timetable for effecting 
this change

The revised batch start time would improve the opportunity to detect any 
system failure and complete a rerun of the valuation process so as to deliver 
completed results by the time the Risk Management team arrive at their desks 
in the morning. System failures are the most significant problem we face in 
delivering timely information to Houston. Consequently the probability of 
meeting current reporting deadlines would be greatly improved given that we 
will have full IT overnight support covering for any IT failure and curve 
input validation processes on trade date.

Indeed given the successful completion of all overnight runs we are able to 
deliver

Officialisation of all valuation systems and most spreadsheets ( David Hardy 
is in final testing of the Eastern spreadsheet feed ) by the 10 AM deadline ( 
Houston 4 AM )
Flash p&l by the 1PM deadline ( Houston 7AM )
Completion of the final DPR to be submitted to Houston by the 5 PM deadline ( 
Houston 11AM )

James and I are currently finalising a document reviewing all possible 
changes to business processes that could improve these times. This is in 
addition to working with Commercial and IT to assess the possibility of 
delivering significantly faster revaluation systems that could assist in 
delivering a trade date control process.

I can confirm that there is significant work to do in this area, however, we 
are dedicated to meeting the objectives of improved/more real time control. 
Please feel free to call if the above requires any additional commentary.

Regards

Mike

Rick,

Thanks you for your note below. We are today implementing a flash P&L 
process. We aim to report daily numbers at 7am Houston time and will start 
today with the P&L. We will build on this and hope to have draft positions 
and VAR for most books within a week or so. There will be a reconciliation of 
flash to final numbers which will be included in our return to Houston. 
 
I will put together a note on the London DPR production process which goes 
into the process we currently have, the process we actually need to have, and 
the obstacles that are in the way. I would expect this to be finalised 
tomorrow. Obtaining the USD interest rate curve on a more timely basis is 
just one of our problems but it is unfortunately by no means our only or most 
serious problem.

James

Need your help on the following: Each day we are delayed in finalising var, 
p&L and positions because the UK must wait for a USD  interest rate curves 
before submitting their data to Houston. I am also told that it is really not 
necessary to wait for this curve and the data could be submitted close of 
business London. Even if there was some minor inaccuracy from this method it 
would be better than what we have now. This would greatly improve the 
efficiency (by 4 to 6 hours) in reporting to senior management. Can you guys 
initiate this change or get me to the right person there. Thanks, Rick

"We have adjusted Suemar in Sitara.  And will probably adjust it again in a

Subject: Suemar Berryman; Gulf Plains Plant for Current Month

Daren,

As you know, we have experienced some fluctuations at the Berryman well for 
OCT, which in turn affects our volumes at the Gulf Plains Plant.  From a 
physical standpoint, I think that we are fairly well balanced.  My concern is 
that we are ""overproduced"" on paper by 76,162 Dth/Mo.   I think that we need 
to bring the nominations up to balance in Sitara at the Berryman well and, a 
corresponding volume at Meters 708 and 6363, with an offset on Strangers to 
keep the physical side in line.  If my understanding is correct (and if not, 
please correct me) this should have a positive impact on our current month 
UA4.

Thank you,

Mary

thanks for the voicemail.

We should definitely get together next week. Your assistant can coordinate 
this through mine - Tracy Foy on 44 207 783 7374.

If you are able to speak to the trading lawyers on lessons learnt from 
California, that would be great. Again, Tracy can coordinate.

I attach an org chart showing the lawyers in the group, for your info. Let us 
know if you want to meet up with anyone in particular. 



Litigation we have on going at the moment:

- ICI warranty litigation: legal: Jon Chapman, commercial: Matthew Scrimshaw

- CATS: legal: Mary Nell Browning, commercial: Peter Crilly

- Metals arbitrations: legal: Paul Johnson, commercial: various.

If you want to meet any particular commercial person, we can also broker that.

I'm in your hands. Let me know.

Subject: Enron Industrial Markets - Super Saturday Recruiting

I need your help!  On Saturday, 01/20/01, EIM is having a Super Saturday to 
recruit experienced Commercial Support personnel to fill many of our 
vacancies.  Unfortunately, we don't have enough personnel to do the 
interviewing.  To round out the Logistics team, I am looking for one more 
interviewer.  The current team is Roy Lipsett, Dan Hamilton and Del Davis.  
Both Dan and Del are new to Enron (Del started 1/8 and Dan is still 
transitioning his prior job and moving to Houston), but bring a wealth of 
Logistics experience for our industries.  I would love to have one additional 
team member to provide input from the Enron perspective.  Will this candidate 
fit into the expectations of Enron?  Will the candidate compete when compared 
to their peers.  Unfortunately, Logistics candidates below Manager have been 
difficult to find from the industry.  There seems to be a tendancy towards 
clerical skill sets but compensation at a Specialist level.  Consequently, I 
have been cautious around these candidates as I would not want to set them up 
to fail.

I know the sacrifice of a Saturday, but I would value the input that any one 
of you might offer.  We do expect it to be a full day commitment as we have 
several candidates, and we will have a follow-up evaluation session.  I know 
I can't adequately compensate you for your day, but I would be happy to buy 
you a dinner for two.  Please let me know ASAP.  Assuming worst case that noe 
of you are available, I would welcome other suggestions.

In advance, I appreciate your help.

I received a call from Carr Futures this morning.  Their parent, Cr?dit Agricole Indosuez, is requesting a parent guanantee to continue trading with Enron North America Corp. and Enron Capital and Trade Resources International.

I spoke with Gary this morning and he said that we could stop trading with them.  I said that others do trade with Carr.  He suggested then that the energy guys can proceed if they wish to continue trading with Carr.

Rick Farina, 312-441-4420, called me with Larry Anderson and Patty Chambers.

How do you want to proceed?

Subject: Spreadsheet database for purchase

Hi Mark, as per our discussion earlier today, here is the contract that KMI 
wants us to sign.  Please review as soon as you can.  As I mentioned in our 
discussion, I am heading up the EBS research group reporting to Vince 
Kaminski and Stinson Gibner (MDand VP of Enron Global Research, 
respectively).  Vince has asked me to talk you directly on matter such as 
this rather than using EBS service since we will be performing much of the 
work stationed out of Enron Corp and the database itself and any resulting 
analysis will reside in Research.

I took a quick look at the contract and already found some things that seems 
too restrictive.  For example, the following clause may need to be removed 
unless you think it would not affect us:

Fourth paragraph:  "" (ii) that you are in a business that does not include 
the operating of an online exchange or auction for bandwidth""  

Strictly speaking, we are NOT in the business of online exchange or auction 
for bandwidth (since that is how we differentiate our market-making activity 
from other online exchange players such as Band-x and Rate exchange), our 
trading activity can be loosely defined as such in an very immature trading 
market such as the current status of telecom market.  What do you think?  I 
would like to set up a meeting with you to discuss EBS and our role and how 
this database will be used, etc... Please have your assistant call Kristy 
Carnes to set up this meeting this week.

I thank you very much for offering to take a look at this at such a short 
notice.



Regards,

Ravi.

We have a bid on the 91,674 MLMG shares held in account # 102-25786-USD-27 at Bear Stearns.
.
Paul Voigt from Jefferies (00 1 203 708 5800) showed us a bid of $2.25 several days ago. The bid now
may be $1.50 only due to size of the holding & illiquidity in the name.

We've discussed selling this position with Mike Breughel & Alexander Sheers at Bear Stearns, and 
Alexander has asked for you to talk to Bears directly.

Can you call Alex & ask if one of the Bears prime brokers can contact Jefferies to execute the trade,
and also to arrange for the proceeds to be paid back to our Citibank account in London.

Subject:	Thoughts on PX Credit Claim with Edison

Chris:
A little background (recaps briefly what we discussed on the phone on Monday):
A few weeks ago, we (government affairs) approached John Fielder of Edison to see if there was any chance that Edison might be willing to reach a deal on our Negative CTC/PX credit claim.
After discussions with RAC, we offered to take 90 cents on the dollar for amounts owed through March 1. (There's general agreement with Edison on what the number is up to January 17, which would only leave 1.17--3.1 in dispute.  But recall there's still the FERC refund issue which complicates the issue.) 
We asked for 10% down immediately and a binding agreement that Edison would pay us by a date certain sometime in the next quarter.  
In exchange, we said we'd drop our law suits at the PUC. In one suit, we're asking the PUC to have Edison pay us. In the other, we've stopped paying Edison for transportation costs until the PUC gets Edison to pay us.  We're depositing what we owe Edison in an escrow account pending resolution.
We also agreed to work with Edison to get the PUC to end the whole residual CTC/PX credit framework retroactive to March 1, 2001.  (That would reduce Edison's exposure to negative CTC and our exposure to positive CTC.)
For his part, Fielder was looking (in addition) for 1) an agreement on our part to forebear, and 2) an agreement that everyone, including DA customers, should pay what they rightly owe for a) Edison's undercollection, b) the bonds, and c) DWR's stranded contract costs.
We never resumed the talks in earnest because soon after our talk, Edison struck its bailout deal with the PUC. 

With respect to what else we could offer them:
From a commercial standpoint, I'm sure you're scouring that front, and I may not have much to add.  But given the credit risk associated with the utility and Edison's other subs, devising a commercial option to help settle the negative CTC claim seems like a challenge.
One possible avenue might be the $250 MM in hedging activity the PUC agreed to in its bailout settlement with Edison.  Edison is authorized to hedge its generation and QF fuel costs for up to $250 MM under the settlement. (But this would expose us to PUC regulatory risk, in addition to Edison's credit risk.)
Another commercial angle might be Mission Energy, but again, not sure how much better Mission fares from a credit perspective.
One idea that we've bounced around that might appeal to Edison--but may or may not be appealing to us--us is to agree to take a note from Edison.  That is, in return for 100 cents on the dollar, we'd agree to take, for example, a 3-year note at some agreed to coupon.  
This should appeal to Edison since 1) it takes us off the list of folks who might take them in, 2) it might provide a useful template that Edison could use with other creditors, and 3) it lessens the overall financing Edison needs to arrange (bridge loan, etc.) in the near-term to pay its creditors.
The ""note"" angle could be packaged up with the other regulatory issues explored in the first call with Fielder.

Hope this helps.

Best,
Jeff

Dear Ms. Gandy:

Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to visit the Owen
Graduate School of Management at Vanderbilt on January 23-24 for on-campus
interviews for the Summer Associate positions at Enron. It was a pleasure
talking with you, and I hope I conveyed to you how excited I am about the
prospect of applying my skills at Enron.

I realize that Enron offers a limited number of positions and greatly
respect your choice of Summer Associates. I would like to ask you if there
is any opportunity for me to work at Enron during this summer for free. I am
confident that my sincere interest in derivatives will allow me to greatly
contribute to Enron during this summer. I am particularly interested in
Enron Research Group. (I had a phone interview with Mr. Gibner on January
31st, and I sent him email yesterday asking for the opportunity to work for
free during this summer).

I am looking forward to hearing from you. If I can provide more information
or answer additional questions, please feel free to contact me either by
telephone (615-496-1132) or via e-mail
(Dmitri.Villevald@owen2002.vanderbilt.edu). Also, I am always ready to fly
to Houston for additional interviews.

Again, thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Dmitri Villevald

"Michael Tribolet:

In response to your question, yes, Edison did file in federal district court 
in L.A.  The filing asks the judge to force the CPUC to 1) declare that the 
rate free is over and 2) raise rates to compensate Edison for its 
undercollections.  (Recall that this filing comes on the heels of the court 
agreeing to hear Edison's case asserting that the CPUC must let Edison pass 
through the power purchase costs to customers.)

The filing is apparently very large.  The lawyers at the CPUC have a copy but 
said that it's much too large to make a copy and aren't willing to give it to 
us to make a copy for ourselves.

Question to the lawyers:  Do we have contacts in L.A. that can go to the 
courthouse and get a copy of the filing for us?  Probably a good idea to have 
that filing passed around to this distribution list.

We have a bid on the 91,674 MLMG shares held in account # 102-25786-USD-27 at Bear Stearns.
.
Paul Voigt from Jefferies (00 1 203 708 5800) showed us a bid of $2.25 several days ago. The bid now
may be $1.50 only due to size of the holding & illiquidity in the name.

We've discussed selling this position with Mike Breughel & Alexander Sheers at Bear Stearns, and

Can you call Alex & ask if one of the Bears prime brokers can contact Jefferies to execute the trade,
and also to arrange for the proceeds to be paid back to our Citibank account in London.

Thanks for your note.  This definitely falls into the ""(b)"" category.  The 
problem is that there are sooooo many things in the b pile already that I 
can't tell you exactly when this will be resolved.  

Having said that, I agree that the weather information is probably the least 
risky, but it might be helpful if you were to visit their sites and see if 
there is any comment about further use of the information posted there.  As 
for the others, a little additional information would be helpful.  For 
instance, I know we were in discussions with NGTL at one time and were 
unwilling to sign the letter they asked for.  Was there ever any follow-up 
with them on that?  Is there any correspondence at all (it doesn't have to 
look like an official contract).  Is the Telerate information also available 
from other sources?  Is it possible that Telerate gets it out really fast and 
that is their advantage but others are right behind with the same or very 
similar information?  Do we have an agreement of any kind with Telerate 
regarding the services they provide to us?

Thanks for your help and continuing attention to this - I agree we should be 
trying to do this the ""right"" way.

Subject: Legal Issues with EnronOnline Newsticker


	

Dear Mark (back from South America?)

I received this email from Donna Greif.  It explains the sources for her data 
which she puts on EnronOnline every day.  As best I know, Mark, we don't have 
any agreement with any of these people for content that we place online.

I'm not too concerned about the weather (it's from the Canadian and American 
governments) but I am concerned about the NGTL data and the data we get from 
Telerate.

We have a disclaimer Online for the NGTL data, saying that it's our 
reproduction and not a representation of what they have on their own site 
(their own site which can be accessed through a password only!), but I think 
this proves, rather than refutes, the fact that we're redistributing their 
data without a right to do so.  The same applies for Telerate--we don't even 
give them recognition--we just post their numbers on our site.

I know you're a busy man, and I'm sure you're dealing with things like 
lawsuits against Enron by South American governments, or something like that, 
but this issue should (a) be dropped, because you believe that it's really 
not that important or (b) resolved, becuase you think it is.

Please tell me how I can help, or if we should let this issue drop.  If I 
don't hear from you, I'll assume that you don't think it's an important issue.

Thanks

Subject: Re: EnronOnline Newsticker  

Jay,

In your original email (attached below), you requested my source of US Nat 
Gas Stats that are posted as a newsticker item on the website.   Please note, 
I would have been more than happy to provide you with source details on the 
Canadian Weather Forecasts and NGTL Pipeline Data if it was part of your 
original request.

US Natural Gas Statistics (Gas in Storage & Cumulative Heating Degree Days)
 * My source is the Producer Newsletter distributed by the Mid-Marketing 
Department (Ross Prevatt & Dan Diamond
    are both part of that team).  For your convenience, I've attached a copy 
for your records
 * The Producer Newsletter is distributed on a weekly basis (Monday nights or 
Tuesday morning)
     and is faxed.  
        - the Mid-Marketing Department gets those numbers from several 
different sources.
        - I called Ross again today to re-verify.  He confirmed the following 
for me:
  * Gas Storage data comes from a direct feed from Telerate.
  * Lucy Oritz passes on the cumulative heating degree days to Ross.
       > Her source is National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration
       > web address = http://www.crh.noaa.gov/grr/wfolocat.htm
     - Should you require any additional details and need to make contact 
with Ross again.....
       I did take the liberty of explaining who you are, the group you 
represent as well as
       why you were needing this information.  I am sure he will be fully 
receptive and understand
       the nature of your question should you need to contact him again.  

Canadian Weather Forecasts (4 day forecast for 5 cities)
NGTL Pipeline Data (Prior day deliveries, etc.)
 * Candace Spencer & Terri Brian in Enron Canada's office pull this 
information from two different sources.  
 * They pull this information together, and fax updates us each morning.
     - NGTL Pipeline Data is pulled from 
http://www.nrgexpressway.com/ngtl/index.htm
  * You must have a password to gain access to this information.
     - Canadian Weather Forecast data is pulled from 
http://weather.ec.gc.ca/alberta_e.shtml
  * Upon reaching the site, you would select the appropriate City.
  * Once in the city, scroll down to get the weather forecast data.

My apologies for any mis-communications on your original request.  Feel free 
to call me if you are in need of more 
details (x3-9517).

Thanks,

dg


P.S.  Currently, Noel Petterson is updating the website.  His back-up is Matt 
Motsinger.   In additions (just an FYI), this
will be my last week with the EnronOnline team.   Please forward any future 
requests to Frank Davis.

Subject: EnronOnline Newsticker

Following our exchange of emails two weeks ago, I spoke with Ross (whom you 
suggested), but he didn't know of you & didn't think that anything he 
produced was sent to you.  He suggested that I contact Dan Diamond, who wrote 
back saying that he didn't know anything either but that I should contact 
Rahil Jafry.  The only problem of course is that I work with Rahil, and I'm 
trying to find this information in response to a discussion that I had with 
him!

So, could you tell me exactly where you get your information from, for the 
following items:

Canadian Weather Forecasts (4 day forecast for 5 cities)
NGTL Pipeline Data (Prior day deliveries, etc.)
US Natural Gas Stastics (Gas in Storage & Cumulative Heating Degree Days)

Even if you don't know the specific source, if you could tell me how you get 
the information, then I'll try to follow it up.  So, for example, 'Each day 
at 6am I receive a fax from 713.853.2297 with a list of numbers.  I take 
these numbers and put them in the Canadian ...'

Sorry to keep bothering you, but this is a potentially serious issue for 
us--we need to know exactly where we're getting our content from, and no one 
seems to know!  So anything that you can do to help would be appreciated 
greatly.

Thanks in advance

The EnronOnline team gets those numbers from the weekly Newsletter 
distributed the ENA Commercial Team.   Ross Prevatt is the individual who
actually puts the information together.

In talking with Ross this morning, that information is taken from a Telerate 
feed  (the Telerate feeder gets the info from daily/weekly/monthly 
publications).  Ross did not give me the specific companies that publish the 
information.  Feel free to call Ross directly if you need additional 
information.

Dear Donna

(Following the voicemail that I left for you on Friday)  I was wondering if 
you could tell me whether or not the US Gas Storage data & the cumulative 
CDD/HDD data are taken from inside Enron only?  (I'm asking because Paul 
Goddard has encouraged me to update our letters of consent for content that 
we carry on the website.)

Many thanks,

Both,

Thanks for your comments and comparisons, it is good to get context.

Based on your comments here would be my proposal

o63,500 basic salary - 
o15K kickers for each of the 2 years - These are paid as a lump sum on each 
anniversary guaranteed.  Therefore guaranteed salary is effectively o78,500 - 
this is completely separate and in addition to any performance bonus
Increase the value of options to o60K  to vest 1/3 as before - which leaves a 
1/3 ($20,000 ) hanging out there at the end of the contract.  

Just FYI - Anjam is currently on o68,000 but does not have an agreement, so 
this would effectively put a 10.5K gap between the two.  

Let me know your thoughts.

Sophie,

Here's Vince's comments on your proposal for Steve.  Also, what's a 2-Yr 
Exec?  How do the kickers work - are they basically a guaranteed minimum 
bonus or incremental bonus?

Dale,

Thanks for your message.
I don't know the labor market  in London that well but here the market
for quants is very hot.  Steve is in my view an exceptionally talented person
and I would go an extra mile to retain  him long-term for the company.

I would adjust the base salary or the kicker upward a bit.
o62,000 Basic  is what Anjam is receiving currently  (if I remember 
correctly). Steve has a much higher value
to Enron than Anjam.

Thanks for the memo and we should discuss in a future meeting dedicated to

If we adopt the 2000 Definitions in our Schedule, we will also need to change 
the existing reference in Part 6(f)(iii) to ""Negotiated Fallback"" (to Section 
7.5(c)(iv))

Also, the term ""Relevant Price"" is used in the ""Negotiated Fallback"" 
definition. We should clarify whether we need to retain Part 6(f)(iv) of the

Reference Dealers"" be an entirely separate and distinct fallback (i.e. the

Thanks for your comments.  A new draft should be out shortly that addresses

Jeff:
Just a few comments:

1.   In the definition of termination Event, I think that the words ""due
to""
need to be put after the word ""means"" in the first line.

2.   In Section 3.4(a), I noticed that the bracketed langugae ""as it
relates to
the Assigned Interest"" has now been deleted.  Pursuant to my earlier
comment on
this, what this maens to me is that with respect to the Fixed Payment
piece of
this, we can never terminate the swap based on something that happens to
Pelican
.  Is that the way it is supposed to work?  If so, plaese explain why.

3.   With respect to the lnagugae in Section 3.6(a), instead of saying
in the
first sentence of such Section ""the amount determined..."" shouldn't it
say ""the
fair market value of Party A's remaining payment obligations under the
Transaction"".  Section 2(x) of the confirm just refers to Disputed
Matters and
it is not claer to me what is in dispute when an Event of Default or
Termination
Event occurs and what amount Party A has to pay when these events occur.
What
is the priocedure for coming up with this amount?  Does each party
calculate it
and then send it to the experts or do the experts just determine it?

"I have reviewed Tana's list of North American utilities and have the 
following comments:

(1)  I have tried to eliminate all governmentals and regulated entities.  
However, I suggest that we ask Kevin Leitao to take a quick review for 
obvious errors.  (However, I don't want Kevin to prepare unlimited research 
on our behalf.  I'll discuss with him).

(2)  I suggest that we ask Canadian counsel to review Canadian utilities on 
authority/regulatory issues.  In my experience, Canadian outside counsel was 
reluctant to even comment on utilities located in provinces other than 
outside counsel's domicile.

(3)  The online omnibus does not contain the ISDA Section 3(c) rep as to 
absence of litigation.  This rep drags in governmental bodies and all 
agencies (hence, a state PUC).  Thus, online parties will rep as to authority 
to transact each time they trade but we will not know about potential PUC 
issues.  (Under the ISDA, a party would have to notifiy us of a ""Regulatory 
Development"" and we may have an Event of Default for failure to notify; we 
may also have a Termination Event under our current format)."

Here's an amazing factoid in today's paper related to the issue of how much 
money you can ""make"" (sic) by hedging:

...

Other companies analysts say are saddled with hedges include El Paso Energy 
Corp. and Coastal Corp., which are merging. 

A Coastal official declined to comment on the company's forward positions. 

Although El Paso is known for its pipeline business, it produces gas as 
result of its $6.2 billion acquisition last year of Sonat. ""More than 90 
percent"" of that gas is hedged through the rest of the year, said Bruce 
Connery, vice president of investor relations. The forward contracts are for 
$2.40, he said. 

Hedging in the current market plays to the company's primary aim of meeting 
investors' expectations, Connery said. 

""Our first goal is to deliver the earnings goal that we set out, and that 
dictates that we hedge out commodity volatility,"" he said. 


...

$2.40??? Are you kidding????

The receipt points are Exxon-Chalkley, NGPL, and Tenn-Egan.   The delivery

"John and Molly:
I have reviewed the ISDA Master that we have with Range Resources and here is 
a summary of the steps that need to be taken assuming that we have already 
notified them that they needed to post collateral: 

1. An Event of Default occurs upon their failure to post collateral within 2 
Business Days after notice of such failure is given to them by us.  

2. Once an Event of Default occurs, then we can elect an early Termination 
Date.  The ""Loss: method applies here.  As I mentioned in my voice mail, we 
need to coordinate closely with whoever will be doing the Loss calculation 
(and it should not be Fred or someone in his group) to make sure that they 
have the appropriate back up.  We would send a notice declaring an Early 
Termination Date once the Event of Default had occurred and then subsequently 
provide them with our calculation of the Termination Amount.

As I mentioned in my voice mail message, I need copies of all of the letters 
that we have sent to them along with copies of the confirmations of all 
outstanding trades.

All notices will need to be sent by federal express delivery such that they 
won't be effective until the day after they have been sent out."

"Hey guys,

PSA's are a hot topic, and I have a call into Lisa Bills to discuss it.  Lisa 
has been out of town for a few days, as has the GF TurboPark lawyer, Rose 
Engeldorf.  Rose is being seconded to ENA for TurboPark issues, and will be 
back in the office tomorrow.  We should sit down with Rose and puzzle through 
the issue.  

As for the ""standard"" EECC form PSA, it is a real bear.  Carlos has recently 
worked on a TurboPark/97-10 compliant form, and is waiting for Global Finance 
blessing.  He was going to talk to Bart about his experience, which could 
also add some extra insight.

When you guys have some time it is probably worth taking a half hour to 
discuss it.

Right, Renee. We don't want to do sonething that might inadvertently bust any 
eventual off-balance sheet treatment that might apply. 

Hey, Ann. FYI, our usual form of PSA and Tasking Letter didn't fit these off 
balance structures on Mr. Clark's Ft. Pierce job. There was something of a 
controversy as a result and they had to be re-worked. We don't want to go 
there again.

Kay, Ann, and Steve, do you know if  this project is to be Turbo-Parked and 
if so is the work  that you need the PSA and TL hard cost or soft cost? If 
it's to be Turbo Parked, let's work from the  forms Bart developed for Ft. 
Pierce. Renee, please copy Ann on each draft you turn out, including before 
you launch to the other side. 

I am out of the office this week,but checking e-mail and voice mail about 
once a day.  Please leat a voice mail for me at 713-646-6309 if you need me.

John,

I have received the following request for a PSA and Tasking Letter between 
ENA and EDSA from Steve Rose.  I want to make sure that the Deerfield 
Project, part of the Florida Greenfield Projects, is not being done through 
Off-Balance Sheet Financing, as this would preclude us from using the PSA 
form of contract.  To this end, I am copying Ann Elizabeth White, the ENA 
attorney on the Florida Greenfield Projects.

Once it is determined whether a PSA and Tasking Letter is acceptable for the 
work, I will proceed accordingly.  

If the Florida Greenfields are being financed through Turbo Park, I believe 
Bart Clark has a Turbo Park form for the landscape artitecture firm being 
used on the Ft. Pierce Project and I could try getting a copy of that from 
him.

Thanks

Broward County, FL

Renee,

I let you a voice mail message about this on Friday.  We have up until now 
been using the landscape architecture firm of Curtis-Rogers, working under a 
subcontract with Parsons Brinckerhoff, on the Deerfield Beach and South Dade 
sites.  Steve Krimsky has decided that he wants to use EDSA (another 
landscape architecture firm we've used on Pompano Beach) to complete the 
landscaping design work on Deerfield Beach, and to have them work directly 
for ENA rather than as a sub to PB.  I've already discussed this at length 
with Doug Smith, one of the principals at EDSA, and have e-mailed him a large 
quantity of design information and got EDSA kicked off to do the work.  Doug 
is supposed to send me a summary of EDSA's NTE costs for the tasks I 
identified to him, which I will forward to you as soon as I get it.

EDSA is now working on the Deerfield Beach landscaping on the basis of my 
conversation and e-mail, and their preliminary deliverables are due Friday 
March 16 (i.e., the end of this week).  We need to get a PSA and TL set up 
between ENA and EDSA to formalize this arrangement.  I would like you to 
draft these two documents ASAP so that we can get the proper contract 
documents in place as quickly as possible.

I will forward to you via separate e-mails the various documentation you will 
need to help put this together.

I'm working at home today (typical ENA vacation day!), so you can reach me on 
my cell or at home if you want to talk about this.

My numbers are:

Cell:  713-854-4971
Home:  281-655-0185

Thanks in advance for your help with this task.

Regards,

Steve

looking for addtional people.  More importantly, Goldman moved one of its top 
traders worldwide, Tom Montag, from London to Tokyo and is generally beefing 
up the resources in Japan.  IBJ has contacted me about energy trading and 
asked for copies of confirms and says there is growing interest in the market

Hi there --- Had lunch with Mo today  -- so as you can imagine she was very 
interested in my new role, working with you.  Fernley has decided that it is 
too hard to write down all of the organizational changes and how it affects 
all of the people who reported in to Phillip and I, so he has just verbally 
announced the changes.  But, at any rate, the word is getting out.

I hadn't seen Mo in months, so it was good to catch up.  I think she is 
headed to Houston this week (so is Frank) so I am sure you will be hearing 
from her.


I have tentatively blocked out the week beginning Monday, Nov. 13th to come 
over to Houston, and would like to spend some of that time with you and your 
team, meeting people, and maybe just following you around for the day, as you 
suggested.

Does that week work for you?  I think the Management conference is later in 
the month, so people will generally be around.


Please let me know, and I will make sure it happens.  I will also need to 
spend some time with Melissa Becker and her team working on Post ASE 
Reporting solutions, but will plan to spend a significant amount of time with 
the North America group.


What do you think?  I am ready to get moving on some new things!!!!

Folks-
Ok, here is the plan. We need to draft language on the following issues
(including all the options under each of the issues) that were included in
our Roadmap Document:

Direct Access
Large Customer Utility Service options
Rate Relief
Customer Specific Generation
Renewable Energy

These are the pieces that are NOT covered in other plans, documents, etc. We
need to have the language completed no later than Monday 7/9 at 5:00pm.

I am open to suggestions on how best to handle the work -- maybe assigning
the topics above to folks and then getting together to refine and finalize a
work product? If everyone thinks this is a plan that can work and if there
is a specific topic you would like to tackle please let me know. I would
propose meeting on Sunday at say 3:00 at Mike Kahl's office if that meets
with everyone's approval.


Thanks,
Delaney

Subject: Notice to Global Counterparty

I spoke to Mark Dilworth about our discussion re: Global Counterparty being 
notified via e-mail whenever a customer 'signs' an ETA or GTC. Mark seems to 
think that this methodology is rather difficult, and the liklihood of it 
being accomplished anytime soon is LOW.

There is a report that will be generated with each days trading that will 
identify who our Active customers are (meaning a User ID and Password has 
been issued). That report will give us that day's exposure; exposure meaning 
there was activity for that customer, for that day; no exposure meaning there 
was no activity for that customer, for that day. With activity we would know 
that an ETA had been signed, and then you could go in and see that the GTC 
had been signed off (should be simple, as the GTC would match the Product 
Type being traded). This report would identify new customers as they traded, 
but would not identify those customers that sign an ETA and do not do any 
trades.

Mark has agreed that our idea is certainly do-able for Phase 2.

2. Yana is not a member of the Analyst/Associate pool. THIS IS NOT A ROTATION.

Lee  - I agree with your statement that LV needs the PSS.  But not with 
regards to Delta.  I do not know what Delta needs for siting their 
generation.  It is my understanding that generators in the WSCC need PSS's.  
I am trying to locate chapter and verse on that requirement.  It may be a 
size issue (ie - greater than ""x"" MWs of generator size). Don Hammond will 
help me locate the requirement in the morning, and I will get back to you.  
My concern was your e mails seemed to imply I said Delta doesn't need PSS. I 
want to stay silent on that issue.

In any regard, Nevada Power Co requires PSS, that is the reason we are 
obtaining them for all the generators at LVCII.

Kent/Kay-

I've redline the Salmon contract for Exhibits A and B, Purchase Amount,
Maximum Liability Amount, and Unit Liability Amount.  The Power System
Stabilizer has been struck from scope, because I can recall Bill Williams
advising that LV would need them, Delta/Salmon would not.  That's consitent
with the other units going to CA (w/ Intergen).

"Hi Carolyn,

In addition to my comments regarding the definitions, here are some other 
thoughts:

Letter agreement:

I would bracket [Spawn], since we don't have it formed yet and we probably 
haven't checked on availability.  

2. Closing date should be at least five but no more than 10 business days.  2 
(a)  Facility Agreement is probably the more appropriate concept than Turbine 
Contract.  Not a big issue if anyone disagrees with this terminology.

3. Make the guaranty for this agreement and the LLC agreement. 

5 (d)  change 1st ""shall"" to ""'may"".

7 (b) does this make sense?  Should we also have the right to specific 
performance?

9.  (iii) consents won't necessarily be obtained at the time of the signing 
of the letter agreement.  Should say by closing such will have been 
obtained.  I haven't done a reg evaluation, so I would delete the reg rep 
unless you are comfortable.  I want the HSR risk to be with them, so I don't 
want to contradict it with the rep.

I'll review the LLC agreement next.

The Dunn Committee will be taking up the contempt citations again on Tuesday, 
July 10.  We are currently contemplating two actions.   First, we intend to 
offer to produce some documents, most notably the ISO bid data sought (which 
the Committee already has anyway).  Secondly, as we do not expect this 
voluntary partial production to placate the Committee, we are preparing an 
action to file in federal court in Sacramento on Monday challenging the 
subpoena to the extent it seeks to require the production of documents other 
than those we offered to produce.  Robin Gibbs and Mike Kirby are on board 
with this.  Please let me know if would like any additional information about

Tim,

I hope things are going well in Resco.  I think somebody from Resco (or 
Research) may be interested in the email I received below from Brad Davids.  
Brad is now working at Abacus who works with residential customer patterns as 
well as predictive modelling.  He's going to be here the 25 and 26 of this 
month.  I'm not sure who is responsible for Resco Marketing, but I think they 
would find this interesting.  Who should I send this to?   Please let me know 
if anybody in Resco may have any interest.

Thanks,

Subject: RE: Possible Meeting?


Steve:

I'll see if I can get in on the 25th . . . will let you know, but I think
it'll work.

Just to give you a very brief overview so you can think about who might be
interested, Abacus has the largest transactional database of consumer buying
behavior in the world (89 million US households, 3 billion+ purchases),
along with sophisticated modeling capabilities to help predict customer
response to various offers at the household level. Given the critical need
to reduce customer acquisition costs in retail energy markets, we believe
that our data and modeling can help energy retailers target their direct
marketing efforts toward the residential customers most likely to respond to
whatever the offer is--improving the efficiency of mailings and other
promotional campaigns (so there is an efficiency angle, see!)

Because our data allow the modeling of future buying behavior based on
actual purchases, our results tend to be significantly more predictive than
demographic-based models. So far, the the response from utilities and ""new
entrants"" I've been talking to so far has been quite positive, and we have
some tests of our data underway, but we're interested in talking to as many
players in the market as possible as we develop specific products to meet
utility needs.

I can provide more background if desired to whoever might be interested, but
I guess the key immediate question is whether it might be worthwhile to
arrange a short meeting sometime on the 25th of April with whoever at Enron
might have interest in hearing what we're up to, and (most importantly)
listening to what your data needs might be as you enter new markets.

Thanks very much for any help . . . I look forward to catching up and
hearing how things are going for you.

"Some thoughts --

1. We argue against the PJM Installed Capacity obligation.  Basically it is 
another rent capture system for generators.  

2. Don't really understand your stranded cost recovery scheme.  Looks like a 
transmission level charge.  Is it $/mw or $/mwh?  

3. Your model for a pool doesn't solve the key problem of market power.  
Putting a pool in place w/o dealing w/ market power is a recipe for disaster.

4. You don't talk about ""Market Based Rate"" authority.  Would all generators, 
including incumbent generation be allowed to bid their price or must they bid 
cost?  This is critical.  This is the real carrot to get the Utilities off of 
the stick - mandatory participation with cost-based bidding for Incumbents 
until under 1,000 (?) HHI.

Good luck,

Jim

Subject: Recommendations for Japanese Electricity Reform

Please find attached the latest draft of the Brattle Group's recommendations 
for the Japanese power industry and the accompanying appendices.

You will find changes in emphasis and structure, which make the paper more 
convincing, comprehensive and readable. We have tried to include a global 
view of market objectives in keeping with your approach in Houston, to give 
better explanations of why our recommendations are right for Japan at this 
stage and to address potential objections from deregulation's critics in 
Japan.

In addition to its earlier content, the new draft:

includes a new section setting up the objectives of a competitive market and 
defining a workably competitive market, before making specific 
recommendations to achieve those objectives in Japan;

addresses objections by utilities, etc. in Japan to our proposals. Current 
opinions or issues circulating in Japan include: California crisis, 
discrediting of a tight pool, success of PJM ensured by lack of requirement 
to unbundle, nuclear power development;

emphasizes the need for a strong, independent regulator given METI's recent 
inability to provide clear rules to support its recommendations and lack of 
expertise in the Fair Trade Commission;

de-emphasizes final section on public policy issues to emphasize market 
structure, by merging the public policy issues into one section, placing 
reliability at the top of the list and providing alternatives to achieve 
nuclear policy issues;

proposes implementation timetable in keeping with Japanese review process;

takes a punchier, more urgent approach in the executive summary and the paper 
as a whole.

The paper will be published as a Brattle Group paper commissioned by Enron 
Japan. Much input has been provided by Enron Japan but the economic arguments 
and general approach are in keeping with Brattle's written positions and 
standards. The written style of the paper is, of course, theirs.

We would appreciate any comments you might have on the contents of this 
paper. Since we will release the paper on 15 May and will create completed 
published versions in both English and Japanese by 11 May, please send us any 
comments by the end of this week, i.e. Friday, 4 May.

Could we set up a conference call in the next day or two to go over the data
requests, establish a responsible party for putting together the information
for each question, and set a time frame for getting it in?  I am tied up
most of Thursday afternoon, but am generally available the rest of the week.

I thought I'd e:mail the revised data requests upon receipt;  if I haven't
heard from Gisele by this afternoon, I will fax them.  :Let me know if you
are interested in receiving copies of the local government resolutions.
There are no surprises; they simply adopted and signed what I drafted
without even retyping them.

Great idea - here's our latest ISDA schedule (note the changes to law, 
process agent, notices, tax reps, etc)

If you work with Ian, that would be grand

be a good time for you to go.  We can meet there and then go to dinner.
Or,
you could come by my place and get a look again and help me pick out the

My only comment to this is to please make sure the contracts have IMNE and 
IMME as desks since most of them will be market area deliveries.  They are
already in Unify and the multiple desks may be all we need to path them.  The 
Transco schedulers are also going to have to know the receipt and delivery

other things.

"I am not completely convinced that our attendence would be constructive.  
First, I assume that we can enter testimony into the docket without being a 
witness at this hearing.  Second, the way the hearing has two groups (a) good 
guys with facts finding the guilty and (b) the apologists for the guilty 
makes it difficult for me to know which panel I would recommend that we 
join.   Our message doesn't seek to find blame just solutions.  Finally, 
given the upcoming FERC hearing, why not make our case in that process where 
I think the witch hunt mentality won't be so high?

I can be persuaded otherwise on this case.   Either way, however, my 
assumption is that we need to work toward getting FERC informed and ready to 
do the right thing and manage the CPUC and other CA issues to do no harm.

Subject: Re: Comments on Wholesale Issues  

I spoke w/ Bill Julian, Cmmr. Wood's Advisor, about the hearing that is being 
held on Friday, September 8 in San Diego.  There will be a morning panel and 
an afternoon panel.  The morning panel will discuss ""pricing 
behavior/patterns"" and the afternoon panel will provide 
explanations/refutations of the morning presentations.  I'm not sure yet who 
will be speaking, but I have inquired from Steve Weisman, who appears to be 
heading this effort.  

Do we want an Enron representative on the panel?  Who would be the best 
witness?

While this investigation has the opportunity to turn into a witch hunt, I am 
also concerned about the record being developed in such a way as to lead to 
the conclusion that Wood, or the legislature, have in mind.  This could mean 
an attempt by the Commission to assert more regulation in the market, assert 
more state (vs. federal) jurisdiction, build a case for collapsing the ISO/PX 
into one organization, or hang blame on generators and scheduling 
coordinators.

I think Tim and Mary's presentation would be very effective in showing the 
other (real) side of the story.

The following is an exerpt from the pre-hearing conference transcript held on 
8/28 from Cmmr Wood:

27               I am not going to sit here and say that it's not 

           28    an appropriate time to assign blame.  If there has been 

            1    wrongdoing, we will assign blame.  We will ferret out the 

            2    wrongdoers, and we will bring them to account to the 

            3    greatest of our ability. 

            4               But I think that, as Judge Wetzell pointed out, 

            5    the scope of this proceeding is quite broad.  We are not 

            6    only addressing the immediate issues, but we are also 

            7    addressing the underlying problems of this market which 

            8    clearly is not functioning, which clearly is broken. 

            9               We have to look at problems with the structure of 

           10    the market, we have to look at problems with the behavior of 

           11    market participants; and getting beyond the wholesale 

           12    market, we have to look at the interaction with the retail 

           13    market because, after all, that's where the pain actually 

           14    occurs.  That's what consumers themselves face.

           15               There are probably implications for the long-term 

           16    viability of California's utilities that are connected with 

           17    this proceeding, and we have to get into that.  And for that 

           18    reason, as well as the fact that the other utilities in 

           19    California are going to be coming out of the rate freeze at 

           20    some point in the future, we have to consider the statewide 

           21    implications of what we're doing. 

           22               So this is not just the San Diego proceeding, 

           23    although we are focused on events here in the San Diego 

           24    area.

Subject: Comments on Wholesale Issues

Wood, the Assigned Commissioner in the investigation of wholesale electric 
markets, has asked for comments on the following questions by Friday, 
September 8.  We are an individual party to the case as well as a member of 
ARM and WPTF.  

This would be a good opportunity to get our version of what is wrong on the 
record.  The presentation that Tim and Mary put together for FERC will be 
helpful in answering these questions.  I will take a first cut at drafting 
response to be circulated by Tuesday of next week.  We can take liberties in 
providing responses that go beyond the question asked.

Market Structure:

Are the market conditions currently being experienced (price spikes and suppy 
shortages) inevitable under the current market structure?
Do generators and/or scheduling coordinators have market power?
Is there a need to mitigate such market power?
Which market participants or other entities are responsible for reliability 
planning?
Do California regulatory agencies have adequate jurisdiction to ensure 
reasonable prices and reliable service?
Do the structures and governance of the Cal ISO and PX adequately support the 
goals of providing reasonably priced and reliable service?

Market Rules:

Are there rules which allow or encourage unacceptable market outcomes?
What roles, if any, do underscheduling in forward markets, out of state 
transfers, uniform PX auction prices and ISO real-time and out-of-market 
purchases play in the outcomes being experienced?

Behavior of Market Participants:

What is working and not working in terms of price, reliability, information 
exchange, resource distribution, equity, service quality, and types of 
planned generation?

"Folks:

We're getting down to the wire.  The Legislature has failed to come up with a solution.  The Treasuer (Angelides) has been marketing the bond issuance.  The key component of his sales pitch to investors is his guarantee that the PUC will suspend DA at its August 23rd meeting, period.  Loretta's in a box with few options other than suspension.  

Attached is a proposal that Sue and I pulled together yesterday (all defects, errors, lapses of judgment, etc., included in the proposal are mine, not Sue's).  It's got two options:

Option A
Cap DA at the net short position for the next 12 months on a first-come-first-serve basis.  ""New"" DA customers would pay fixed charges for 1) utility past debt and 2) the bonds to cover DWR purchases from Jan to present.  ""New"" DA customers would be exempt from DWR long-term charges, however.  ""Old"" DA customers would be exempt from everything.  Absent legislation addressing DA, PUC would revisit in 12 months.

Option B
No cap on DA eligibility.  However, ""New"" DA customers would pay fixed charges for 1) utility past debt, 2) the bonds to cover DWR purchases from Jan to present, and 3) above-market costs of DWR contracts. ""Old"" DA customers would be exempt from everything.  Absent legislation addressing DA, PUC would revisit in 12 months.

Clearly, these are not ""first best"" DA constructs.  But the situation we face is arguably binary----DA suspended altogether, or a significantly compromised DA market, but a market, nonetheless.

Tomorrow is a meeting of the Direct Access Coaltion, where Sue and I intend to present the options and attempt to get ""everyone"" on board.  If successful, we would file the proposal (as a very large coaltion) with the PUC on Friday, accompanied by a noisy press release.

Please review and determine if there are defects in the options that would prevent us from going forward.

We'd like to discuss further on today's 1:30 (CDT) California call.

Best,
Jeff

Right now, I am booked at 47 Park for next week.  I would love to be closer 
to the office, but I don't know if there is anything that makes sense.  Any 
suggestions?  If not something close to the office, would you suggest another 
spot besides 47 Park?  

I am committed to working on my agenda for next week before I leave the

Check the PUC website for information---it sounds like the PUC's inquiry into 
the adequacy of SoCal's insfrastructure, i.e., in state transportation.  
Should be a lot about it on their website (www.cpuc.ca.gov).  If you come up 
empty, leave me a voicemail (415.782.7822) and I'll track things down.

All I know is as follows    On March 27,2001 the Commission issued a scoping 
memo in 00-11-002.  The scoping memo added the issue of the adequacy of 
SoCal's transmission system to the issues to be addressed in this proceeding.

An ALJ ruling dated April 26,2001, provided that the adequacy of SoCal's gas 
transmission system and the effect on its customers be bifurcated from the 
other issues in this proceeding.  The ALJ's ruling provided that any party 
filing testimony on March 23,2001 would be allowed to file supplemental 
testimony on the SoCal capacity issue.

SoCal filed supplemental testimony.

We are not a party. We need to know if it is too late to become a party, if 
we wanted to. Also was any other supplemental testimony filed by other 
parties??

Dear Dan and Gary,

     Given the FERC order for refunds from the power producers, I think
that the time has come for a serious paper critiquing the underlying
analyses and explaining market fundamentals.  Analytic errors are a
prominent feature of the Cal ISO ""Report"" on supply costs (February 28,
2001), and I would be surprised if the same were not true of the FERC
order and any supporting analyses that may have been prepared.  (Dan is
sending me a couple of relevant FERC documents now, but I will not be
able to review them in detail until Tuesday or Wednesday.)  In general,
however, it is fair to say that a common set of analytic errors
underlies such bureaucratic thinking, and the dangers inherent in the
ISO and FERC orders suggest that a detailed refutation is something that
ought to be done.  The central points that I believe I would make
include the following, among others.  (I'm using a small amount of
economic jargon here that I would not use in a report, but I really am
quite experienced at making such arguments in plain English.)

    1. Such analyses typically are incomplete, in that they ignore (a) a
risk premium for non- or under- or late payment.  They ignore also (b)
the fact that part of the marginal cost of selling today is the forgone
opportunity to sell tomorrow, given that units have to be taken down for
maintenance and the like.  In this sense, electricity can be ""stored"" in
the form of dispatch availability, and it is in the interest of
consumers for suppliers to produce when supplies are needed the most,
i.e., when (expected) prices are highest.  This is true even during a
stage 3 alert: Suppose, for example, that even greater problems are
foreseen for the ensuing summer.  Accordingly, this is not
""manipulation.""  In addition, as explained in my paper in the current
issue of Regulation, (c) market prices under competition include a price
premium for the provision of optimal reliability.  These three
components of cost are important, with measurement requiring econometric
and other tools; and they perhaps are impossible to ""verify"" in
regulatory methodology.

    2. The ISO and FERC analyses confuse marginal and (average) variable
cost, average and marginal producers, average and marginal units of
production, etc.  Other errors are likely as well: The ISO, and, I
suspect, FERC implicitly assume away rising input prices as demand
conditions increase.  This would yield in perfectly competitive markets
a supply curve steeper and a market price higher than measured ""marginal
cost.""  Moreover, the ISO, and, again, FERC in all probability,
implicitly assume perfectly elastic supply at whatever input ""costs""
happen to prevail.  That is simply incorrect: In the short run,
production capacity is limited, so that even if input prices do not rise
with demand, there is a ""kink"" in the competitive supply curve.  If
demand intersects supply above the kink=02=05that is, if the amount demande=
d
exceeds production capacity at the ""marginal cost"" that the regulators
measure=02=05price will exceed that ""marginal cost.""  Think about the
wholesale market for wheat, for example, which is close to a perfectly
competitive market.  In the face of bad weather in some agricultural
regions, the market price of wheat will rise, even though ""costs"" for
the remaining wheat farmers=02=05labor, insecticide, land rents, fuel, wate=
r,
etc.=02=05will not have changed, and indeed might actually fall because of
reduced demand from farmers affected by the adverse weather.

     3. The ISO report admits explicitly that it does not know market
marginal cost, because it complains that some suppliers bidding above
the ""soft cap"" have not submitted cost data.  Moreover, marginal cost
properly defined is for the market as a whole, rather than just for the
producers who bid in California.  This means, quite literally, even
apart from all of the other problems, that the conclusion of
""uncompetitiveness"" or ""unreasonableness"" cannot follow from the ISO
analysis or from what is likely to be the underlying FERC analysis,
because price will equal the marginal cost (defined correctly) of the
last unit produced in a competitive market.  In short: The sort of
analysis offered by the ISO and FERC cannot even in principle determine
competitive prices because the regulators lack data for marginal cost
for the marginal producer.

     4. The implicit definition of consumer welfare (""wellbeing"") used
by most regulators is incorrect.  Consumers are interested not in low
electricity prices alone, but in a maximization of the value of the
entire consumption basket.  Average electricity prices lower than
marginal cost reduce consumer welfare by engendering resource use in the
electricity sector that is too big, and thus prices in other sectors
that are too high.  Moreover, price controls of whatever form must
create shortages even in markets with inelastic demand, and the true
price with a shortage is unambiguously higher than the price that would
clear the market in the absence of the controls.  (Think about the
""cost"" of electricity during a blackout.)  This is easy to demonstrate
analytically.
     The ISO and FERC clearly are shunting aside the effects of price
controls masquerading as ""refunds"" upon long run expectations and other
parameters, which easily can be shown to make consumers worse off over
time.  Part of this problem is the creation of an asymmetric
distribution of expected returns, since suppliers clearly will not be
subsidized when prices are low.

     5. The ISO errs in its assumption that bids above the soft cap
reflect higher capital costs.  I would not be surprised if FERC is
making a similar error.  Capital costs, having been sunk, cannot affect
short run pricing; the differing engineering efficiencies of generating
units will be reflected in their market values, and thus the opportunity
cost of production.  This means, in a strict textbook sense, that
different generating units cannot have costs that differ, as
counterintuitive as that sounds.  More efficient units will have lower
fuel costs (for example), but higher opportunity costs for employment of
the capital assets.  I would make this point in a report, simply to
erode the credibility of the regulators, but I would not push it too
hard, since some people cannot understand it.

     6. The Report ignores the market power of the respective regulatory
bodies as monopsonists under the implicit system of price controls and
refunds.

     7. The definition of ""market power"" is entirely obscure, except
implicitly as bids higher than marginal cost as measured by the
regulators.  This is incorrect, and I think that this needs to be
explained clearly.



     I am sure that other errors and omissions will emerge as the
relevant documents and arguments are reviewed.  Anyway, I'd like to
prepare such a report.  I would have to see precisely what it is that
must be refuted, but my guess is that this is about a two-week project
in terms of required analytic and writing time.  An effort to measure
marginal cost correctly would be a good deal more involved and
time-consuming, and my sense is that at this stage a refutation is more
important.  If it is a two-week project, then I think that $15,000 would
be reasonable.

    Looking forward to hearing from you.  Ben

"This provision is an election which we have added to the Schedule for 
governmental entities.  I believe that it is intended to eliminate any 
confusion that historically arose during the debate between ""First Method"" 
(one-way payments) and ""Second Method"" (two-way payments) for Early 
Termination purposes.  Although I can't find a good reason to continue to use 
this provision with an ISDA (except that it emphasizes the point), I can 
understand why we may have added it to a pre-ISDA agreement with a 
governmental.  The only example that I could locate was our September 21, 
1995 Master Agreement with Reedy Creek Improvement District.  For those of 
you who have never seen this form, it was one of the two types of master 
agreements developed by ECT before we became conversant with ISDA.  Because 
these forms didn't contemplate municipal counterparties, we had to add many 
of the ISDA U.S. Municipal Counterparty Schedule provisions.  The Part 
5(b)(k) provision originally appeared in this early agreement.  It was 
included in the ""Event of Change"" section [5F(4)] (which is tantamount to the 
ISDA concept of ""Illegality"", a ""Termination Event"").  I think it was 
probably included because in the ISDA, Second Method is the automatic payment 
method if the parties fail to make a specific designation for Early 
Termination purposes, but there isn't a comparable provision in the old ECT 
form.

Michelle,

A few months ago, TW Marketing and Fac. Planning had a meeting to discuss TW CAS system issues. At this meeting, you indicated that the TW Marketers would like to have some training on CAS. I have discussed with Perry Frazier & he would like to set up 30 minute one on one hands-on training sessions with each individual. 

Can you coordinate with your team & identify a list of TW Marketer's who would like to have CAS training? I will work with Perry to schedule the training times.

Thanks Ramona"

I may have mispoke - I thought you were talking about the power contracts.  I 
don't think the current gas form permits assignements in connection w 
financings, but I could be wrong. let me know what else I can do."
"Just checked with Richmond Hill Inn in Asheville and they are open over 
Thanksgiving.  Not filled yet for that time period.  They are sending me a 
brochure.  Only potential draw back there is that most of their rooms have 
only king size beds and sleep two persons.  There are 2 rooms that have two 
beds, and two cottages that have sleeper sofas.  They do have baby beds.  
Families of 2 or 3 can be accomodated fine.  I would probably take two rooms, 
one for the girls and one for Tyler, David and me.  But we would probably do 
that in New York or San Francisco, too.  As we all know, five is almost too 
many in one room and bathroom.  

I think that dinner in Austin on June 2 and a trip at Thanksgiving sounds 
like a good plan.  Do you guys want to cover that with Mom and Dad and ask 
about the San Antonio/Sun City crowd?

Hello, Sista -

Sally and I spoke this morning (I know you guys spoke last night as well) -
and here's the latest idea:

Since August, Sept., and Oct.  are pretty much impossible for a trip, how
about we schedule a trip - possibly to NYC or San Fran. - during
THanksgiving.  This seems ideal since we always get together anyway at that
time - and nobody will have to remove kids from school.  Sally thinks maybe
we could travel Tuesday - Saturday and avoid some of the Thanksgiving travel
MADNESS.  Also, it pushes the travel even further into the year, which may
help you.

Then, we can have a family dinner for Mom and Dad on June 2 somewhere in
Austin.  We can include Maryann and Fabe and San Antonio cousins IF mom and
dad would like that.

Thoughts?   -Cara

"John,

This is a resume I received today from  my friend.
Please, take a look at it. What follows below is a copy of his message to
me:


Dear Vincent,

I very much would like to ask you for a career advice. I am looking for new
challenges and new professional opportunities. Possibly there would be such
opportunity around yourself  at Enron Corporation.

I trust that my strongest asset is my intellectual capital and ability to
look from new angles into complex issues. Beside of the experience of
working under Jacob Goldfield an Paul Jacobson at Goldman on the interest
rate swaps and proprietary desks, I was a part of research effort of John
Meriwether group at Salomon Brothers, I headed the European interest options
desk at DKBI in London and I have managed a small hedge fund in partnership
with Albert Friedberg.

 I hold Ph.D. in mathematics from MIT and I have studied under Nobel
Laureate in Economics, Bob Merton.

I very much would like to apply my knowledge of capital markets, trading and
research in the field of energy markets.

With my very best regards and personal wishes,

Hi Elyse:
I work in government affairs in San Francisco.  Dave Parquet (VP, Western Origination) has been approached by a California state legislator to participate in a golf tournament, the proceeds of which will go to a children's charity (Dave, correct me if I got it wrong).  The legislator is someone who has been and will likely continue to be supportive of Dave's on-going commercial activities and Dave would like to participate.  I've been informed that this could fall under the sorts of activities that community affairs has resources for.  Is that right?  Thanks for the help.

Raymond James Energy Stat of the Week, published 3/25/2002.

With the recent surge in U.S. natural gas prices many analysts are
scratching their heads in disbelief. Of course there will continue to be
volatility, but we believe these higher gas prices are not only
sustainable, but will likely move up through the summer (similar to what
happened in 2000). For the past two months it has become very evident that
U.S. natural gas supply/demand on a weather-adjusted basis is much tighter
than the same time last year. The market has finally begun to realize the
extent of this tightness, as more ""normal"" weather over the past several
weeks has removed a substantial amount of the natural gas storage overhang.
This shift in supply/demand should become even more evident as we move into
the early part of the injection season in April/May. Look for summer gas
injections to be down 30% to 50% from last year's numbers. This should be
the bullish driver of summer natural gas prices.

Next week, we should have even more bullish gas news, as the preliminary
numbers from our first quarter U.S. E&P production survey are likely to
surprise many on the Street. Stay tuned....

the over all position before the move was 1,240 and as of yesterday it is 4,205.

Let me know what the concerns are at EDF MAN and the request that they are making.
We can shift some positions around if the have levels by months that they want us to stay under.

Hi, Jeff --

It was great to meet you this week while you were in San Diego for the
hearings.  Cathy Van Way and I had a blast catching up on old times and
trying to think of every pun possible that led directly back to electricity.

I know Enron has extensive communications support, but in the future if you
have need on a project or public relations campaign, I hope you'll keep me
in mind.  Although it took me a while to understand the difference between
a megawatt and a megaphone before Rep. Schaefer introduced the first bill,
once I finally ""got it"" I developed an ability to help the media understand
the issue -- so that misinformation, as experienced in San Diego -- can be
avoided.   I've also maintained excellent contacts with the media covering
electricity and can help with corporate pr as well as issue communications.

As you're well aware, the light won't go out on this issue for a long time
(pun practice).

Best regards,

Dana

Sorry if you get this impression. The real reason is that I treat
the lunch meetings as an opportunity to get updates on things
that are going on at more remote locations. I interact with each of the
members of your group daily and I know what's going on.

I agree with you, however, that the lunch meetings are not exclusively

Vince and Stinson,

The valuation group has accomplished a lot during last six months.  The 
number of
projects we are working on is keeping increasing.   However, when comes to the
staff meeting (Thursday lunch meeting), we are often left out for updating 
our projects.
This makes me feel that what we are doing is no longer interesting or worth 
mentioning.

I am hoping that we can get  more exposure, despite we are still in the old 
economy.

Paul,

Thanks for your e-mail.  Parenthetically, I'd be happy to explain how we got 
to where we are on our strategy; maybe a telephone call would be best.  Let 
me know when you are available.  I can call you early a.m. or late p.m.  

Re the bug issue:  we were aware of this, although I am interested to hear 
that SGS raised it with you and Eric in mid-October.  I have discussed this 
in the past with David Best, and spoke with him on the telephone this morning 
about what SGS told you.  We don't think we should put anyone on notice about 
the bug issue unless and until it appears and is confirmed at the joint 
testing.  Otherwise, we may be raising an inherent vice argument for both 
Mitsubishi and our own cargo underwriters.   Let me know if you have a 
different view (on this or anything else I put in this e-mail). 

Re Mitsubishi's response to our settlement demand:  David Best has just 
spoken with Sian Heard, Mitsubishi's lead London solicitor.  It is clear from 
her that Mitsubishi will not be settling prior to instituting arbitration.  
It is also clear that Mitsubishi will not consider any substantial settlement 
without Heard's advice.  Best believes that Heard will recommend that the 
joint testing take place before giving Mitsubishi an exposure evaluation.  In 
sum, while our attempt at settlement prior to joint testing was a worthwhile 
effort, to avoid the risk and expense of the problematic joint survey, it now 
appears to David and me to be at a dead end.

Re the joint testing:  Again, David and I believe that the joint testing 
should proceed as quickly as it can be arranged.  Neither our cargo 
underwriters nor Mitsubishi will move off dead center unless we do so.  Given 
the problems with SGS's lab in Singapore, the ""bug"" issue that SGS in Subic 
Bay has raised (again), and that SGS did the pre-purchase of product for ECT 
that proved off-spec, I have asked David to re-visit with Steve Jones, our 
chemist, the logistics and cost of having the testing done in the U.K.  I 
have also asked him to consider whether Heard might be amenable to splitting 
the costs of transporting the samples from Singapore to the U.K.  I would 
like to get ECT's authority quickly to authorize the joint testing to go 
forward.

Re the selection of arbitrators:  David has discussed three Q.C.s that he and 
Neale agreed were appropriate with Hearn.  Of those three, Hearn likes 
Nicholas Hamblin, who will charge 275 pounds an hour, and $1,750 pounds per 
day.  She will be conferring with Mitsubishi about using him as the sole 
arbitrator.  Given that we have initiated a good-faith discussion of the 
choice of arbitrators with Mitsubishi, David advises that we do not need to 
worry about sending Mitsubishi a letter tomorrow with our choices of 
arbitrator on it.  We can wait for Hearn to respond, then I will make a 
formal request for your authority to agree to one arbitrator who has already 
been accepted by Mitsubishi.

Re the without-prejudice settlement of Mitsubishi's freight and demurrage:  I 
read you loud and clear (and thanks for making clear that the freight claim 
is only about $500,000, not $760,000, as I had inadvertantly indicated in my 
last e-mail).  As I previously mentioned, David and I are on board with this 
idea, given the difficult circumstances of this case.

Let me know if I have inadvertantly mischaracterized anything you said.

Britt

britt,

thanks your reply which is noted. you will notice i have excluded david best 
and ngregson (?) preferring to keep my comments in house as privileged info, 
unless you feel this msg should be forwarded to them later.

firstly, i am getting nowhere with mitsubishi on the settlement front. i have 
gone so far as to mention this morning to mitsuru that if this does goes to 
arbitration, and should mitsubishi succeed in their position, this will only 
serve to increase our claim by a similar amount since these costs would then 
become part of our contamination claim. he seems quite content to let this go 
to arbitration. as an example, he was suppose to call me back this afternoon 
but did not.

secondly, with regards to your comments, i would just respond/add the 
following information:

1. i don't know if i am switching tactics so much as following what should 
have been done in the beginning (i.e. submit the claim to our insurance 
company and let them proceed against the owners). i honestly feel the 
arbitrators will say, ""pay the freight (and possibly the demurrage now) and 
settle the contamination claim as a separate issue"". clearly, the c/p says 
that freight is due without deduction once the vessel has completed discharge.

on the issue of the ""pre-sale"" survey, i have discussed this matter 
internally with eric tan. seems our position is that singapore considered the 
sample that was drawn as a bad sample as well as we were not sure that the 
test methods used conformed with the testing methods required for first gas. 
this position is proved by the loading of the pacific virgo when the product 
subsequently tested on-spec for first gas. granted, it might still become an 
issue but, as you say. it could become an issue in either proceeding.

i am getting a little confused on the matter of the joint testing. verbally i 
was advised that enron did not want to have the joint testing - at least not 
on a prompt basis. your msg now says that we do want to test the product and 
it should be done as soon as possible (as mitsubishi - and your advices that 
the underwriters and hear owner's p and i club would want). i assume this 
change is the result of the arbitration. 

be that as it may, i do have a bit of information that you may, or may not, 
be aware of or find relevant. when eric tan and i visited first gas in 
mid-oct to meet the personnel at first gas and witness one of the cargoes 
being discharged at the plant, we also took the opportunity to meet with sgs 
in subic bay to see their facilities and meet their personnel. during the 
conversation the subject of the elang cargo came up and the comment from sgs 
is that they were fairly certain it was off-spec due to ""bugs"". this may 
sound silly but i have heard of this before and is a problem with petroleum 
products.

it seems sgs even went so far as to test the product themselves for these 
""bugs"" and got a positive result. this test was not requested by enron or 
first gas and was done some time later in this process. i understand there 
may be some concern on our part over our subsequent sales to third parties if 
we knew there were bugs in the product. i would have to say that this was not 
known at the time and even today is only conjecture based on sgs' advices 
mid-oct (well after these sales). sgs also described ""changes"" to the product 
which would fit with the cargo having bugs (i.e. a strong sulphur smell and 
change in colour).

if the testing is now done, i do not know if these bugs will be detected or 
not. however, if they are in the ship's samples, they may have changed the 
sample sufficiently that even a visual observation may detect the problem. 
the next problem becomes proving from where the bugs originated. were they in 
the previous cargo tanks that were not cleaned properly? or were they in the 
condensate when the cargo was loaded? obviously, testing of the shore sample 
prior to loading will determine the answer. if the shore sample is ok, then 
they had to come from the ship. if the shore sample also has bugs, then we 
should be claiming against our suppliers.

this of course assumes the suggestion put forth by sgs is in fact correct. 
just something else to be considered.

2) i am not saying that we pay the full amount immediately but only the 
freight portion (about $500,000). we then advise mitsubishi (or their 
lawyers) that we will now review the demurrage claim (about $260,000) and 
revert by say end nov. the demurrage claim has been sent to our london 
office's demurrage department and i have asked them for their comments on the 
claim. after all, there may be issues with the ship's pumping performance or 
simple laytime errors which may reduce the demurrage claim. they will try to 
get me a response before the weekend.

in this manner, we pay part of the money but still have a smaller portion 
which we may apply against our claim once the test results are known. i will 
leave this to legal as to decide how the approach to mitsubishi or their 
lawyers should be made

"Good draft.  Few comments:

As much as we may not like it, the commission is where the action is right now, and we're going to have to work with them.  As such, I think the comments would be significantly more effective if you go through the document and edit out the invective and other highly charged adjectives, which, while therapeutic, tend to incent the Commission to ignore or be even more hostile to our interests. In short, I don't see an upside to it and there is downside.  Rather than try to edit, I've simply compiled those paragraphs that in my view should be deleted or require serious toning-down. In addition to these specific areas, I would recommend going through the document and toning it down generally.
Seems that it would be useful, up front and at the end, to give OUR answer (maybe I'm repeating Jim's comments here):  e.g., The Commission should 1) not do retroactive, 2) permit customers to do what the contracts permit (e.g., add facilities, renew, etc.), 3) hold hearings on all of Wood's unsubstantiated assertions, and 4) anything else we want to be part of the solution as it relates to the issues raised by Karl.
On page 2, do we run the risk of affirming  what Angelides and others are saying, i.e., that DA could bankrupt the state?  Sure we need to say it, since it seems to play into their spin and everyone already knows of the bind they're in?  Could backfire.
Point # 6 on page 14:  are  we inviting the Commission to ask parties to submit contracts?  Possible to re-write or eliminate this so that it doesn't appear we're advocating having folks submit them?

Good job.  Thanks for your efforts.  Seems that the key thing is to let the Commission know unequivocally that it must hold extensive hearings on the many factual issues in dispute.

Best,
Jeff

The advocacy ad blitz has started.  I don't know if I have the title correct, 
but the D.C. based arm of the Democratic National Committee has started an ad 
campaign against Republicans (in San Diego I believe).  The head of the 
committee was quoted this morning as saying something to the effect of, ""the 
Republicans in Washington aren't doing anything to solve the problem and ""we"" 
want to make sure that they're held accountable.""

Best,
Jeff

Sarah, 

As I have not yet heard from Jayshree, I thought I would convey the gist of our phone conversation by e-mail.  

Over the last several days, we in the research group have looked at ORACLE risk management databases and Enrononline data to corroborate the profitability numbers for power and gas trading.  Our analyses yield figures which are substantially at variance with what is normally believed to be the case.  Of course, there may well be information sources we are not privy to.  Moreover, we found some irregularities in the data which only serve to raise our doubts about the quality of the data.

As a result, we are not able to make an authoritative statement about the profitability of power and gas units. As we are not able to intepret the data ourselves, we have provided the spreadsheets so you can draw your own conclusions.  Thanks.

"HEADLINE: Davis faces dire political consequences if power woes linger

BYLINE: By Daniel Borenstein

BODY:

??WALNUT CREEK, Calif. _ As Democrats prepare for their first statewide
convention since the electricity crisis erupted, some elected officials and
strategists are warning of dire political consequences if Gov. Gray Davis 
fails
to clean up the power mess.

??""All of us should be thinking about the effect the energy crisis is going to
have on our chances of maintaining control of both houses, and the effect the
governor will have on the ticket up and down,"" said state Sen. Don Perata,
D-Alameda. ""If he has not performed well and he has a D after his name, that
could be problematic.""

??Garry South, the governor's top political strategist, said Thursday that the
state's electricity woes probably won't be over soon, but the voters 
understand
Davis didn't create the problem.

??""It won't be solved in six months,"" South said. ""This is an immediate 
problem
that is not susceptible to an immediate solution. This is a several-year 
process
to get this situation back under control.""

??As for the governor's critics, ""I think they should be asked to produce 
their
own plan. It's awful easy to take pot shots, but most of those who I read 
about
in the newspapers have no plan.""

??The intraparty sniping on the eve of the party convention highlights the
frustration Democrats are feeling about the crisis_and its potential political
damage.

??Four months ago, this weekend's convention in Anaheim seemed certain to be a
Davis fete. Although Democrats had lost the presidency, Al Gore easily carried
California and the party was in firm control of the Legislature and the 
state's
congressional delegation.

??Davis had led the Gore effort in California and the governor was personally
and politically popular across the state. This would have been the convention
for him to showcase his achievements for education, the issue he had promised 
to
make the hallmark of his first term.

??But electricity now overshadows everything else. To be sure, the governor
will tout his policy achievements during a Saturday morning speech to the
convention delegates. And he is not shying away from the spotlight.

??Tonight, he will host a party for the delegates at Disney's California
Adventure Theme Park. That prompted one Democratic consultant from Sacramento
who won't be attending to quip, ""We're in fantasy land here, thank you. We 
don't
need to go to Disneyland for that.""

??Some are shaking their heads in disbelief at how the governor has handled 
the
events of the past week. ""In many ways, he appears to have gone politically 
tone
deaf,"" said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, political analyst at Claremont Graduate
University. ""His instincts are not serving him well.""

??While his top aides were meeting with legislators last week to warn them 
that
a $10 billion bond package won't be enough to get the state out of the crisis,
Davis was at a $10,000-per-person Palm Springs golf tournament to raise money
for his re-election campaign.

??When his hand-picked members of the Public Utilities Commission this week
approved an electricity rate hike that experts have been predicting for 
months,
Davis claimed that he didn't know about the plan before it was announced and
that he thought it was premature.

??Other Democrats, however, thought the commission action was overdue. ""I'm
glad to see the PUC stepping out and doing something along the lines that some
of us have been talking about needing to be done for the last six or eight
weeks,"" said state Sen. Tom Torlakson, D-Antioch. ""There's a high level of
frustration. There haven't been clear answers to what the solution is.""

??South, the Davis political strategist, said a lot of factors are outside the
governor's control. ""No one can predict with any certainty where this is going
to go, and no one can predict when this situation is going to be brought under
control. We don't control the generators, we don't control the FERC (Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission), we don't control what Wall Street is going to
do.""

??As for the potential political fallout, South said the governor and 
Democrats
remain in a strong position. After all, he said, the deregulation plan was
pushed through by a Republican governor and Republicans in Washington are
blocking efforts to cap prices.

??Jack Pitney, government professor at Claremont McKenna College, predicted
Davis could weather the electricity crisis. ""People who are following it know
it's roots run deeper than the Davis administration and the Republicans don't
have any plausible alternatives,"" he said.

??""My read of public opinion is people don't think there's a simple and easy
solution and they're not expecting one. They may be impatient but they won't
necessarily take it out on (Davis).""

??It's too early to predict the political outcome, said Mark Baldassare,
pollster at the Public Policy Institute of California.

??""The impacts won't be clear until people have gone through a few billing
cycles and we've gone through the summer blackouts, until we see what the
personal impacts are so we know what the political impacts are,"" he said.
""That's the really crucial period for Gray Davis' political future, after this
summer.""

"
"Here are my observations:

I agree with Rusty re: the put option complicating things for us.  Second, 
there has to be an absolute end to this agreement at some point. If we want 
to have an automatic extension by commencing construction, there still needs 
to be a date certain after which we can go forward without them no matter 
what.  In other words, if we want to add the language Rusty suggested, it 
should be limited to x months after the expiration of the option agreement.  
We'll need to run this back through Accounting.

I really don't like the inclusion of the language in paragraph 5. If we add 
the language requested in paragraph 5, we need to run this agreement back 
through Accounting, and we may need to add some other additional language.  

I don't know if Rusty and Fred think we may need a zoning change for this 
parcel.

Subject: Fehr Option Agreement

I am in receipt of the Fehr's comments to our option agreement.  In reviewing 
them, I have the following comments:

The paragraph (2) change that says they can compel us to buy their land upon 
a Triggering Event occurring is not going to work, because this is a put 
option on their part which hurts our hard cost avoidance issues.  We 
carefully reworded previous put option language to avoid this.    Also, how 
can we be bound to a deal when the agreement has expired ?  I think we would 
need to say that ""if we decide to build the plant after the option period 
expires, then that would serve to extend the term of this agreement, however, 
if the option agreement expires unexercised for a one year period then we 
won't be bound to the deal.  

If the provisions of his comment (5) are indeed parallel to another similar 
paragraph in the document I don't have a problem with it, but ""specific 
performance"" scares me in general.  Your (collective) call.


Lets wrap this one up fast.  I want to resolve it soon so I can use it as 
leverage with Ledford and not have him influence them.  He picked a good to 
go on vacation, but is back in on Monday.  I also told the Fehr's that if we 
could do this before the 15th I would go for $185,000 vs. $175,000.  Since we 
were about five days longer than promised, I can justify the delay to end of 
next week, but I don't want them to think I was just blowing smoke on the 
extra $10,000.


Fred :  Refresh my memory on who I need to go to for the option payment check 
?

"Per my conversation with Edmund this morning, we are moving Germany to the 
approved list for trading credit derivatives.  Below is the list, now updated 
to reflect this change.

European jurisdictions which are are approved for trading credit 
derivatives:  Finland, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the U.K..

The European jurisdictions which are not approved to trade credit derivatives 
include:  France, Gibraltar, Ireland, Italy, Scotland, Spain, and The 
Netherlands.   For banks incorporated in a non-approved jurisdiction, it may 
be possible for them to trade out of a branch located in an approved 
jurisdiction (i.e. U.S. and U.K. branches).   This would have to be 
determined on a case by case basis.

Canada is also not an approved jurisdiction for credit derivatives.

Please let me know if there are any changes to this list."

"Here is the form of LLC agreement we used for the Intergen deal, tweaked a 
bit for lessons learned.  I will forward the updated letter agreement which 
has been improved also.  It relates to the Blue Dog turbines, so some of the 
defined terms are different.  I will also forward the Intergen docs so you 
can see some of the definitions, etc.  

One thing which wasn't addressed in the Intergen deal was the potential HSR 
issue (there wasn't one) which arises when the put or call option is 
exercised.  

I also have the TurboPark docs, which I can forward when it gets closer.  I 
don't know if I have the electronic versions of the other closing docs.

We did have a ""form"" LLC agreement in conjunction the letter agreement.  It
was most recently circulated in a Jan 4 e-mail from me and is the attached

provisions of Section 2.5 and depending on whether XYZ is a corporation,

discussed Tennessee Gas Pipeline contracting with the Utility with EES acting 
as their agent for interaction with the Utility.  However, I think it should 
be EES who contracts with the Utility to receive electric service.  TGP has 
contracted with ECS for Compression Services and ECS has contracted with EES 
for power.  TGP has no need for a power deal.  Let me know what you think

"Only couple brief comments on the version that includes Edison's comments:

Under the definition of ""Spot Market Service"" it now reads:

This service is available for Large Customers and Medium Customers whose 
service from a Direct Access provider has been interrupted, or who have 
failed to elect or be deemed to elect either Direct Access, Core Service or 
Term Service. 

I don't understand the meaning of the phrase ""or be deemed to elect.""  If 
inserting the phrase serves an important purpose, then perhaps it's 
appropriate to leave it in.  But we haven't discussed any reason for needing 
it.  As such, given the last-minute nature of the change, it should be 
deleted.

There is one heckuvalot of detail in the rate-related language that Edison 
provided that we didn't have a chance to discuss in our negotiations.  It may 
turn out that it's all fine, but I frankly haven't haven't had the chance to 
adequately wrap my meager mind around the language, so I just want to let 
folks know that many more comments on those pieces may pop up from my end in 
the near term.
Finally, I just want to raise a flag on section 25465 (a) (6) regarding the 
green portfolio standard.  We never discussed/analyzed those additional 
percentages and consequently we never established a ""zone of comfort"" around 
including those numbers.  That may become an issue (and may not, just wanted 
to briefly flag it).

Thanks again for all the effort.

Chris, remember we discussed this on Tuesday aftenoon - When we came in 
Sunday (after physical deals were transfered over to new books) we 
recaculated individual P&L's. Your book which had Friday's P&L of ($2,240) 
was making $131,808 due to physical deals movement. So we had  to tranfer the 
difference of $134,048 from your book to Scott Neal's to bring you back at 
Friday's P&L.  This hit came in your Nymex book in March causing you to lose 
more than you think in Nymex.

On Monday you would have recovered that physical loss but several deals  
Sitara 636796, 636821, 646038 were changed on Monday  resulting in taking the 
Sunday's gain away from your book.  

Let me know if we need to discuss further. thanks.

My NYMX book is a positive $138410.00 with the trade I did today.  This

I still have only 3 physical deals (all desk to desk) in my book, all valued 
at CNG IF flat.  I still don't see how I can have negative P&L of $128,818.

"Andrew  Parsons is currently leading a project to define and quantify the 
costs for several different alternatives for disaster recovery.  We should 
get an update from him to see if there is anything applicable.   There is 
sheer disaster that impacts many companies/locations (which may require one 
approach), and then there is nusance stuff (frozen freeways in Houston, etc.) 
that really requires an updated contact list and set of notification 
procedures.  And then there is system failure and the requisite back up.

Subject: Disaster Recovery / Business Resumption for Commodity Logic

One of the calculated risks ENA has lived with is the potential 
unavailability of systems given a disaster strikes the Houston area such as a 
hurricane that knocks out power, etc.

Have you given any thought on the commodity logic side of providing a 
hot-backup / fail-over capability from another location ?  This could be 
particularly critical with the Contract Exchange module and might be one 
assurance customers would want before signing up.

For that matter, is there a market in providing disaster recovery / 
hot-backup capability to companies in high-risk areas?  It has traditionally 
been thought of as too expensive to warrant implementing such a capability 
for our own purposes.  Perhaps there are economies of scale that can be 
recognized when providing this capability for many.

I propose accelerating Steve's move to head the Research group here.  It

a tangible reward along with his performance feedback.

Vince - I agree with your conclusion here.  We are still trying to fill 
Dale's structuring role as well so part of the question is 
how we announce Steve's lead research role relative to when we know who will 
take Dale's spot.  Perhaps we should just
move forward with the Steve announcement the day that Dale moves full time to 
EBS.  I will ask Richard Lewis to take the lead
in working with you on finalizing the decision and communcicating the changes 
to the organization.

But I do want to reinforce how pleased we are to have Steve here.  He is a 
wonderfull asset to our efforts.

Subject: London Research Group

John,

I am writing to you regarding the management of the London Research group.

As you know, Dale Surbey, who was managing the London unit of the Research 
Group,
is moving to EBS. Dale did a terrific job helping me to develop the pool of 
talent we have currently
in London.
Given that Dale is likely to be transfered to Houston,  it's time
to nominate one member of the Research Group for a management position.


My recommendation is Steve Leppard. Steve emerged not only as the most
technically qualified member of the group  but also as a natural leader, 
highly
respected by his peers and internal customers.  Steve has a very high energy 
level
and is very efficient as a manager and as  coach of new talent.

His promotion is likely to cause Anjam's departure form Enron. I value 
technical
skills of Anjam, but in spite of my loyalty to him, don't think he is the 
same caliber
as Steve. However, I would not like to lose him and think about moving him to 
Houston
for 2 years. I think that the opportunity to work in Houston, would be a 
sufficient
incentive to keep him in Enron. By the way, his performance feedback has 
greatly improved.

Please, let me know what you think.

Vince

Subject:	Timing for QF meeting with Edison

Jeff - I believe we currently on scheduled for a September 13th conference call with John Fielder to discuss QF proposals.  One of the concerns I have is that the timing is such that it is unlikely, given the legislative session end of September 15th(??), that we are going to get much traction.  (Aside from the fact that it seems difficult to convey the nuances of this deal over a conference call).  It may not be relevant in this environment, but this idea makes sense.  It is an issue of who will listen and who will act.  It seems to make sense to propose the structure to DWR.  Given the dilemma of how to marry both the Utilities' revenue requirement with that of DWRs on a go forward basis, anything that proposes to lower a portion of either of these revenue demands should be addressed.  

The proposal to DWR could go as follows:  Either  Edison and PG&E could separately participate in the dual auction process to buy out the QF agreement and replace with market energy or the contracts could be assigned to DWR and DWR could conduct the dual auction.  Assignment of the contracts to DWR would be contingent on a successful auction process.  A buyout of the high priced QF agreements would provide for added head room under the rate caps and thus provide a basis for the higher cost DWR contracts.  

In addition, it appears for our analysis, the savings would be such that you could roll in the outstanding debt owed to the QFs and not exceed the existing payment to the QF under the current capacity plus SRAC pricing.  As such it seems that it could be construed as a restructuring of contracts and not a BAIL OUT of SCE.  (I say this because my understanding of SB 78 is that a portion of the debt is to pay the back payments owed QFs.  Is this portion of the bill being viewed by the radical contingent as a bail out?)

Let me know your thoughts.

		 Subject: Special Oversight Committee

There will be an oversight subcommittee of the new committee formed to
shape energy policy in the Special Session.  In a meeting today,
Assembly Member Darryl Steinberg, who will Chair the subcommittee, told
us he expects to hold two hearings to ""track the money"" between
utilities, geneators and wholesalers.  He hopes to wait until after the
completion of the PUC audit, unless that audit drags on longer than the
next week or so.  He is planning a ""constructive investigation"" and
pledges to be fair.  The subcommttee will be staffed by the Speakers
Office of Oversight.

Also, Enron has been invited to testify at an informational hearing of
the Assembly Utilities and Commerce Committee on January 16, 2001.  The
general topiic is how supply and demand affect the California market and
what options are available for new or repowered generation in
California.

"The weekend of Dec 15, 16, 17.  Stinson Beach.  Glorious place on the beach.  
Professional blue grass band.  Catered food.  Fun people (even Tom, Karen, 
David, Starr and Nina).   For Prentice's 30th birthday.  And it will just 
suck if you're not there.  Huge hugs, very wet kisses."
"As an introduction:  The referenced counterparty is trying to straighten out 
the online products it wants to trade with us (it's open for some, but not 
all of the products it wants to trade).

When I looked at Profile Manager to see what they had already been approved 
to trade, I noticed that this counterparty was opened to trade many of the 
European products, including specifically European physical power products 
(which is unusual for a US based counterparty to trade).

Before I go in and change the profile for this counterparty, I wanted to 
check with you and see if London had specifically opened them to trade the 
products they were opened to trade (especially physical power).

What I usually do when I am approving US based counterparties, is that with 
respect to Non Us & Canadian products, as long as they are an Eligible Swap 
Participant I open them up for all products except European physical power, 
which I never open them for.  Also, Credit Derivatives, I never open anyone 
up for unless we really mean it.

So, my question to you is did London actively approve the non US & Canadian 
based products (especially physical power).  If you didn't, then I am going 
to take this as an oversight of the pre-approval process and shut them down 
for European physical power.

"For Dec, we were taking 4679 day from the Egan parking into TGT.  Effective 
12/16/2000, we moved the remaining balance to Jan 2001.  I made the following 
adjustments to deal 473190, 
 took daily withdrawal volumes to 0 effective 12/16 - 12/31
 extended the deal to Jan 2001
 changed 1/1/2001 to 2444
 changed 1/2/2001 - 1/31/2001 to 2414

This might be a little confusing because we also have withdrawals of about 
1500 day in Jan.

Also, Egan is showing a different balance than what I have.

I show we should have a total balance of 132,247 (4679 x (31-13)  plus  48025 
)  at the end of gas day 12/13/2000.  Egan is showing a balance of 134,302.  
This just means that we parked more gas than I thought or we cut back on some 
of our withdrawals on the 1st through the 13th.  No big deal, I just want to 
make sure we don't leave any gas in parking."

Today's focus: McVeigh video really a virus

By Jason Meserve (write me at jmeserve@nww.com)

You knew someone would take advantage of the recent execution
of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh to spread a virus.
According to a number of computer security types, a purported
video of the McVeigh execution circulating the 'Net is actually
a virus that drops the SubSeven backdoor onto infected systems.

For those who don't know, SubSeven can be used to take over
control of the infected machine and be used in distributed
denial-of-service attacks. The good news is that most updated
antivirus scanners already detect this virus, so if your
systems are up to date, you should be safe.

For more on this, check out this wire story posted on
DigitalMass.com:
http://digitalmass.boston.com/news/2001/06/14/mcveigh_virus.html


Today's bug patches and security alerts:


* SQL security hole lets attackers take over

A security flaw in Microsoft's SQL Server 7.0 and SQL Server
2000 Gold can allow an attacker to take control of a targeted
server, the company said in a security bulletin late Tuesday
night. Microsoft issued a patch for the flaw at the same time
it released the bulletin.
http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2001/0613sqlhole.html
IDG News Service, 06/13/01

For a patch and more information from Microsoft:
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS01-032.asp


* Microsoft has third go at Exchange hole

Microsoft has issued a third version of a patch intended to
plug a security hole that could allow hackers access to
mailboxes on Exchange Server Versions 5.5 and 2000. The second
patch contained outdated files, Microsoft said in an updated
security bulletin issued Wednesday.
http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2001/0614exchangehole.html
IDG News Service, 06/14/01

For a third try at getting the correct patch, click to:
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS01-030.asp


* HP warns of potential DoS vulnerability in kmmodreg

Hewlett-Packard is warning its HP-UX operating system users of
a potential denial-of-service vulnerability in the kmmodreg
command, which is executed each time the system is booted. The
problem with the package also could be used to increase
privileges on the affected system. HP-UX users can download a
patch for the kmmodreg problem by logging on to HP's IT
Resource Center at:
http://itrc.hp.com


* Xinetd patch released by Linux OS vendors

Many Linux vendors have released a patch for the xinetd package
that fixes a flaw in the way the application deals with TCP
WAIT commands. The problem prevents the linuxconf-web
application from working properly. Another flaw in the xinetd
package creates world-writeable files that can be used in a
symlink attack. Linux-Mandrake users can download the new patch
from:
http://www.linux-mandrake.com/en/ftp.php3

Red Hat users can get more information and links to patches
from:
http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2001-075.html

Immunix OS 7.0-beta and 7.0 users can get the appropriate patch
from:
http://download.immunix.org/ImmunixOS/7.0/updates/RPMS/xinetd-2.1.8.9pre15-2

_imnx.i386.rpm


* Linux-Mandrake patches tcpdump

Linux-Mandrake has issued a patch for its tcpdump package that
fixes a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The flaw could
be used in a remote attack on the tcpdump process. This patch
also fixes a previous vulnerability that could allow a remote
user to run arbitrary code on the affected system without root
privileges. The new patch can be downloaded from:
http://www.linux-mandrake.com/en/ftp.php3


* Linux-Mandrake fixes imap flaw

According to an alert from Linux-Mandrake, several flaws have
been found in the UW-IMAP package that could allow an
authenticated user to gain greater shell command access. This
is particularly problematic for e-mail systems that do not
normally provide shell access. Patches can be downloaded from:
http://www.linux-mandrake.com/en/ftp.php3


* Conectiva patches exim

A printf vulnerability exists in exim, a mail transfer utility.
The flaw in the code deals with the way exim check e-mail
headers without protecting against a printf format attack.
Conectiva users can download the appropriate patch from:
ftp://atualizacoes.conectiva.com.br/6.0/SRPMS/exim-3.16-4U60_1cl.src.rpm
ftp://atualizacoes.conectiva.com.br/6.0/RPMS/exim-3.16-4U60_1cl.i386.rpm
ftp://atualizacoes.conectiva.com.br/6.0/RPMS/exim-doc-3.16-4U60_1cl.i386.rpm

ftp://atualizacoes.conectiva.com.br/6.0/RPMS/exim-mon-3.16-4U60_1cl.i386.rpm



* Red Hat issues patch for ispell

According to an alert from Red Hat, the ispell program uses
mktemp() to open temporary files, which makes it vulnerable to
symlink attacks. For more information and to download a patch:
http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2001-074.html


* GnuPG patch available for Red Hat Linux users

GnuPG, an open source version of PGP, contains a number of
flaws that could leave a user's private key exposed. The
problem is a format string vulnerability in GnuPG's code. For
more information and links to the appropriate download:
http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2001-073.html


* Red Hat: LPRng fails to drop supplemental group membership

According to an alert from Red Hat, LPRng fails to drop
supplemental group membership at init time, though it does
properly setuid and setgid. The result is that LPRng, and its
children, maintain any supplemental groups that the process
starting LPRng had at the time it started LPRng. This is a
security risk. Download the appropriate patch from:

Red Hat Linux 7.0:
alpha:
ftp://updates.redhat.com/7.0/en/os/alpha/LPRng-3.7.4-23.alpha.rpm
i386:
ftp://updates.redhat.com/7.0/en/os/i386/LPRng-3.7.4-23.i386.rpm

Red Hat Linux 7.1:
i386:
ftp://updates.redhat.com/7.1/en/os/i386/LPRng-3.7.4-23.i386.rpm


* ScreamingMedia patches SiteWare vulnerability

A flaw in ScreamingMedia's SiteWare Web server could allow a
user to view all documents in the SiteWare Web hierarchy. A
similar problem could allow any file to be retrieved from the
system. More information and a patch can be found at:
http://www01.screamingmedia.com/en/security/sms1001.php


Today's round up of virus alerts:


* Simpsons worm hits Macs

When the Mac vs. PC wars start up, as they inevitably do, on
Usenet or Web message boards or just around the office, Mac
partisans always tout the dearth of viruses for their chosen
computer as one of the main benefits in adopting Apple's
operating system. And though, technically, there still may not
be very many viruses for the Mac, a new Mac e-mail worm has
recently been discovered and is making its way across iMacs and
Powerbooks everywhere.
http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2001/0611simpsons.html
IDG News Service, 06/11/01


* Virus hoax warns people to delete AOL

Perhaps the greatest thrill for any prankster is to have his
hoax taken as truth. Just such a thing has happened to Ray
Owens, who runs a Web site called Joke A Day. Owens sent an e-
mail to the 342,000 of his subscribers on June 5 (after an
initial mailing on June 2 to another list) warning them of a
new virus, called AOL.EXE. Warning your customers of a virus
seems like a nice thing to do, except that AOL.EXE isn't a
virus at all; it's the AOL application that provides Internet
access to millions of people worldwide.

IDG News Service, 06/11/01

* WM97/Myna-AR - A Word macro virus with no malicious payload.
(Sophos)

* XM97/Laroux-OC - This Excel macro virus spreads by creating a
file called ""BINV.XLS"" in the XLSTART directory. (Sophos)

* WM97/Opey-AU - This Word macro virus removes the macros
section of the tools menu and disables the Visual Basic Editor.
It also displays five different messages on five different
dates. (Sophos)

* XM97/Barisada-Y - An Excel macro virus that spreads via a
file called ""KHM.XLS"" in the XLSTART directory. Unlike its
predecessors, this one does not contain pop-up messages.
(Sophos)

* VBS/Lovelet-CE - Yet another variant of the infamous
LoveLetter virus. This one comes with a subject line of ""News
Email Beta Run1.01"" and a file attachment called
""NEWSEMAIL.VBS."" (Sophos)


>From the interesting reading department:


* Hackers taunt EC with site defacement

Dutch hackers on Tuesday evening defaced SaferInternet.org, a
Web site sponsored by the European Commission that promotes a
safer Internet. Security at the site had been increased just
last week after other hackers raised a red flag about possible
vulnerabilities.
http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2001/0613hackers.html
IDG News Service, 06/13/01


* Microsoft plugs seven Telnet security holes in Windows 2000

If the Telnet service included with Microsoft's Windows 2000
operating system has looked suspiciously like Swiss cheese
recently, that might be because it has seven security holes
that need patching. Microsoft has acknowledged the holes and
issued a patch late last week.
http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2001/0611msplug.html
IDG News Service, 06/11/01


* When private peering arrangements go bad: Cable & Wireless
shuts out 14 ISPs, including PSINet

Cable & Wireless likely didn't make any new friends on the
Internet last week when it started enforcing its newly revised
peering policy, cutting off service to more than a dozen ISPs.

Well, the time has finally arrived............after purchasing some bean bag 
and inflatable 'Southpark' chairs, I'm officially ready for a party.  Won't 
you please come  over and share in a few cocktails.   This Saturday, March 31 
at 7:30,  1314 Utah St.  (corner of Truro and Utah, near Memorial Park)   I 
will have beverages and snacks, but as in the past, no jello shots or Busch 
beer.  (sorry Matt and Mike)

Most of you aren't aware of where I live, but parking could be a problem. 
(sorry, no valet)   In the 'hood', people tend to park wherever they can, 
this being along all the streets surrounding the house as well as the 
volleyball courts at Bubbas.  Park wherever you can.

Please see the attached map or go to Yahoo Maps for assistance.  It works 
well if you use 1380 Utah St.  (Don't ask why)    Please pass this on to 
others that I may have overlooked.  Call if you have any questions.

Enron Turns Internal Credit-Risk Tool Into New Product
2001-04-04 17:19 (New York)



   By Christina Cheddar
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--With the number of corporate bankruptcies on the rise,
knowing the creditworthiness of one's customers is becoming more and more
important.
  For Enron Corp. (ENE), the world's largest energy trading company, keeping
track of credit risk has always been part of doing business. That became even
more true with the company's launch of EnronOnline, its Internet-based
commodities trading network.
  In order to deal with the accelerated volume and speed of transactions on
EnronOnline, the company developed a tool to help its own commercial traders
manage the credit risk.
  Early last year, Enron rolled out this tool, Enron Credit, on a limited
basis. Gradually, the company expanded its use and scope. Last month, the
company re-launched Enron Credit in its current format.
  Enron Credit tracks more than 10,000 companies, giving each a rating known 
as
the ""Enron cost of credit."" The rating is expressed as an interest rate.
  The Web site also provides news, a company's expected chance of bankruptcy
and other related information.
  While much of this information is free to registered users, Enron also has
turned the product into a new revenue stream.
  Users may download data into a spreadsheet and receive periodic updates for 
a
fee.
  The site also can sell a user a ""digital bankruptcy swap,"" which is a way to
hedge against credit exposure.
  The price of the swap is determined by a rating Enron's staff assigns to a
company and the amount of credit exposure a company needs to protect against.
  For a supplier, the main advantage of a swap is that if a customer is unable
to pay due to bankruptcy, the supplier will be paid immediately.
  According to Enron Europe President John Sherriff, the goal of Enron Credit
is to create a more efficient credit market by increasing trading liquidity.
  The tool is important because ""in just a short amount of time, a company's
credit can go from stellar to bad literally overnight.""
  At present, some analysts haven't factored in revenue from Enron Credit into
their earnings models. However, as the commodity markets Enron trades in
mature, it is possible the need for products such as Enron Credit could
increase.

"Sorry about that Edmund.  The forms have been moved out of the atty.fms bank

know if you can access other subdirectories.

We have made some substantive revisions to the ISDA Schedule and Credit

forms.  We've also made changes to the forms of guarantees.  They are now 
located in a document called Guaranty.doc in the Swap Forms/Current Forms

Also, the ISDA definitions have been changed since you've been gone, you may 
already know that, but just in case...I thought I'd bring it up."

P.S. do you know that edison at the FERC hearing said that it hedged $30MM

""gaming"" the system?  Inquiring minds want to know.  You may want to check in 
with Smutney when Edison made the statement.  There may be nothing to it, but 
it might be interesting to check into.  Is Edison one of those ""profiteers"" 
who ought to give San Diegans a refund?

Dan Walters: 2% problems vex governor


(Published Sept. 14, 2000)
Two percent doesn't sound like much of anything, but California's economy is
just so big -- a trillion-plus dollars a year, measured by either output or
personal income -- that even a tiny share can mean many billions of dollars.
As it happens, Gov. Gray Davis finds himself in the middle of several
quasi-economic, quasi-political squabbles, each of which involves a couple
of percentage points of California's economy -- and the outcome of which may
affect his governorship.
One showdown occurred last week when the Air Resources Board, an arm of the
Davis administration, decided to stick with its policy of compelling the
auto industry to sharply increase sales of zero-emission cars. There are
about 2,000 electric-powered cars now on California's roads, and the ARB
wants that to increase tenfold and beyond, despite industry assertions that
battery technology isn't advanced enough. Californians lay out about $20
billion a year for a million new cars -- 2 percent of the state's personal
income stream. The ARB's decision could either create an entirely new
industry of nonpolluting cars, as advocates claim, or reduce the overall
supply of cars that can be legally sold and drive up Californians' costs, as
critics maintain. And Davis will get the credit or blame.
Although exact numbers are hard to obtain, it's likely that within a few
years, Californians will be spending another $20 billion a year to gamble,
mostly in casinos operated by Indian tribes, thanks to legislation signed by
Davis -- a major recipient of tribal political contributions. Cardroom
operators, who say they may be driven out of business by lavish new Indian
casinos, persuaded the Legislature to pass two bills that would allow them
to offer new card games, including a form of blackjack. But the tribes
oppose such expansion, obviously wanting to maintain what is rapidly
becoming a state-sanctioned monopoly on casino gambling, and Davis must
decide the bills' fate. Regardless of what he does, cardroom operators are
mulling a federal lawsuit alleging that the Indian monopoly on slot machines
violates federal law, which generally grants Indian casinos parity with
other forms of gambling.
The final 2-percent issue facing Davis poses the greatest peril to his
governorship: the huge run-up in electric utility costs in the wake of
deregulation. Utilities were paying about $20 billion a year for power
before the recent spike, but their costs now have doubled. San Diego
ratepayers got hit first, but those in other major metropolitan areas could
feel the pocketbook pain soon.
Davis signed two measures, one that rolls back San Diegans' power bills
temporarily, but could lead to balloon payments later, and another to speed
up siting of new power plants. But they are, at best, stop-gap measures, and
he may veto a third bill that would have the state directly underwrite the
higher utility bills. What the governor appears to be doing, by word and
deed, is to plead with the Public Utilities Commission and the Energy
Commission to get him off the hook.
The timing is critical because Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern
California Edison say they are absorbing billions of dollars in higher
wholesale costs that they can't immediately pass on to consumers thanks to a
rate freeze. The freeze is supposed to end in 2002, just as Davis is seeking
a second term, and if he and his utility regulators can't come up with a
solution by then, all hell could break loose as consumers' bills escalate
sharply and they look for someone to blame.
Davis may not have had anything to do with the original deregulation
legislation -- as he points out at every opportunity -- but he's stuck with
the problem now. Dealing with it could be critical to his political future.

"We are working very diligently to accommodate the need for space on the 30th 
floor.  Unfortunately, we are not able to do any major construction to 
densify the floor during the next several months while Enron Property 
Services is completing the build-out of levels 29, 31 and 32.   In the mean 
time, we are going to build out the window spaces on 30 to increase the 
capacity on the floor.  While these locations are not prime spots, people 
will need to occupy them as our business continues to grow.  Once the window 
seats have been constructed (estimated to be 2-3 weeks), we will realign 
groups on the floor and people will need to move once again.

I am requesting your cooperation and patience to work with Lisa Cousino while 
she works with space planners to coordinate the location of Energy Operations 
personnel on the newly-constructed Commercial floors.  Susan Harrison is 
working with Lisa to manage the space planning on 30 during this transition 
period.  Chantelle Villanueva will be coordinating all moves of people and 
equipment on the 30th floor.  If there are any problems once a move has 
occurred (i.e., missing or non-working phones, boxes, computer equipment, 
printers, etc.), please contact Chantelle at Ext. 3-6279 as she will also 
coordinate the follow-up on all move-related items.  If Chantelle is not 
available, Maria Sandoval will be her backup.  Maria can be reached at Ext. 
3-5586.

I would also appreciate your help in cleaning up the floor, including the 
window spaces.  We can no longer maintain unnecessary boxes, paper and 
supplies on the floor.  Please coordinate with your assistant to have your 
area cleaned up by December 31.  During this clean-up process, if you have 
any documents that need to be filed and/or archived, please contact Carolyn 
Gilley in the Information and Records Management group at Ext. 3-5237 and she 
will make arrangements to pick up the information from the 30th floor.

Thank you in advance for your understanding and cooperation in maintaining a 
neat and professional work environment.  Between now and the summer of 2001 
when we will relocate to the new building, please keep in mind that we are 
all working in a temporary and makeshift environment.  I would greatly 
appreciate your patience and good humor as we struggle to use the available 
space effectively.

If I have missed anyone on the distribution list that has just recently moved 
to the 3oth floor, please forward this message to them.

Just a reminder that the contract we signed with Ken Smith is set to expire at the end of October. Contract terms allow for renewal, or extension, by written agreement of the parties.  


Commencing on May 1, 2001 Enron agreed to pay Ken $4000/month at a maximum of 25 hours/month.  Hours worked in excess of 25/month are paid at a rate of $160/hour. 


Termination of the contract requires that Enron give Ken Smith 30 days advance notice.  
  
If we choose to terminate, I suggest that Karen Denne contact Ken by telephone and also provide written notice of the termination immediately (unless you all agree that we should extend the contract).


Please let me and Karen know how you want to proceed by close of business Thursday. Thanks

"Mary Beth:  

For what it's worth, I've read this, and if Laura Tyson or Larry Summers sign 
it, I have serious concerns about the effect it would have on their ability 
to play the role that we envision in moving our proposal forward 
(understanding that our odds of success are somewhat meager).  While I don't 
disagree with the language, it is strong and therefore very likely to make 
the Governor and his staff very uncomfortable.  I would recommend that they 
do not sign.

I think you are mistaken.  I was watching E, the Entertainment Channel, last

Cannes.  I noticed this incredibly handsome and debonair man, dressed all in 
black from head to toe, a shy smile, with eyes hidden behind dark glasses,

   On another note, our Energy Club is fairly active at Wharton and would
   be very interested in featuring Terence Thorn if he is still with Enron
   (or your senior Government Affairs person if Mr. Thorn has left Enron).
   Could you kindly let me know how to contact Mr. Thorn (or his
   replacement) so I can speak with him/her briefly.  My alterior motive in
   asking you to do this is that you might copy him on your email to me so
   that he knows we are doing some work together.

   Thanks in advance.

   Subject: Speaker from Enron


   Paul,

   The speaker from Enron that I told you yesterday that I was interested
   in bringing in for the Energy Club Speaker Series is Terence H. Thorn,
   senior vice president, Environmental and International Government
   Affairs. A colleague of mine heard him speak in Kyoto in 1997 and said
   he gave a superb talk. As of 2000 he was still in this position, though
   I could not verify that he is now.

   The proposed topic is Global Warming Policy and the Energy Industry.
   ---How will the Bonn agreement affect global strategy? What will be the
   near-term and long-term consequences of the agreement?
   ---How does US non-participation affect US market strategies versus
   strategies in participating countries?
   ---What is Enron's current position on global greenhouse gas policy? How
   is Enron managing and hedging this position?
   ---How will developing country energy markets participate in greenhouse
   gas mitigation?

   The Energy Club Speaker Series takes place every other Monday from 4:30
   to 6:30. There are a number of dates open during Fall semester.

   I appreciate very much your help in trying to arrange this. Please let
   me know if there is any other information you need.

   Thank you,
   Amy

   Hi Amy,
   Did a little search on Enron's website and happened upon the guy's name.
   Terence H. Thorn, senior vice president, Environmental and International
   Government Affairs. Not sure if he is still with the company but see
   what your professor thinks. I will try to get my hands on his paper from
   the March 1997 meeting as well.

   Hi Michael

   Remember we talked about the Kyoto conference and you said you heard the
   Govt Affairs guy at Enron give an amazing speech about global warming? I
   ran the idea to get a speaker on global warming by the 2nd yr in charge
   of the Energy Club (http://dolphin.upenn.edu/~energy), and he thought
   that would be great. And furthermore, the prof who I do research
   for(Paul Kleindorfer)said he is very well connected with the big guys at
   Enron and would love to jointly sponsor the talk. SO, do you remember
   the guy's name? Was it Robert Reilly possibly? I don't know if he would
   still be there but we can try.

   Thanks-
   Amy Richard

"CC,

Do you still have the contact info for the escrow agent?  If so, it would be  
great it you would contact them directly.

The turbine contract is going back and forth between us and GE.  I expect 
that it may well be ready tomorrow.

I expect the Enron opinion letter to be an issue.

Subject: Delta Timetable


Kay:

Note the following timetable from the final version of the ENA/PPL letter
agreement:

(1)  ENA agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver the final
form of the turbine contract on or before April 11, 2001.
(2)  The parties agreed to commercially reasonable efforts to execute an
escrow agreement on or before April 16, 2001.
(3)  The escrow account must be funded 3 business days after the later of
(a) ENA's delivery of the final form of the turbine contract and (b) the
closing of PPL's financing.
(4)  ENA can terminate if the escrow is not funded on or before April 19,
2001 (but this date gets pushed back by one business day for each business
day beyond April 11, 2001 that ENA delivers the final form of the turbine
contract).
(5)  The closing occurs at least 5, but not later than 10, business days
after funding the escrow account.
(6)  Either party may terminate if the closing has not occurred on or before
May 3, 2001.

If ENA delivers the final form of the turbine contract on April 11, 2001,
then the April 19, 2001 right to terminate stands.  PPL's obligation to fund
the escrow would then be determined by the date of its loan closing.  Greg
Lang advises that they are working on PPL's financing, but he did not give
an estimated date for financial closing.  

I advised Greg on Friday that the legal opinions from both GE and Enron were
causing heartburn.  He agreed to pass this along to Isabel Parker.  He asked
today about GE's reaction to the consent document and if it would be
appropriate for Isabel Parker to contact GE directly at this point.  He also
requested a draft of the escrow disbursement instructions.  When you get a
chance, please advise of any comments in order that we can circulate for
PPL's review.  Also, we need to contact Citibank to clear the proposed form
of escrow agreement (and the anticipated disbursement instructions) and to
negotiate the fee.  Let me know if we can assist in this regard.  Thanks.

This request has been completed.

Also, I spoke with a contact in IRM and they said that the best way for Jason 
to keep is access would be to maintain his NT and Notes accounts and have him 
set up his Laptop/Desktop with a Terminal Server client.  With this Terminal 
Server client he can access the Enron network as if he's in the office (a 
little/lot slower).  

To get Terminal Server:  from his Enron Corp desktop he should click 
""Start-Programs-Utilities-Make Terminal Server Client Disks""  -  Then of 
course he needs to install TS on his machine at A&K (or home).

Let me know if you/he has any questions.

"Brent Price and I will be in the London office next week, arriving Monday 
morning and returning to Houston on Friday.  The purpose of my visit is in 
regard to my Global Risk Management Operations role,   I believe that Rick 
Causey met with you regarding some operations support that Brent and I will 
provide to Fernley during a transition period prior to the arrival and during 
the assimilation of Michael Jordan, the JP Morgan staffer that Fernley has 
hired.  Brent and I will be working with Fernley next week to iron out the 
details of our support for Fernley during that transition period.  We will 
also map out an Enron trading operations introduction  for Michael Jordan, 
which may involve a short stint for him in Houston.  My goal is to provide a 
strong resource to Fernley during this transition period and to work with 
Fernley to provide whatever assistance, training, and orientation to Michael 
in his role so that his assimilation can be as smooth and effective as 
possible.  

Another purpose for the trip is to spend some time with Fernley and his  
business controllers  to get their ideas on specific goals that as a group we 
would commit to for 2000.  I know that Barry and Richard Sage have many good 
ideas on how we can leverage knowledge and best practices across all Enron 
locations with trading operations.  My earlier trips to London this year were 
focused solely on Helsinki, and did not allow time to positively focus on 
leveraging worldwide operations experience.  I value input from other trading 
operations professionals and I look forward to the ideas that can be 
generated in working with Barry, Richard and some of their direct reports.  

I also contacted Tani Nath about my trip to see how I could support her as 
she moves into her role in Global Products.  I have not heard  from Tani, but 
I understand from others that she will be in the Houston office next week.  
It will be unfortunate to miss her on my trip, but based on my commitments in 
Houston and Rick Causey's desire to move forward on providing trading 
operations support to Fernley, next week is the best for me to be in London.  
I did meet with Tani for an hour when she was here week before last and 
offered to help her in any way if she made the decision to accept the role 
over Global Products.  I trust that she will contact me for that support as 
needed.  

I have scheduled a short meeting one on one with you while I am there to 
discuss how my global role can provide support and resources for your 
business efforts in London.  I look forward to meeting with you next week.  

This trip is not a leg of the worldwide operations/control review that we are 
conducting at Joe Sutton's request.   By circumstance, as you know, we have 
taken a look at Helsinki and subsequently Oslo and Frankfurt.  There will be 
a similar review of Continental power, UK gas, UK power and global liquids.  
The review teams are currently focused on operations/controls reviews of 
North American locations and some entities in the US in which Enron has a 
large ownership position.  It is likely that the continuation of this effort 
in London will occur in mid April.  

Copies of the drafts of the findings for Oslo and Frankfurt were provided to 
Fernley as soon as the team returned to Houston.  We hope to finalise those 
drafts this week as we receive comments from Fernley and the business 
managers in Oslo and Frankfurt to whom those drafts were provided.  Fernley 
suggested that you would like to see the drafts as opposed to the final 
copies, so I will have those forwarded to you today.  The Sydney and 
Singapore trip was a lengthy one, as it also involved a last leg of the trip 
in London with regard to support for SIngapore.  The Houston team returned 
the middle of last week and worked with AA on an early draft last Friday.  I 
can also provide you with a draft of that report, the completion of which was 
pending input from Bill Bradford early this week (he made the trip but was 
out of the office last week).  We did do a preliminary review of the Sydney 
and Singapore findings with Rick Causey and Rick Buy on Friday afternoon, to 
accommodate the fact that both are out on vacation this week.  They 
understood the preliminary nature of the draft that was reviewed with them.

Subject: Job application




Dear Dr. Kaminski,

I currently hold a post-doctorate position in the Mathematics
Department at the University of Texas at Austin (with a Ph.D.
in theoretical physics). Although my position here is renewable
until summer 2001, I would like to move on to a more dynamic field
where I can still use my analytical skills and mathematical knowledge.
Since attending a series of lectures on mathematical finance given
by Dr. Marc Potters last summer I started studying the subject on my
own and found it intriguing and challenging.

I am interested in a position in your group (RAC) at Enron.
Last fall in a Career seminar at UT you mentioned that people who are
interested can send you their resume. If this is still relevant, please
find below my resume (in Word 97 and text formats).
Thank you for your time.

Yours,
Nurit Krausz

Paul:

Got your voice mail regarding Anthony Pescetti running for a FERC seat.  Here are some quick thoughts.  Sue likely has some additional experiences and information to share.  Be happy to discuss further.

*	Republican assemblymember from the Sacramento area.
*	Was a member of the Sacramento muni utility district prior to going to the legislature.
*	Republican (minority) head of the assembly electricity oversight committee (the one that Rod Wright chairs).
*	Don't recall that he's ever seen a a pro-utility bill that he didn't like.
*	In fact, he sponsored some legislation just this past session that would have locked the utilities in to major parts of the gas industry, and specifically wold have locked out competition.  It was strongly opposed by industry and defeated.
*	When push came to shove, I can't think of a time he didn't side with the utilities.
*	Even when the Assembly Republicans were doing of good job of bottling up Davis' ridiculous bailout bills in Rod Wright's committee, Pescetti seemed to go along more to tweek the Democrats than to foster competition.
*	And even then, he followed; he didn't lead--other, more junior, members on the committee led.
*	Can't recall a time that he's been there for us.

I'd be happy to talk with him, but if we need someone at the Rick level to contact him, that's great, too.  Just let me know.
	
Best,
Jeff"

Jeff-

This is a guy from South Carolina who works with a bunch of industrial 
customers there.  At the last GridSouth meeting, he cornered Joe Connor and I 
and asked us about California and the price spikes there.  I told him a bunch 
of reasons why the price spikes happened, but it appears that he wants more 
information.

I would appreciate it if you would call him or if you could find someone else 
out there in CA to give him a call.  He is not super sophisticated, but he is 
the representative of some big clients, so I try to keep him happy.  [I think 
he represents Michelin and Nucor steel--two huge energy users in South 
Carolina.]

Thank you very much.

"Here's the latest that we have on the legislation (""82XX"") released on Friday.
The Assembly Energy Committee will hold an ""informational"" hearing on 82XX at 
1:30 PM PDT today.
""Informational"" means that there won't be a vote today.
Attended a meeting this morning with the business groups with Assemblyman 
Dutra (self-proclaimed pro-biz Democrat, who's an ""author""  of 82XX), 
Hertzberg's chief staffer, and Hertzberg's outside legal consultant.
The DWR contracts continue to be the roadblock to a rational solution.
Dutra is unhappy with the process thus far----claimed he wasn't familiar with 
the ""more recent version"" of the bill, and was unhappy that there would be a 
hearing today---informational or otherwise--before he and the bill's other 
authors had agreed to final language from their perspective.
Dutra said that he was working to remove the Direct Access suspension and 
asked the biz groups to hold their fire until the amendments come out 
tomorrow.
PUC President Lynch continues to oppose striking a deal in which the 
Commission gives up all review of DWR's ""revenue requirement"" and simply 
flows all DWR costs through rates (but Davis and his administration are 
putting her under enormous pressure to buckle under and agree).
As a result, details of any ""rate agreement"" between DWR and the CPUC, and 
any public announcement by DWR of its ""revenue requirement"" is could be 
postponed until next week, unless there's a breakthrough with Loretta.
The Governor's consultants now claim (and will reportedly testify at the 
hearing today) that there is enough room in the 3 cent rate increase to cover 
both Edison's and DWR's revenue requirements.  (They cite lower gas prices 
and FERC's price cap as the driving force for the newly-found headroom, 
though many remain very skeptical.)
However, if the deal is applied to PG&E, it is unlikely that the 3 cent rate 
would be sufficient, according to the same consultants.
The plan (at this point) is to have the bill--with amendments--discussed in 
the same committee tomorrow, and voted out of the committee.  The bill would 
then be taken to the full Assembly for an up or down vote on Wednesday.
It is unclear whether, at this point, there is agreement among Assembly 
Democrats to vote the bill out of the full Assembly on Wednesday.
In addition, Senate Democrats continues to work on their own version  of an 
Edison ""MOU,"" and the working relationship between the Assembly side and the 
Senate side appears strained.
The Republicans in the Assembly are staunchly opposed to 82XX and are 
generally being ignored by the Democrats, since the Democrats need no 
Republicans to get a majority vote to pass bills.
Meanwhile, Edison continues to twist.

Will report back after the 1:30 hearing today.

If anyone has questions, don't hesitate to contact me by pager @ 888.916.7184.

Best,
Jeff"

Vince,

I have penciled you in for Nov 13th for my class.  Does this work for you?
This is a Monday and I would suggest you come up Monday afternoon, you can
give a brief talk to our department late in the afternoon, and then you can
talk to my Ex MBAs at 6 p.m. for an hour or so.  I'll get you to the hotel
for the evening and we can work on the paper Tuesday morning.  I recommend
this Mon noon through Tue noon arrangement since I will be out of town the
weekend before the 13th.  If this needs reshuffling let me know.  We'll
make it work.

I look forward to talking with you later this week along with Mark Palmer.

John

Subject:	RE: CA question

Before we carry this much further, let me explain some more why I raised the question in the first place.

We currently assume that our exposure to CTC going forward is zero.  Arthur Andersen was questioning this assumption, as market prices in general are lower than embedded gen now (unless you include DWR costs), which implies that if we were under the old CTC regime we could be paying some positive CTC.  AA was wondering why we weren't holding some reserves for this eventuality.

Mary Lynne and I told them we weren't reserving b/c we just have no clear idea what will happen in the coming months re:CTC, but that in all likelihood zero is the best guess b/c no one can agree on what PX credit (""market"" price) is now that there is no PX.  Besides, though SCE and PG&E are arguing for different methods (the so-called ""top-down"" and ""bottom-up""), in the end the result will be about the same (CTC=0), especially now that PG&E has supposedly stopped ""adjusting"" the PX credit to recover past undercollections.  And of course, the DWR contracts muddy the waters, since if one includes them in the calculation of utility gen costs, then you could easily get to a negative CTC situation.  Bottom line: we think things are so screwed up that everyone will prefer just to ignore CTC for the few months remaining that it has to run.

In light of all this we thought we might further quell AA's skepticism if we could show that although we had once argued that DJI should be used as a substitute for PX credit, we were now simply arguing that DA should pay T&D only, and that CTC should become a relic of the past.

I think by now it may be a dead issue -- I believe AA has accepted our arguments w/o this extra bit of persuasion, else I would have heard more from Mary Lynne.  Thanks for all the background and input from everyone, and please let me know if you have any more relevant comments given this context.

All,

Attached is the 11/30/01 file which is probably the best information we have.  I have screened it so that it only includes those counterparties with financial mark to market exposure.  Additionally, I screened out all Enron entities except for ENA, ECC, and EPMI.  While I cannot guaranty that the data is completely accurate, it should give you the starting point you need to proceed with processing/prioritizing financial terminations.  Obviously, the values will be different from what is specified here based on the Termination Date specified by each counterparty.

Subject: Re: Price Cap Media--DRAFT  

I have a couple of suggestions on parts of the draft.

Media Action:
In addition to doing behind the scenes editorial board meetings and the like, 
I would suggest that we get our coalition lined up and ready to release 
statements for certain key events which are likely to occur over the next 
several weeks, such as:

1.  SDG&E's selection of the winning bid to their RFP.  Even if Enron isn't 
selected as the winning bid, the coalition should trumpet the market-based 
solution and the enormous market response to SDG&E's RFP.
2.  The Commission vote on UCAN's Emergency Motion.  We should be prepared to 
issue a statement whether the Cmmn votes with us or against us.  With us, the 
market can and did provide reasonable, expedient solutions to SDG&E's 
customers and protection from price spikes.  Against us, despite the 
overwhelming market response, the Cmmn chose to ignore the market solutions 
and impose more regulation.
3.  Potential for ARM members to surface a Provider of Last Resort proposal 
within the next couple of weeks.
4.  ISO Bd. Mtg-keep up pressure against reducing price caps.

Coalition Members:

Agree that those groups listed should be contacted, although the CMA, CRA, 
CIU, CLECA have been luke-warm in their advocacy.

I would add our customers (UC/CSU (especially the San Diego branch), PacTel, 
etc.)  NewEnergy has indicated that Kroger/Ralph's grocery stores, San 
Diego-based, would give testimonials.  I could solicit the members of ARM to 
identify a key customer contacts for interviews.  

We could check with our lobbyists and see who they would recommend (wine 
growers, dairy industry, etc.)  We should also consider the water agencies 
and the rural counties and the City of Pittsburg.  While the immediate 
message is responding to San Diego's situation, this latter group of 
potential coalition members would go to the larger message (keeping benefits 
of competitive markets) from a state-wide perspective.  What about the City 
of Pittsburg?

 On November 21, 1996, an explosion occurred in or around the Humberto Vida=

 Trojan Investment Recovery.  In early 1993, Portland General Electric=20
Company (PGE) ceased commercial operation of the Trojan nuclear power=20
generating facility (Trojan).  In April 1996 a circuit court judge in Mario=
n=20
County, Oregon, found that the Oregon Public Utility Commission (OPUC) coul=
d=20
not authorize PGE to collect a return on its undepreciated investment in=20
Trojan, contradicting a November 1994 ruling from the same court.  The ruli=
ng=20
was the result of an appeal of PGE=01,s March 1995 general rate order which=
=20
granted PGE recovery of, and a return on, 87% of its remaining investment i=
n=20
Trojan.  The 1994 ruling was appealed to the Oregon Court of Appeals and wa=
s=20
stayed pending the appeal of the OPUC=01,s March 1995 order.  Both PGE and =
the=20
OPUC separately appealed the April 1996 ruling, which appeals were combined=
=20
with the appeal of the November 1994 ruling at the Oregon Court of Appeals.=

On June 24, 1998, the Court of Appeals of the State of Oregon ruled that th=

 PGE and the OPUC each filed petitions for review with the Oregon Supreme=

Court.  On August 26, 1998, the Utility Reform Project filed a petition for=

review with the Oregon Supreme Court seeking review of that portion of the=

Oregon Court of Appeals decision relating to PGE=01,s recovery of its=20
undepreciated investment in Trojan.  On April 29, 1999, the Oregon Supreme=

Court accepted the petitions for review.  On June 16, 1999, Oregon House Bi=
ll=20
3220 authorizing the OPUC to allow recovery of a return on the undepreciate=
d=20
investment in property retired from service was signed.  One of the effects=
=20
of the bill is to affirm retroactively the OPUC=01,s authority to allow PGE=
=01,s=20
recovery of a return on its undepreciated investment in Trojan.

 Relying on the new legislation, on July 2, 1999, PGE requested the Oregon=

Vince,

Before leaving for India I just wanted to jot you this small reminder to talk 
to Jeff Shankman on Monday.

Aside from myself, I wanted to remind you to talk about Anshuman Shrivastava, 
who is currently Assistant Manager in India, and has my recommendation for 
promotion to Manager.  He is our point person on many DPC matters, and is 
also the person I have used on most fuel related issues.  He will be a real 
asset to Jeff when located in HOuston.  Sinc he is single, and quite young, 
it will not be a problem to move him here at short notice.

I will call you from India as soon as I get in.  It will be Monday evening in 
Houston at that time, so could you please jot me a note telling me what would 
be a good number to call you on.  

I look forward to working with the team in Research.

Thanks again,

Regards,
Sandeep.

"I have always worked right up until my due date.  There is a lot of waiting 
and somehow I thought that the time passed more quickly if I was in the 
office in my normal routine.  Meagan was due on Wednesday, May16.  I set my 
last date of work for Friday, May 11.  Mom came in that weekend for Mothers' 
Day ( you were with her, right?) and then we did stuff the next couple of 
days until Meagan was born.  With Amanda, I owned the shop at the time and I 
was probably in the shop the morning of the day she was born.  She was a week 
late, so we just didn't know what to expect.  Tyler's due date was December 
18, and I set my last day of work for the Friday before that date.  Of 
course, then he was late, but we were in the throws of remodeling, so I was 
out picking out carpet and paint in those final days.  A lot of this probably 
depends on how tired you are and whether or not you feel like you have 
everything at the house ready.  I still had a lot of energy at the end of my 
pregnancies and I had also managed to get rooms ready early, so I enjoyed 
working as long as I could.  

Definitely make a point of you and Chris going to some movies at the theater 
before the baby comes.  You won't be able to do that for quite a while 
afterwards!!

I am with Enron?s thermal power generation company in Panama. Ours is the largest thermal power plant (320 MW) in a system with over 540 MW in hydro power capacity. In order to better program our operations for the next two years, it would help us to determine the probability of another El Nino event in the next 18 to 24 months. In case of a high probability we could even bring down a barge-mounted plant to provide back up power to Panama?s and other Central American countries which are heavily dependent on hydro power. Panama and Central America suffers serious droughts during an El Nino event.

Whatever help you can provide will be greatly appreciated.

"T
he first detailed allegations that Enron
abused mark-to-market accounting to
hide wholesale trading losses have
emerged in congressional testimony pro-vided
by a professor and former deriva-tives
trader who reviewed the Enron case
for Senate Governmental Affairs Com-mittee.
Those charges, along with allega-tions
that have surfaced that mark-to-market
accounting was misused by Enron
Energy Services, the company's retail
energy and services unit, are expected to
support the push by accounting rulemak-ers
for much more disclosure on mark-to-market
accounting practices and the
impact of mark-to-market accounting on
earnings trading firms' earnings.
In testimony Thursday before the
Senate Governmental Affairs Committee
last week, Frank Partnoy of the Universi-ty
of San Diego Law School, said it
appears that Enron traders mismarked
forward curves and manipulated the
amount of profits and losses that would
be reported in financial statements.
""In a nutshell, it appears that some
Enron employees used dummy accounts
and rigged valuation methodologies to cre-ate
false profit-and-loss entries for the deriv-atives
Enron traded,"" said Partnoy, who
reviewed the case over several weeks at the
committee's request. ""It appears that Enron
traders selectively mismarked their forward
curves, typically in order to hide losses.""
""Traders are compensated based on
their profits,"" he observed, ""so if a trader
can hide losses by mismarking forward
curves, he or she is likely to receive a
larger bonus.""
Partnoy said mismarking forward
curves was not the only problem.
""For each trade,"" he testified, ""a
trader would report either a profit or loss,
typically in spreadsheet format. These
profit-and-loss reports were designed to
reflect economic reality. Frequently they
did not. Instead of recording the entire
profit for a trade in one column, some
traders reportedly split the profit from a
trade into two columns. The first column
reflected the portion of the actual profits
the trader intended to add to Enron's cur-rent
financial statements. The second col-umn,
ironically labeled the 'prudency'
reserve, included the remainder.""
Partnoy told the committee that in
his estimation, ""Enron's 'prudency'
reserves did not depict economic reality,
nor could they have been intended to do
so. Instead, 'prudency' was a slush fund
that could be used to smooth out profits
and losses over time. The portion of prof-its
recorded as 'prudency' could be used
to offset any future losses,"" he said.
He recommended that investigators
question Enron employees who were
involved in these transactions ""to get a sense
of whether my summaries are complete.""
Alleged Enron abuses of mark-to-market accounting emerge"

Rumor has it that Jim Newsome will be named Interim Chairman of the CFTC 
today or tomorrow.  No word yet on who will be the Bush selection for CFTC

"I'm really sorry about the confusion - I actually just got filled in myself. 
I entered these deals for Mike Swerzbin yesterday, but he gave me an 
incorrect delivery point (mid-columbia instead of montana system border). 
Then Cara Semperger, in Scheduling, went in to change the delivery point and 
felt that the deal should be combined into one with three legs instead of 
three separate deals. 

So, in the end, she killed 597244 and 597245, and added two legs to 597246. 
I'm not sure she talked to John Malowney about any of this, otherwise he 
probably would have told her that he already approved the confirm letter.

Please let me know if you'd like comments added to this deal, and I'll do it 
right away.

Thanks for your help on this,
Kate

Help, I'm confused!  Yesterday I prepared a confirmation for three Montana 
Power deals, # 5467244, 597245, 597246.  I sent it to John Malowney and he 
approved it and I faxed it out. Today I noticed two of the deals have been 
killed and two legs added to the other deal.  I think it is the same deal, 
but can someone put notes into the deals saying what they did and why?

Thanks!

"The missing Richter trades are all EES sleeves that he neglected to enter 
before leaving for Houston this afternoon. Since Risk is running their calc, 
Chris Mallory said he's enter the deals first thing in the morning. 

The Fischer deals - 563728 and 563729 - have been changed to Constellation, 
per Matt Motley who did the trades.

And the other two deals where the brokers have been changed look fine. Would 
you let me know beforehand next time, just in the offhand chance that the 
trader entered other things in the deal incorrectly? Thanks for your help.

effective 12/1999 production forward.  

Please let me or rates coordinator know if you have any questions.  If

Subject: Rates Corrections

Per our discussion this morning, we are going to discontinue correcting rates 
in Unify/Sitara for for production months older than 12/1999.  (Applause 
here!)  Any adjustments that are required prior to 12/1999 production will be 
handled via a manual line item.  

Manual line items must be entered in the correct contract, production date, 
etc. and must reflect the correct fee type.  For example, if you are 
correcting demand, the fee type should be demand, not commodity.  Same 
applies to cashouts and commodity.
All Service invoices for all production months through 11/1999 must be 
corrected manually and finaled by the end of 1/2000 accounting.  Any 
exceptions need to be discussed with me before we close.  The Rates team will 
also not make any adjustments on Monday, 1/31.  This should allow you time to 
redraft and see if any additional manual need to be entered to insure that we 
close with everything finaled.
Beginning with 12/1999 production, all rate issues must be corrected within 
Unify/Sitara.  Any line items booked because the adjustment wasn't made by 
the Rates team in time to pay the invoice must be corrected in the system and 
reversed by the end of the same accounting month.  For items that have been 
identified as manuals that won't be reversed, an explanation needs to be 
provided to me at the end of the month.
The rates team will not adjust Unify/Sitara for periods prior to 12/1999 
unless agreed upon by the Rates coordinator and the Volume Management 
coordinator.  They will make their changes effective dated 12/1999 production 
forward.  

Upcoming goal -- we will be working to clear all 1999 tranport OA issues by 
the end of 2/2000 accounting...  Once the numbers booked in Unify are final, 
we should be able to resolve the PMA issues we have had outstanding.

Company Press Release

SOURCE: Enron Corp.

Enron Hosts Annual Analyst Conference; Provides
Business Overview and Goals for 2000

HOUSTON, Jan. 20 /PRNewswire/ -- Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE - news) hosted its 
annual equity analyst conference today in
Houston. Ken Lay, Enron chairman and chief executive officer, opened the 
conference by highlighting Enron's tremendous
growth across all businesses and the outstanding 700 percent return to 
shareholders over the past decade. 

     Enron presented key objectives for 2000:
     Continued strong growth in the core Wholesale Energy businesses.
     Break-out performance from Retail Energy Services.
     Rapid development of Enron Broadband Services.

Enron's ability to extend core skills and competencies to new markets was a 
recurring theme throughout the day.

Wholesale Energy Business

Growth prospects remain strong for Wholesale Energy Operations and Services, 
Enron's largest business. Wholesale energy
growth in North America is expected to be driven by the continuing 
deregulation of power markets in the United States and
large-scale energy outsourcing by utilities and large energy consumers. Enron 
expects to continue to broaden its early lead
across the European continent as markets quickly open to competition. 
Finally, Enron is rapidly expanding its wholesale
presence in other markets such as Japan, where large customers will be 
permitted to choose their electricity provider in March
2000.

EnronOnline will provide additional wholesale growth as incremental sales are 
generated through this innovative, Internet-based
transaction system. Over 450 customers around the world have used EnronOnline 
and over 10,000 transactions have been
completed since its introduction in late November 1999. Yesterday, 
EnronOnline transaction levels reached a new record with
over 700 transactions, representing a notional value of $250 million. 
Transaction processing costs with EnronOnline are
significantly lower than costs associated with traditional transaction 
methods.

Enron's Gas Pipeline Group is also well positioned to continue growing, with 
expansions planned or underway on several of its
systems.

Retail Energy Services

With over 16,500 facilities under management, the infrastructure is in place 
to service customers worldwide. As the strong
contracting momentum continues, Enron Energy Services is poised to rapidly 
increase earnings in 2000. Enron Energy Services'
goal for 2000 is to sign new contracts representing $16 billion in future 
expenditures by customers for energy and energy
services, nearly double the level in 1999.

Enron Broadband Services

The new name of Enron's communications business, Enron Broadband Services, 
reflects its role in the very fast growing market
for premium broadband services. Enron is deploying an open, flexible global 
broadband network controlled by software
intelligence, which precludes the need to invest in a traditional 
point-to-point fiber network. This Enron Intelligent Network is
widely interconnected to both other wholesale bandwidth carriers and to 
Internet service providers, thus providing the platform
for two new Enron business centers, bandwidth intermediation and broadband 
content delivery.

A direct transfer of Enron's core market making and risk management skills 
from its energy businesses, bandwidth
intermediation will provide capacity- holders a vast array of alternatives 
for flexible, low cost capacity. Enron will also provide
premium broadband content services, such as high-quality video-streaming and 
large broadband file transfer, with differentiated
levels of quality in a usage-based business model.

As announced in a separate release, Enron also reached an agreement with Sun 
Microsystems that provides for accelerated
development of broadband Internet services.

Enron is one of the world's leading electricity, natural gas and 
communications companies. The company, which owns
approximately $34 billion in energy and communications assets, produces 
electricity and natural gas, develops, constructs and
operates energy facilities worldwide, delivers physical commodities and 
financial and risk management services to customers
around the world, and is developing an intelligent network platform to 
facilitate online business. Enron's Internet address is
www.enron.com, and the stock is traded under the ticker symbol, ``ENE.''

This press release includes forward looking statements within the meaning of 
Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and
Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Although Enron believes 
that its expectations are based on reasonable
assumptions, it can give no assurance that its goals will be achieved. 
Important factors that could cause actual results to differ
materially from those in the forward looking statements herein include 
political developments in foreign countries, the ability to
penetrate new wholesale and retail natural gas, electricity and broadband 
services markets, including the energy outsource
market, in the United States and Europe, the timing and extent of changes in 
prices for crude oil, natural gas, electricity and
those relating to broadband services and content, the timing and effect of 
changes in interest rates, the timing and success of
Enron's efforts to develop domestic and international power, pipeline, 
communications, internet- related and other infrastructure
projects, and conditions of the capital markets and equity markets during the 
periods covered by the forward looking
statements.

"PG&E utility reorganization draws fire in Calif 
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 10 (Reuters) - PG&E Corp.'s plan to reorganize its bankrupt Pacific Gas & Electric unit, California's biggest utility, is coming under fire as a bid to dodge state regulation. 
Critics said that with California beginning to emerge from a two-year energy crisis triggered by a failed deregulation law that drowned the state's utilities in red ink, now is no time to abandon state oversight. 
Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), called the plan ""a regulatory jailbreak"" and ""a corporate shell game to evade proper state regulation"" by transferring assets to unregulated PG&E affiliates. 
The reorganization plan would split the parent company and its utility into stand-alone companies, transferring the hydro network, Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant and gas and electric transmission systems to unregulated units of parent PG&E. 
The utility would continue to own and operate local gas and power distribution grids serving about 13 million customers. 
The plan would allow all valid creditor claims to be paid without the need for a rate increase or state bailout, said Bob Glynn, chairman, president and chief executive of PG&E. 
It would provide creditors with about $9.1 billion in cash and $4.1 billion in notes. 
EYE ON HYDRO SYSTEM 
One of the concerns arising from the plan is how Pacific Gas & Electric would continue to manage its hydroelectric properties, which make up the world's largest privately held hydropower system. 
Elected officials from 28 counties in PG&E's sprawling hydro watershed in central and northern California will meet Friday to weigh actions on the reorganization plan filed at the San Francisco federal bankruptcy court Sept. 20. 
The Regional Council of Rural Counties is worried about who will safeguard the environmental health of the hydro system's rivers and lakes that are the foundation for fishing, boating and tourism in an area that sprawls across about two-thirds of the state, council vice president Wes Lujan told Reuters. 
PG&E spokesman Jon Tremayne said the hydro system, nuclear reactors and transmission systems would continue to be regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 
The utility also would continue to get power from plants it now owns under a 12-year deal at 5 cents per kilowatt hour. 
But State Attorney General Bill Lockyer said he is looking closely at the plan because of ""serious concerns the utility is seeking to evade further scrutiny by the CPUC"" and avoid state laws on the asset transfers. 
Lockyer said that in the past, PG&E had used CPUC oversight as a shield against federal scrutiny. 
Despite PG&E's claim that the CPUC has no jurisdiction on the transfer of power and transmission assets to the parent, CPUC chief counsel Gary Cohen said the agency's approval is required under state law. 
'FIRE SALE PRICES' 
""PG&E's goal is clear. They want to transfer most of the utility's valuable assets to an affiliate company, at fire sale prices, so that they will no longer be subject to any state regulation. It is a deregulation plan, not a reorganization plan,"" Cohen said. 
""PG&E's plan conflicts with California's interest to have a more stable and regulated energy system. Deregulation has failed the public, and we will look at every opportunity to put down this attempt to solve the failure of deregulation with more deregulation,"" said Doug Heller, of consumer advocate The Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. 
PG&E's Tremayne said the plan makes the most sense for California because units of PG&E would continue to own and manage power production and transmission. 
Tremayne said, however, the reorganization plan does not bar a future sale to another company. 
PG&E's plan would give the utility $4.5 billion from the asset transfers to help pay off about $13 billion in debts, including $9 billion in unrecovered power purchase costs. 
The CPUC's Cohen and consumer groups said PG&E should receive far more than $4.5 billion from the assets. 
They point to the value of the hydro network. Last fall, the utility dropped a plan to sell the hydro system to its parent for $2.8 billion because the system was ""undervalued in today's market"" and could fetch a much higher price through an auction. 
The PG&E utility and Edison International's Southern California Edison utility amassed billions of dollars of debt because the deregulation law prevented them from passing steep wholesale power prices to their customers. 
SoCal Edison and the CPUC reached a deal Oct. 2 to keep the utility out of the bankruptcy court and pay off its creditors. "

Proposal to Alleviate California=01,s Electricity Shortage
Through Incentives to Reduce Demand

Objective
=06=15 Provide consumers with financial incentives to reduce demand in=20
anticipation of Summer 2001 electricity demand

Proposal
=06=15 The California PUC should require the utilities to immediately condu=
ct=20
on-line auctions for demand reductions totaling at least 2,000 MWs
=06=15 Alternatively, DWR could run the auction and implement the buy-down=
=20
program.  However, if it is determined that DWR requires additional authori=
ty=20
to execute the auction, the State should avoid any further delays and direc=
t=20
the CPUC to order the utilities to implement the buy-down program immediate=
ly.

The Auction Process (assuming the utilities implement the program)
=06=15 Businesses and large consumers willing to commit to sustained reduct=
ions=20
through November 1, 2001 would submit bids indicating the price they would =
be=20
willing to receive for a given quantity of permanent reduction=20
=06=15 If the =01&supply=018 of available reductions offered in the auction=
 exceeds=20
2,000 MWs, the utility should accept them, or explain to the Commission why=
=20
they chose not to accept them=20
=06=15 Businesses should be permitted to include in their bids the continue=
d=20
payment of wages to compensate employees for hours of employment foregone d=
ue=20
to demand reductions

A Single Price Approach
=06=15 A single price approach to a demand buy down program has two key=20
disadvantages:
=06=15 First, customers who would be willing to reduce demand for a lesser =
price=20
will be overpaid, much in the same way the single price auction in the PC=
=20
overpaid lower cost generators.  The state would overpay for reduced demand=
=20
under the single price approach.
=06=15 Second, the single price may not attract sufficient demand reduction=
s.
=06=15 Further, the single price approach does not provide greater certaint=
y=20
regarding the cost of demand reductions.  By conducting an auction the stat=
e=20
will be able to observe all bids and pay on an as bid basis, starting with=
=20
the lowest bids necessary to provide the required demand reductions up to t=
he=20
cost the state is willing to pay.
=06=15 A single price approach, however, could work if targeted at customer=
s who=20
would not participate in an auction, i.e. residential customers.  A well=20
publicized program of rebates to residential customers who use less than la=
st=20
year would further reduce demand in the state.  Thus the auction and the=20
single price could be structured in a complimentary fashion.
=06=15 The costs of the incentive program should be paid for by all consume=
rs,=20
since all consumers will benefit from the decreased risk of service=20
interruptions caused by the demand reductions
=06=15 If DWR implements the program, DWR=01, would recover its costs throu=
gh rates,=20
similar to the cost recovery mechanism used to recover power purchase costs=
.
=06=15 If the utilities implement the program, the California PUC would inc=
lude=20
program costs in rates collected from customers
=06=15 The auction should be conducted online which will increase transpare=
ncy and=20
reduce the time required to complete the process

Hazards to Avoid
=06=15 Avoid allowing lengthy utility and/or PUC review to delay implementa=
tion of=20
the reductions
_ Any unnecessary delay increases the chance that California will fail to=
=20
achieve the reductions needed to help avoid severe shortages in Summer 2001
_ There are numerous firms offering moderately-priced on-line auction=20
services that can quickly provide auction services to the utility
_ The utility should immediately contract for on-line services and present=
=20
the contract to the California PUC for prompt approval
_ The utilities should also include in their submittal to the PUC a simple,=
=20
streamlined set of pre-qualification criteria that would apply to bidders
_ The pre-qualification criteria should be designed with the goal of making=
=20
participation as easy and expansive as possible
_ Pre-qualification will encourage legitimate offers and reduce transaction=
=20
time
_ Once the PUC has approved the auction process, the PUC should not apply a=
ny=20
additional review to the auction results
_ Auction =01&pre-approval=018 will ensure that the utilities are actively =
and=20
constructively engaged

Actions
=06=15 Governor=01,s office directs PUC to initiate auction and residential=
 program
=06=15 CPUC directs utility to submit auction proposal within 30 days
_ Establish abbreviated schedule
_ Provide parties with abbreviated opportunity to comment
_ Finalize decision approving auction proposal within 15 days of utility=20
submission
=06=15 CPUC rules in advance that results of auction are prudent, and utili=
ties=20
conduct auction by May 1"

Steve,

Actually, EOL and other units of Enron have declined to participate and 
specifically asked not to be included in the press release.  Confidentially, 
this is a case of a developer overselling use of the Enron name for 
approximately $5 million equity stake.  We have caught him in many half 
truths and are uncomfortable going too far with this since we might get be 
placed in an awkward position.  Because of EOL and our own concerns, we 
intentionally toned it down.  I believe, in fact, that it is just another 
platform as well as an investment.  Consequently, we would prefer to keep 
this to the minimum of allowing them to issue a press release as included in 
the contract.  Your concurrence would be appreciated.  I am available, if you 
wish to discuss this further.

"THIRD EXTRAORDINARY SESSION CALLED 
Governor Davis has called a special session on Tuesday, October 9 to consider and act upon legislation affecting the operation, maintenance, finances, and financial viability of investor-owned utilities that provide electricity or natural gas to California residents and businesses, including their procurement portfolios and practices, and service by alternate energy providers in their service territory. 
Extraordinary (Special) Session Rules and Procedures
Call of Special Session: 
Only the Governor has the authority to convene a special session of the Legislature. In convening the session, the Governor must issue a proclamation outlining the reasons for the special session, and only issues specified in the proclamation may be acted upon. 
Election of Special Session Officers, Committees and Bill Referrals: 
The election of officers and the appointment of special session committees are separate from the Legislature's regular session. In some instances, special session committees are comprised of different committee members than those appointed to regular session committees. 
Identification of Special Session Bills and Publications: 
Separate record-keeping publications (File, History, Journal and Roll Call) are printed for each individual extraordinary session. Special session bills are identified by specific paper colors (i.e. blue or green). For example, documents in the 2001 Second Extraordinary Session are printed on green paper. 
Introduction of Special Session Bills: 
There is no limit to the number of bills that a member of the Legislature may introduce during the extraordinary session, and none of the bills introduced during the extraordinary session count toward the member's bill limit in the Regular Session. 
Special Session Bill Procedures and Calendars: 
There is no bill introduction deadline during special sessions, and the ""30-day in print"" rule and committee file notice requirements do not apply. Special session bills also are not subject to the regular legislative session calendar, committee and/or floor deadlines. The sine die deadline requiring session to adjourn on November 30 of the second year of a legislative session does apply to the Special Session. 
Effective Date of Special Session Legislation: 
Simple majority vote special session bills take effect on the 91st day after the special session is adjourned. Urgency measures and other two-thirds majority-vote bills take effect immediately upon the Governor's signature. The Governor has 12 days from the date it is received on his desk to sign or veto legislation. Similar to the Regular Session, a special session bill may become law without the Governor's signature. 
End of Special Session: 
Only the Legislature, by concurrent resolution, may end a special session. The concurrent resolution takes effect upon passage by both houses of the Legislature, and is not subject to a Governor's signature or veto. "

Jeff Dasovich and I, along with several IEP members, met with Gov Davis'=20
staff today, including his Chief of Staff, his Staff Director and two polic=

The Governor is personally spending a great deal of time on electricity=20

they put special emphasis on the view that in addition to supply shortfalls=

a big part of the problem is a ""dysfunctional market"" -- a thinly veiled=20
reference to price manipulation by people sitting in the room.
The Governor's view is that all participants (regulators, utilities,=20
customers and generators) must ""behave responsibly"".
Everyone must ""share the pain"".
The legislative battles are likely to start as soon as the legislature=20
returns next week, and the Governor will be putting forth several legislati=

proposals in the next couple of weeks.
While staff went out of its way to say that the list of proposals (in the=

fairly clear that they defined much of what the governor plans to propose.

The meeting was not very encouraging nor did it provide much in the way of=

deferred costs and consumers absorbing some of the deferred costs in the fo=

of higher rates.  That leaves generators ... who they might want to either=

agree to some refunds or provide power at lower going-forward prices.

The staff says that they remain open to proposed solutions, but the Davis=

"Jeff,
 I had informed them that I was out Monday, however they scheduled the 
meeting anyway.  I forwarded our standard enfolio to Teresa for this deal.  
She wants to delete the $0.15 from 3.2 and 3.4.  I suggested that we delete 
it in the transaction documents, but I think she will insist that it be taken 
out of the master.  I had requested that they invite Scott Neal to the 
meeting to discuss what they viewed as their obligation if the producer did 
not deliver the production payment volumes.  They had suggested that they use 
the enfolio default mechanism to calculated the $ damages, but in lieu of 
paying the $s, they would deliver a volume equal to such $s in a future 
undefined period.  Later they agreed that because of the financial hedge that 
was being put into place, they could pay such $ damages  at the time of 
default.  
 If they need someone from gas trading, can you attend Monday.  I am going to 
leave Teresa a message requesting that she try to get Scott Neal or his 
representative to attend and to let you know if your attendance was needed.

Dear Joannie,

Minister Luhut Pandjaitan will be attending the USA
Meeting 2001 in Washington, DC over the next two days.
 He has requested a bilateral meeting with Mr.
Skilling, and would like to arrange a time (it is no
problem to find a meeting room here at the Chamber on
either April 4 and 5). If it is easier, you can reach
the Minister's accompanying advisor, Mr. Mani Maren,
directly at the following mobile number:
++62-81-693-0637. Alternatively, please feel free to
call me in order to confirm a meeting time
(++41-79-615-1612). The Minister is available
throughout the day on Wednesday, or early on Thursday
morning.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
Swathi Kappagantula

"Mark:

I'm getting calls from different people with AA requesting copies of all ""legally approved"" confirmation templates.  I've had requests today from two different people with respect to power and rate/FX.  Do we have a formal process for  approving templates?  Where are the templates kept and how does legal know if they have been changed?   Have similar requests been made for other products?  There does not seem to be any sort of AA uniform deadline for submitting the templates.

I've asked AA to advise you so that we can all be consistent in our responses.

Subject: ML Power Group-EIX-Update Following Meeting With Management


* We met with Edison management on Friday (10/12) to discuss the recently
announced settlement agreement between the company and the CPUC.  The
agreement, which was approved by Judge Lew on 10/5, provides a framework for
Edison to repay creditors on a Q1 2002 time frame and, ultimately, to resume
power procurement responsibilities.
* Edison?s current estimate is that past power procurement debts will be
recovered by year-end 2003.  Discussions are ongoing with banks regarding a
bridge loan, which is key in terms of getting creditors paid on time.
* Negotiations with the renewable QF generators continue with both sides
apparently seeking a fixed-price contract.  The main issue is likely to be
timing of the switch to a new pricing formula, particularly as there will
likely be a substantial increase over current payments indexed to gas
prices.
* Regarding other generator creditors, Edison will be pursuing a negotiated
settlement.  One key date in this process is March 31, 2002, after which
Edison is committed to join the state and the CPUC in pursuing legal action
to recover alleged generator overcharges.
* One option is a so-called ?grand agreement? under which Edison would agree
on the starting amount owed to each generator.  This would potentially
release Edison to negotiate with the individual generators directly, as
opposed to through the PX/ISO.
* Edison expects to provide more detail of its earnings outlook within a few
weeks ? but probably not in time for the Q3 results release though.
* Several key accounting issues need to be resolved first, notably whether
or not the PROACT (Procurement Related Obligations Account) will be set up
as a regulatory asset.  Another key issue outstanding is the utility
retained generation (URG) rate proceeding currently under way at the CPUC.
* Given the above uncertainties, it is still difficult to be precise about
the earnings impact of the Edison settlement.  For the time being we are
sticking with our 2002E of $1.60, comprising $1.40 from the utility and
$0.20 for the non-regulated businesses and parent.  There is potential
upside to our numbers, particularly if previous tax sharing arrangements are
restored under the terms of the settlement agreement.
* Edison is trading at 9.6x our 2002E, only modestly below the group average
multiple.  We see only modest upside from here at this stage, although
clarity on the non-regulated outlook is a potential positive catalyst."

Sally, 
In answer to your question regarding the approval process for sign on 
bonuses, Sheila Walton informed me of the following. 
If you are primarily in agreement regarding a small sign on bonus award,  
then no further approval process is necessary.     If the sign on bonus 
amount is substantial then approval from David Oxley is advisable.   
In our current case, a $5,000.00 sign on for a Sr. Specialist would not 
require additional approval except your own.   
I will continue to monitor sign on bonus offers and provide you with a 
recommendation based on all available factors.

"Poll thus far:
Aron Thomas (AES) just decided not to file.  He made the decision after 
talking to Edison, who told him that Edison is going to suggest in its filing 
that the surcharge be applied--get this--to the PX credit; thus, ESPs would 
pay, but then get it back through the credit (can you say ""poor quality 
receivables""?).  Aron feels that the issue should be figured out in work 
shops and the Commission should not decide it in the policy phase.
Bill Booth (CLECA) is going to remain silent on the issue because he doesn't 
know what the position of his members is.
Keith McCrae (CMA) is going to say that 1) the surcharge should not apply to 
direct acces customers and 2) the governor stated publicly that he supports 
direct access.

Jeanne's checking with the Industrial Users Group to see what they're going 
to say.  Since CMA is going to ask for clarification, I would suggest that we 
remain silent and focus on the other rate design/cost allocation issues, 
e.g., equity, no cross subsidies.  

Thoughts?

I let you know what I hear back from Jeanne.

"Hey, we all can use a little money.  Life doesn't seem to get any cheaper.

Hello ladies.

I have the signed original (all parnters have signed) of the going out of
business documents for Anglers.  What is next?

Honey, Kay seems to think there is one more form of some kind, plus a filing
fee.  What do you know about those items?  I'm ready to make a final
distribution and let you close out the account.  I'll be happy to deliver
these papers to whomever is the appropriate person, agencey, etc. and help
in any way to stop the insanity.
Can we obtain the final cost for filing the papers, keep that in cash and
make the final checks out?

My Anglers papers show the following percentages, just in case you've gotten
rid of your files:

Alves         21.775
Ashworth        4.265
Bailey         10.895
Dill         10.895
Lockwood      15.235
Mann           4.265
Napoli         10.895
Turner         21.775

And......Kay, before you start making some smart ...comments,  I don't need
the money and in fact I'll buy the first and last bottle of Krug if we can
get together for a final distribution ceremony.

As I always tell Dill (a.k.a. Mokhtar, his new Egyptian

Ron:

I added to your spreadsheet the valuation of the combined Peregrine and Shortfall restrictions using an approach that Vassant and I discussed yesterday. 
It assumes: 
	1) Below $50.00 Shortfall will have restrictions on the whole number of shares (18MM shares); 
	2) Above $76.00 Peregrine will be fully rstricted.
	3) Between $50.00 and $76.00 Peregrine will bear a restriction proportional to (S-50)/(76-50) on 18MM shares and 
	   the Shorfall takes the restriction on the remaining shares.
Let's fix some time today to discuss the approach and results.

Let's meet in the morning and discuss the LOI.

Kay,

To briefly answer your questions, we are contemplating another layer of 
documents with the EPC contract.  There will also be a Development Agreement 
that outlines our development activities and our nonrefundable fee.  I don't 
read his comments to mean he only wants one EPC contract.  Let's discuss 
tomorrow.  Also, we've told Bob Wright that if the plants don't work, the 
state gets its money back.  I think he and everyone involved would be 
amenable to a performance band provided that a comparable reduction in price 
accompanies the reduced performance (to the 10 percent floor, of course).  
This LOI outlines the EPC contracts only.  The Development Agreement will 
cover our fee.  So, no, our fee is not at risk for the fuel cells failing to 
perform.  We will have some risk on BOP if the plants fail.

What time works for everybody?  How about 9:30?

Heather

Hi guys,

In looking at CRRA's comments to the draft LOI. I have these questions:

1.  I'm not sure what we mean by EPC contract.  Is this referring to the Fuel 
Cell document we are working now, or is there to be another layer? I know 
this may depend on whether CRRA or someone else is doing the balance of the 
construction activities.

2.  He expects one EPC contract, and we had tried to leave room for multiple 
contracts. Does anyone care?

3.  Does CRRA get a full refund of the purchase price if the fuel cells fail 
the performance tests?  We have discussed with FCE the concept of a 
proportional reduction if the performance is within 10 percent, then a full 
reduction as to the failing unit(s) only.  Also, are we planning to mark up 
the fuel cell contract to recover our fee?  Is our fee at risk for the fuel 
cells failing to perform? 

Thanks,

Kay

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Federal energy regulators may investigate whether =
the operator of California's wholesale electricity market has been manipula=
ting its power-purchasing practices to reduce the costs of power the state =
purchased under long-term contracts, according to documents obtained Friday=
 by Dow Jones Newswires Friday.=20

At issue is whether the California Independent System Operator has violated=
 its own market rules by purchasing expensive power secured by the state un=
der contracts rather than cheaper power available in the spot market. The s=
tate's need to sell off surplus power secured under those contracts has pro=
ven embarrassing for Gov. Gray Davis, who signed $43 billion in deals to he=
ad off a summer of spiking prices and blackouts that never materialized.=20

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will hold a meeting in California =
Monday to address generators' complaints. The energy companies say that the=
 California ISO's purchasing decisions are difficult to comprehend and out =
of line with the market, according to a letter sent by Andrea Wolfman, lead=
 FERC counsel for market oversight and enforcement.=20

The letter was sent to the ISO, the California Department of Water Resource=
s - which has been buying power in lieu of the state's struggling utilities=
 since mid-January - and several generators, all of which were to attend th=
e meeting.=20

""Recently we have become concerned that the scheduling and dispatch procedu=
res of the California ISO, as they have had to change in the last nine mont=
hs, are not well understood or are not well suited to the current market st=
ructure,"" Wolfman said in her letter. ""The purpose of the meeting is to dev=
elop agreement between the ISO and those that participate in the scheduling=
 and dispatch (generators, utilities, CDWR) on appropriate practices and pr=
ocedures.""=20

ISO Procedures Need Explaining -FERC=20

The ISO's main responsibility is keeping power supply and demand in balance=
 on the state's electrical grid. As part of that job, the ISO determines wh=
ich power plants to call into service and which suppliers to buy power from=
.=20

If the ISO can't explain how it makes its decisions, FERC may conduct an au=
dit of the organization and investigate the possibility it has manipulated =
the market, Wolfman's office said.=20

""As discussed, FERC may schedule a technical conference and operational aud=
it of CAISO,"" a second letter from FERC's market oversight and enforcement =
division states. ""This unprecedented examination of CAISO operations could =
lead to the belief that complaints by generators of market manipulation and=
 other practices by the ISO should be investigated.""=20

The ISO's operating rules generally call for it to purchase the cheapest po=
wer first.=20

""The information that (generators) have provided all leads to a theory that=
 the CAISO is manipulating the market in order to purchase surplus DWR powe=
r at high prices and protect Gov. Davis from political embarrassment,"" the =
second letter says.=20

The ISO has said only that the market isn't operating as intended, and decl=

ns, the ISO is letting DWR supply expensive power into the market as ""out-o=
f-market"" purchases that aren't averaged into the real-time prices that ISO=

DWR continues to buy out-of-market power regularly at the ISO's request, DW=

he ISO's August market report, the average out-of-market price for peak hou=
rs was $55.90 a megawatt-hour, compared with $26.49/MWh on the ISO computer=
ized market. Brokered prices of western electricity have been lower than th=
e out-of-market prices for months.=20

None of the companies mentioned was willing to comment on the record.=20

The meeting is scheduled to be held at the ISO's headquarters in Folsom, Ca=
lif., and representatives from power producers, utilities and the state are=
 expected to attend. FERC will serve as facilitator, Wolfman said. The meet=
ing isn't open to the public.=20

The meeting will begin with a presentation by the ISO on its practices and =
operational procedures, followed by adjustments that may be needed to impro=
ve the market.=20

""The objective is to develop a written set of procedures that is agreed to =
by all the market participants and that is consistent with good utility pra=
ctices,"" Wolfman said in the letter.=20

Good Morning! Yes, that's the big girls. But, she's not as tall as the 
picture makes her look. The player standing right behind her is only 5 feet
tall. Some of the other girls are only about my height. There's a reason why
we encourage her to play softball and not volleyball. If genetics means
anything, I think her build will be more along the softball player lines! It
may also be the angle the picture was taken.

I think Annie is probably getting close to 5 feet tall, but I wouldn't swear
on it. Probably 4'10"" or so.

Have a good morning!

Love you!

Sara and I met with Mark today to talk in part about the concerns I had about 
the HDD info that third parties had requested us to provide.  He wants us to 
talk to you and the group further about this because there are risks 
associated with us giving this info to third parties if a portion of such 
info is info that we fill in based on our internal knowledge.  I'm out 
tomorrow and this afternoon is hectic so I would very much like to have this 
discussion at our Monday morning meeting.  does everyone on your side know

18th but my nephew will be staying at my house and maybe my mom and neice

dude. I only have dinner plans for the 18th. There is a Mardi Gras party to
go to on the 17th thrown by the No Le Hace bunch. Let me know if you are
coming into town.

Are you dating anyone? I am dating a young thing named Heather. She is
really cool.

The house is looking good. They are doing brick work on the front as we

Hope to here from you.

"That's the right story.  Only thing I'd be prepared for is the following, 
""OK, Mr. Belden, California's stupid, they did it wrong, and your company 
told them so right at the outset.  Does that give you the right to rob 
California's consumers and businesses blind?""  

Regarding the story with Peace quoted saying ""we exported our stranded costs 
out of state.""  I recall seeing that story on several occasions.  Karen, do 
we have someone who can do a search (lexis/nexis) and find those articles?  
Shouldn't be too tough.

I am giving a speech in Santa Fe in a couple of weeks.  One of the points 
that I want to make is that California set up the rules, made a strategic bet 
to go short, decided to buy all of their power on the spot market, and is now 
crying that their massive bet didn't work.  I remember reading an article in 
the San Diego Tribune from sometime in 1998 or 1999 with a quote from Steve 
Peace.  Peace talked about how the state of California ripped off a bunch of 
dumb out of state generators and wisely solved their stranded cost problem.  
Does anybody remember this article?  Does anybody have this article?  Is 
there a service that we can use to find it if we don't have it?  Let me know.

July 20 was not effective to bind ECT.  Please confirm this with Sara and

"Chris,

We won't have any site specific technical info, so we will  have to fly 
without it.  I know that seems strange, but there is no designated site for 
this equipment as of now.

Here's co#1:



Each of these units has one dual fuel option.

The master list of serial numbers is in this document:




We use the unit serial numbers as opposed to turbine or generator serial 
numbers.  I'm sending you the whole enchilada since this is a handy reference.

I agree with adding 25% of the cost of the dual fuel option to the January 
payment.  Unit 17  to company 1 is fine.  The maximum liability price (or 
whatever we call it) will be the base price allocation, plus the dual fuel 
option amount.

Good question on the retention.  I guess we should set it up as if each is in 
a stand alone project. As far as I know they may be intending to put these at 
separate sites.

I'll get back to you on the fax and contract reference number.

Thanks,

Kay

Hello Everyone,

We've gotten word back from Jim Fallon to go forward with obtaining CLEC 
licenses.  This brings us to the next set of questions:

Which entity do we license?  EBS or ETI?
If we license ETI as a CLEC, can we transfer EBS' IXC licenses to ETI?
Do we get CLEC licenses in all states, or some strategic subset of states?

I'd like to put together a group to address these questions, working with 
legal, tax, and commercial people.  Please let me know if you are interested 
in participating in this group.  It most likely will involve a fairly 
intensive schedule of meetings in Houston during December.

We should hold off on filing new IXC license applications until we have 
resolved the EBS vs. ETI issue.  For states where an EBS IXC license 
application currently is pending, let's not be too aggressive in pushing 
those applications forward over the next month.  Give me a call if this 
creates a problem in any of your states.  Also, Scott, please let everyone 
know if there are any fiber-build states where you think the delay would be a 
problem.

Feel free to give me a call if you have any questions.

Sue

"Jeff Dasovich and I, along with several IEP members, met with Gov Davis'=20
staff today, including his Chief of Staff, his Staff Director and two polic=
y=20
advisors on energy issues.  They made the following points:

The Governor is personally spending a great deal of time on electricity=20
issues (and is forcing them to spend their time on it as well).
The Governor recognizes that part of the problem is a supply shortage, but=
=20
they put special emphasis on the view that in addition to supply shortfalls=
,=20
a big part of the problem is a ""dysfunctional market"" -- a thinly veiled=20
reference to price manipulation by people sitting in the room.
The Governor's view is that all participants (regulators, utilities,=20
customers and generators) must ""behave responsibly"".
Everyone must ""share the pain"".
The legislative battles are likely to start as soon as the legislature=20
returns next week, and the Governor will be putting forth several legislati=
ve=20
proposals in the next couple of weeks.
While staff went out of its way to say that the list of proposals (in the=
=20
attached e-mail) were unofficial and for discussion purposes only, it was=
=20
fairly clear that they defined much of what the governor plans to propose.

The meeting was not very encouraging nor did it provide much in the way of=
=20
new information.  The IEP group was on message, making the usual arguments=
=20
about the need for forward contracting, expedited generation and transmissi=
on=20

staff is clearly focussed on forward contracting as part of the solution bu=
t=20
remains committed to the idea that generators have to cough up some money a=
nd=20
remain subject to rate caps, possible restrictions on sales outside the sta=
te=20
(at least at peak times), etc.  One approach they appear to be toying with =
is=20
a ""share the pain"" proposal which would have utilities absorbing some of th=

deferred costs and consumers absorbing some of the deferred costs in the fo=
rm=20
of higher rates.  That leaves generators ... who they might want to either=
=20
agree to some refunds or provide power at lower going-forward prices.

The staff says that they remain open to proposed solutions, but the Davis=
=20
administration appears unwilling to spend any political capital to fix the=
=20
problem. =20

I think we are in for a lengthy legislative and PUC fight.  We should, as=

"John:  The ""signature block"" for ENA and ECT Investments, Inc. trades done 
through the U.K. agent actually looks different.  It should read something 
like ""Company X, as agent for ENA"", for example.  Therefore, Insitnet needs 
to see the agency agreement between Company X and ENA (which is in the 
process of being drafted).  You are correct in that the original ENA/Instinet 
agreement will be utilized.  However, Instinet needs to review the agency 
arrangement before proceeding.

You are also correct about the ITG agreement.  In fact, ENA DOESN'T have an 
executed agreement with POSIT.  I spoke with the POSIT lawyer several months 
ago and was shocked that the service would operate without anything in 
writing.

Thanks.  Sara

Sara,

As ENA and ECT Investments, Inc., will be the entities where all trades are 
actually booked, I would not think that any new agreements would need to be 
signed between the new ""agent"" entitiy and any outside vendors (ie, brokers, 
online trading platforms, etc.)  The new entity will never take actual 
ownership of the securities.  Therefore, I would presume that the Instinet 
agreement should just be an addendum to existing documentation.  The 
Posit/ITG agreement will have to be an entirely new agreement because the 
ownership structure of ITG Europe is different than that of the States.  This 
agreement, however, should reflect exactly the same sort of 
structure/language as was used to negotiate the contract between ITG and ENA 
and ECT Investments, Inc. 

Please let me know your thoughts.

Thanks and regards,
John

		 Subject: Re: Cash Collateral


Dear Carol

Under Bermuda law, there is no real concept of ""perfecting"" security since it 
is not necessary to ensure the enforceability in Bermuda that a charge be 
registered in Bermuda.  However, although it is not necessary for a security 
interest to be registered in order for it to be valid, the charge document 
itself can be registered in Bermuda in the Register of Charges in accordance 
with Section 55 of the Companies Act 1981 in order to ensure the priority in 
Bermuda of the charge.  On registration, any charge evidenced in the charging 
document will have priority over any unregistered competing charge or any 
subsequently registered competing charge in respect of the assets which are 
the subject of the charge (i.e. the cash).

If the agreement will be governed by either Texas or New York law, it will be 
a matter of the laws of either Texas or New York as to the actual nature of 
the security interest which is created by the charge.

If you would like us to effect the registration of the charge, we would need 
an original (or a certified true copy) of the executed document which creates 
the security interest.  There is no time limit on such registration.  
However, please note that, in addition to our professional fees, there is a 
filing fee of $446 which is payable in respect of the registration.

I trust that the above is of some assistance.  If you have any questions 
please do not hesitate to contact me.

Kind regards.

"THE LEGISLATURE
No material change from the last update.  
The Legislature is in recess and the two bills that passed the Senate--SB 78 and SB 18--continue to sit in the Assembly, waiting for the Assembly to return on August 20th.
Support for the two bills in Assembly is currently very weak.
A handful of Democratic Assembly legislators and staff have been meeting over the recess to determine whether they can 1) reach agreement on the bill that the Assembly's been working on (AB 82), and 2) reach agreement with the Democrats in the Senate.
We will distribute the output of those meetings as soon as it is available.
The key features of SB 78 would: 
allow Edison to recover $2.5 of the $3.5 B of payables. 
earmark the $2.5 B to pay the banks and the QFs.  
leave Edison to figure out how to cover the remaining $1B in payables to suppliers (including Enron).
single out the largest business customers to pay for 100% of the $2.5 B in payables.
give the State the option to buy Edison's transmission assets at book.
do nothing to ensure Direct Access is maintained.
The key features of AB 82 would:
maintain a week form of Direct Access, though the bill doesn't go nearly far enough with respect to DA.
adopt some of SB 78's the onerous features (e.g., no authorization to pay back suppliers; force the biggest business customers to pay down Edison's debt to the banks and QFs).
The key features of SB 18 would:
restructure the way in which the upcoming bond issuance is financed by creating a ""dedicated utility rate component"" (i.e., a fixed charge) to service the bonds.
de-link payments to suppliers holding DWR contracts from payments to service the bonds to pay back the General Fund.
allow the PUC to hold a public hearing on DWR's contracts.

A consortium of small and large businesses and business associations sent a strongly worded letter today to Davis and all members of the CA Legislature expressing extreme opposition to both 78 and 82.  I have a copy of the letter and will distribute to anyone who would like to see it.
In the same letter, the business consortium strongly supports SB 18 because they fear they will get stuck with any out-of-the-money DWR contracts.
The consortium is lobbying hard to have the DWR contracts nullified or re-negotiated.
The Treasurer and the Governor oppose SB 18 because they believe 1) it would constitute contract breach, and 2) the contract provisions require the state to pay the present value of the contract plus LD in the event of a breach.
Calpine, who holds about 50% of the DWR contract volume, is also opposed to SB 18.
Opposition to any form of ""Edison bailout"" is increasing among policy makers, opinion leaders and the press
There is currently a 50-50 or better chance that the Legislature will NOT pass an Edison MOU before the session ends, though that could change.

THE CALIFORNIA PUC
Since the legislature has failed to pass comprehensive legislation addressing CA's crisis, the issues now revert back to the PUC.
In particular, the PUC is slated to rule on August 23rd on whether Direct Access should be suspended.
The Treasurer has said that DA must be suspended in order to remove any risk that DA might create with respect to impairing the revenue stream necessary to service the bonds.
AB 1X, the law that authorized DWR to buy power, gives the PUC the authority to suspend Direct Access.
Enron is leading a large group of customers and suppliers in an effort to stop the PUC from suspending Direct Access.
The group is writing a letter to Davis, the PUC, the Treasurer, DWR and the Legislature urging them to maintain Direct Access.
That letter should be released Friday or Monday.
The group is also making a submission to the PUC as early as Monday to provide the Commission with practical alternatives that would permit the the PUC to maintain Direct Access.
The group is also mounting a PR campaign that it wil launch simultaneously with the release of the letter and the submission to the PUC.
Currently, the chances that the PUC will suspend Direct Access on the 23rd is better than 50 percent, but a considerable effort is underway to reverse the situation.

		 Subject: New Canadian Lawyer

Janette - Can you call Sharon to co-ordinate 5-10 minutes when Mark is 
available to discuss the attached.

Mark -  I want to discuss with you a candidate, with the following background 
information.  Sorry for the long memo but it might make our discussion more 
efficient.

I wanted to see if I could recruit someone with 4-6 years major law firm 
experience and whom I knew or could confirm by my contacts as having a 
reputation as a quality lawyer and person with broad corporate and commercial 
experience.  Perhaps I am getting too far removed from that level, but I was 
able to come up with only one candidate that I think is worthy of pursuing.  
If he proves unsatisfactory, I will then have to go to an 
out-placement/recruitment agency, which is relatively expensive.  That said 
the candidate I am suggesting would to my mind be as good or better than any 
candidate that we may find through a formal recruitment process.  His name is 
Derek Flaman.  I will send his resume to you by fax.

A couple of points:

Strengths:

(a)  Derek comes from the Donahue Ernst and Young firm and to my knowledge is 
a highly regarded commercial associate.

(b)  Prior to that he was at Macleod Dixon and a highly regarded commercial 
associate there.  The Managing Partner of Donahue Ernst and Young Calgary 
came from Macleod Dixon Calgary and brought Derek over with him.

(c)  Derek has never done any work for us, but I have met him socially a 
number of times and have spoken to him about this job possibility.  I think 
he has a down-to-earth and comfortable personality that would suit the 
atmosphere and stresses of Enron well.

(d)  Derek was seconded internally to Husky Oil - one of DEY's major Calgary 
clients - for a period and has experince in-house.  He worked for an internal 
lawyer at Husky who is a friend of Greg Johnston and who gave excellent 
reviews.

(e)  Although I do not have his law school grades, he tells me he finished in 
the top third of his class at Queens University - which among the reputable 
schools in Canada.

(f)  He is qualified both under Alberta and Ontario law.

(g)  He has met with Milnthorp and Greg Johnston, both of whom were favorably 
impressed.

Issues:

(a)  Derek graduated from law school in '94 and since that time his career 
has been a bit traveled.  Although there is an explanation, his continuous 
experience at Macleod Dixon and Donahue Ernst and Young started in '97.  
Before that the history is he is from a small town in Alberta.  After 
graduating he wanted to work at a small firm in Toronto and had an interest 
in labor law, and spent his first year articling to a Toronto labor 
boutique.  After that year he wanted to get into commercial work and out 
Toronto, and moved to Fraser Milner in Edmonton.  His wife then took a 
position at Stikeman Elliott in Calgary however, and so he moved to Macleod 
Dixon in Calgary.  He moved to Donahue Ernst and Young when they established 
their office in Calgary.  All things being considered, I am comfortable with 
his experience at say a 4 to 5 year level - although compensation could then 
be an issue (I have not discussed compensation with him).

(b)  Derek's experience has been primarily in large commercial projects, 
especially the off-shore oil and gas developments in Hibernia and Terra Nova 
for Husky.  This would require some very good legal and large project 
organizational skills but is obviously different from a faster paced, 
commercially oriented, higher volume trading atmosphere.  In his secondment 
to Husky however he was more involved in their retail gasoline business and 
natural gas marketing and,  although I am sure not the atmosphere at Enron, 
he tells me it is an atmosphere he is comfortable with and enjoys.

(c)  Do Jim Derrick's accounting/law firm concerns apply to hiring a lawyer 
(as opposed to retaining counse)?

I would like to get back to Derek soon to discuss next steps (interview in 
Houston? with whom? Vicki Sharp? get a feel for compensation expectations?), 
or look to other alternatives.

Peter.

Here are my comments to the form of Guranty:

1. I thought that this Guaranty would only cover the Engage US Agreement.

2. What cap number do you plan to insert in Section 1(c)?  I'm assuming $10M 
if the Guaranty only covers Engage US.

3. In Section 6, there should be no restriction on our ability to assign our 
rights under the Guaranty in connection with any assignment of the swap that 
is done in accordance with the Master Agreement.  The restriction should only 
be on the Guarantor's right to assign.

Dear Sara & Cheryl,

I have been asked by our affiliate in Geneva, Cargill
International, S.A. (""CISA""), to begin negotiations for
them on an ISDA Master Agreement with Enron.

There had been some question as to which Enron entity
was to enter into an ISDA with CISA, but the latest
information they had (possibly from someone in an Enron
office in London?) was that it should be Enron Capital
& Trade Resources International Corp.  FYI, Cargill
International, S.A. is located and incorporated in Geneva.

Could you kindly advise whom I should be contacting to
confirm this is indeed the proper Enron entity and with
whom I should be speaking to begin negotiations?  Please
also let me know if there is anything that needs to be
done from a Credit or Trading perspective in order to
get this ISDA started on Enron's part.

1. Why did we exclude the Federal power marketing administrations, TVA, 
etc.?  Are those facilities regulated in a different section?

2. Why do we limit the FERC's authority (on pg 8) from regulating 
""transmission in intrastate commerce""?  This is a loophole that could be 
abused by many parties.

3. I am very concerned about the ""independence"" language (pg 10).  Today NERC 
has an ""independent"" Board of Trustees that is elected by the Stakeholders.  
Would NERC meet this criteria?  If it would, then the lanaguage needs to be 
strenghthened.  

4. We should add something that authorizes the FERC to implement a 
""Reliability Standards Fee"" onto each Transmission Provider.  One of the key 
problems with NERC today is that the funding vehicle still resides with the 
Regional Councils and therefore with the IOUs.  The NERC Board of Trustees 
has no method to raise funds except to get approval of the Stakeholders.  
This will become the key problem very soon.  The total NERC budget is $12 MM 
/ year.  This is nothing if allowed into rates.

Thanks,

Jim

"Nick,

The plan is OK, subject to unforeseen complications.
My flight from London was delayed and I had to spend a night in Newark, NJ.
My schedule for today was disrupted and I had to postpone my departure till 
Friday
morning. I should be at San Francisco around 10:00 a.m. if there is no delay.
I should be able to meet you at noon at your office. 

Please, confirm the meeting both to my office E-mail address and my private 
address
(vkaminski@aol.com). Can you give me the phone number
at which I can reach you on Friday if there is a delay?

Look forward to meeting you.

Vince

Subject: Litigation Counsel Approval - Lakeside Packers

We have a counterparty (Lakeside Packers) who refuses to perform to a 5 year 
fixed for floating power swap which commenced Jan. 01 and is C$2.5MM 
(US$1.7MM) in the money to us and booked (we would take a hit to earnings by 
that amount to unwind the deal).  Unfortunately, without the involvement of 
Legal, the deal was executed without paper, but on the basis that it was 
subject to our standard ISDA documentation.  The Confirm was sent out on that 
basis but not executed by the counterparty.  There was some agreement on 
guarantee support, but as this was less clear to get the underlying deal put 
in place, with the approval of Credit, we gave up the requirement for the 
guarantee in our subsequent discussions and demand letter.

We want to pursue the matter by commencing litigation.

Lakeside is traditionally represented by Blakes.

My suggestion would be to use the Duncan McCachen firm, a litigation boutique 
who we have used in the past (CIBC litigation).  Mike McCachen has a good 
understanding of the trading business for a litigation lawyer.  
Alternatively, I would suggest Clarke Hunter of Macleod Dixon who is 
currently representing us on the NGX litigation and who also has a good 
understanding of out trading business.  Mike is a little more aggressive than 
Clarke, to my preference.

We would like to proceed as soon as possible as our demand letter expired 
last week, and our calls this morning were not dealt with satisfactorily.

Peter.

"I heard today that Curtis Smith has resigned.  I am sure that both ot you 
know that Curtis and Jeremy Wong were viewed by users as critical resources 
for ERMS support.  Even at a stand still, my team had great concern over the 
rumored loss of Curtis and/or Jeremy.  And with the assumption that Sitara 
will not go forward for valuation, then ERMS really has become repositioned 
as one of our key, strategic systems.  There is much to do to ""catch up"", if 
you will, with changes and enhancements that were put on hold for several 
years during the Sitara development stage.  And our business continues to 
grow and change rapidly, requiring responsive enhancements on an on-going 
basis.   

I would like to get together to discuss the staffing plan for support of ERMS 
as soon as possible.   We need to understand how day-to-day production 
support will be managed and how development work will be effectively 
handled.  

I will ask my assistant to set up a meeting as soon as possible.  "

California; Metro Desk
Electricity Cost Data Spread the Blame Power: Many suppliers charged more than the firms that Davis has pilloried, records show.
RICH CONNELL; ROBERT J. LOPEZ; DOUG SMITH
TIMES STAFF WRITERS

07/10/2001
Los Angeles Times
Home Edition
B-1

SACRAMENTO -- California's energy meltdown involves a far more diverse group of wholesale electricity merchants than suggested by Gov. Gray Davis, who has aggressively blamed a handful of Texas companies, state records show. 
During the first three months of this year--one of the worst stretches of power shortages during the crisis--an assortment of public and private entities charged the state prices averaging well above some of those paid to Texas firms, according to documents released to The Times on Monday by the Department of Water Resources, which now buys power for California.
Among those setting and collecting some of the highest average prices per megawatt-hour were a Canadian public utility, a subsidiary of San Diego Gas & Electric's parent company, and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, the report shows. Their average prices ranged from $498 a megawatt-hour charged by Powerex, the trading arm of British Columbia's BC Hydro, to $292 an hour by the DWP. 
In fact, some of the biggest private power companies singled out for criticism by Davis and other state officials--Dynegy Inc., Duke Energy and Mirant--charged less than the average prices the state paid for the period. Those companies' average prices ranged from $146 to $240 per megawatt-hour, according to an analysis of the documents. 
The figures cover the various types of spot and longer-term power purchased by the state during three months that included rolling blackouts and more than a month of razor-thin reserves, leading to continuous power emergencies. 
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor has directed his sharpest barbs at private out-of-state generators because, in general, they have reaped the highest profits over the longest period. 
""You have to look at the whole picture,"" Maviglio said. 
""The governor was expressing his displeasure with the arrogance of the generators who wear cowboy hats,"" he said. ""Their profits were 100% to 400% above last year. . . . Just because there are other entities who are charging us more [per megawatt-hour] doesn't change the fact that we are getting ripped off by companies from Houston, Tulsa, Atlanta or Charlotte."" 
The report by the Department of Water Resources was provided to The Times on the same day the state released 1,700 pages of documents on California's electricity purchases on the volatile spot market for the year's first quarter. 
The records detail how the state spent nearly $8 billion buying power in the first five months of the year, and underscore the complexity of the state's energy problem. They also show that patterns of high prices are not limited to a few generators. 
Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the water resources agency, said that the reports together show that prices were extremely volatile early in the year. ""All the prices were high,"" he said, noting the downward trend in costs since his agency began buying power in mid-January. 
The average price per megawatt-hour for all state purchases went from $316 in January to $243 in May. Spot prices fell from an average of $321 per hour to $271, the reports show. 
In the first quarter of the year, some public entities' prices far exceeded those of the biggest private companies. For example, Houston-based Enron, one of the nation's biggest power traders, charged an average of $181 per megawatt-hour. And Atlanta-based Mirant, which sold the most to the state, a total of $706 million, charged an average of $225 per megawatt-hour. 
By contrast, a Calgary, Canada, firm, TransAlta Energy, averaged $335 a megawatt-hour, and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District had average charges of $330 per megawatt-hour. 
A spokesman for Enron, Mark Palmer, said recently that the ""vilification of Enron was based on politics, not facts."" Spokesmen for BC Hydro could not be reached late Monday to comment on its huge sales to the state. In the past, the utility has defended its pricing practices, saying it has offered last-minute hydroelectric power that helped keep California's lights on. 
A spokeswoman for Sempra, the parent company of San Diego Gas & Electric, said late Monday the company was unable to comment because it had yet to see the figures released by the state. Officials at DWP, who could not be reached Monday evening, have defended their pricing, saying the costs of producing the power needed by the state were extremely high. 
More Power Bought Than Projected 
Hidalgo, of the Department of Water Resources, said his agency's efforts, coupled with conservation by business and consumers and falling natural gas prices, have begun to tame the state's market. 
Still, the state had to purchase $321 million in power in April and May, about 10% more than Davis' analysts had projected. 
Hidlago said that was because of hot weather in May and other supply problems in April. He said reports will show that power purchases fell short of state projections in June and early July. 
The reports also will show that prices paid by the state were down in June and July, partly because spot prices have fallen sharply, often to well under $100 a megawatt-hour. 
A summary Department of Water Resources report released Monday credited Davis' program of nurturing new power generation and establishing long-term power contracts with with ""moving the California electric energy industry closer to normalcy.""

I will be on the first panel of the FERC California conference on Thursday.  
The format allows a 5 min presentation and then 60 min of Q&A.  I need your 
help to make sure I have ""Gore-like"" command of the details.  Please help 
with the following information:
Enron project information (Parquet/McCubbin) -- please give me any 
presentations or summaries you have on the generation, or firm purchases, we 
have under way (or planned).  I'll talk with you to find out what we are 
comfortable disclosing but please err on the side of giving whatever 
information you have.
Updated Belden presentation (Hain/Belden) -- I believe the latest information 
was as of August; I think some of the information on the cost of peaking 
facilities is particularly eye-opening on the price cap issue.
Comparison to PJM (Hartsoe/Novosel) -- Is the information we are seeking from 
the ISO and PX similar to information PJM already provides?  If so, it would 
be nice to tie our requests back to something the Commission has already 
approved.
Cancelled DSM projects (Mahoney) -- Again, I'll only use what we feel 
comfortable with, but it would help make our point if we can give examples of 
how price caps backfire when it comes to encouraging conservation.
ISO/PX reports (Dasovich).  I have the ISO market surveillance report.  Is 
there another ISO report?  If so, please get me a copy and provide a copy of 
the PX report too.
CEC/Proposed generation update (Mara/Parquet) -- Need the basic information: 
proposed, waiting for permitting; how much/little the legislation did to 
expedite siting (ie are we still comfortable saying that it applies to less 
than 10%)?
Soft cap(Belden/Hain) -- need a crisp explanation of why the ""soft"" nature of 
the cap is not sufficient.  Also, would we be OK if the Commission revised it 
to say that bids can be taken above 150 without special filing or reporting 
requirements, but those bids will be accepted at the price bid rather than 
applying to all lower bids as well (ie the highest bid at or below 150 clears 
the market, bids above 150 accepted at price bid as needed)?
Offers we have made/deals done (Parquet/Dasovich/ Mccubbin) -- Roseville plus 
any others, offer made to SDG&E -- I want to make the point that the market 
will provide solutions (below the retail price cap) if we get the utility 
(and the regulators) out of the merchant function.
Herding the cats(Hartsoe/mccubbin/mara/dasovich):  We are asking FERC to be 
courageous, do the right thing and ignore the politics.  To be even halfway 
credible, we can't have IEP, EPSA, Dynegy or anyone else ""squishing"" on the 
price cap issue..  We have never been closer to reform in California, we need 
these guys on board.
Thanks.

"Attached is the consolidated list of counterparties for the week ending 
12/3.  All other lists sent to you by various people this week can be 
ignored.  If a counterpartys says ""declined"" by Credit, you don't need to 
look at it.  If there is nothing in the box it means ""approved"" and, as of 
today, look at ""divisions"" which means they are trading out of a division  
The ""division"" issue is up in the air and is being looked at on a going 
forward basis.

Per my agreeement with each of the physical groups, IF I DO NOT HEAR FROM YOU 
IN ONE DAY, I WILL ASSUME THE COUNTERPARTY IS APPROVED TO TRADE ALL THE 
PRODUCTS THAT CREDIT HAS APPROVED FOR THAT COUNTERPARTY.  We rarely expect 
counterparty issues from the physical trading groups, most of the 
counterparty issues will be with the financial trading counterparties.  I 
ONLY NEED TO HEAR FROM YOU IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH A COUNTERPARTY.

Most of the physical trading group's issues will revolve around which 
contract to use, and that should be resolved directly with Global Contracts, 
in the same way you resolve such issues on an ""off-line"" basis.

Credit is redoing the 12/6 and 12/7 lists they sent to me earlier, and I will 
forward them to you as soon as I receive them.

"I think there is a real possibility here.  It would be extremely challenging commercially.

How do we convince customers to participate?
Two distinct areas:  (i) Existing portfolio of business and (ii) New business.

New business is easier in one sense since everything is at the money, who would say no to a AAA credit?  Still requires significant amendment to existing trading documentation and where existing trades are present, separating them out as not netting with new trades.

Existing business is easy for counterparties who are already in the money -- they will want the improved credit.  But how do we convince the out of the money side of the equation to participate?  This seem to me to be the biggest hurdle.


Issues:

Requires consent of customers and significant amendment of existing contracts.
	Adequate incentive for customers currently out of the money to participate?
	Might make more sense where no current positions exist.
	
Contract hurdles:

	Need to allow for termination by defaulting party so Enron (VMAC) will be able to control termination on default.
	Need the consent of counterparty to assign contract to VMAC.
	May require changing permitted credit support from counterparties (letters of credit probably don't work).

If we are attempting to put an existing book of business into the structure, an initial chunk of money will have to be given to VMAC to secure the existing out of the money side of the portfolio - how much is it and do we have that money?

It's not clear how the proposal allows for credit lines to and from counterparties.  That is, if we have given an aggregate $200 million credit line to out of the money counterparties and have only been given an aggregate $100 million credit line to in the money counterparties, will VMAC be satisfied with the mismatch.  Will we continue to control the amount of credit we give to customers?  If we go to 100% collateral requirements for all participating transactions, this is solved since there can't be a mismatch.  (Will customers agree to 100% collateral requirements - i.e. no credit lines?)

Once the supported/participating portfolio is out of the money, Enron will have to post collateral to VMAC.  If we fail, VMAC can default all participating/supported contracts.  

When all of the contracts are terminated with Enron as the defaulting party, the payments to and from counterparties are calculated on their side of the market.  Presumably VMAC will require some cushion to cover this.

Subject:	VMAC Transaction 

Louise and John:

Here is a general description of the transaction we are negotiating with VMAC (Virtual Markets Assurance Corporation)-FSA (Financial Securities Assurance). FSA is an AAA rated insurance company large enough to provide us with a credible deal.  

Here are the deal highlights:

FSA would wrap Enron's credit exposure as follows:

1) In case of default FSA would liquidate the contracts sleeved to them by Enron and use the proceeds of in the money transactions to pay for out of the money transactions.

2) In case Enron is out of the money in the portfolio of trades sleeved to VMAC. FSA would pay the counterparties with the 100% collateral previously posted by Enron and managed on a day to day basis.

FSA has mentioned the possibility of extending a line of credit to Enron based on its net collateral position (~$1.3 billion as of today) and the net mark to market position (~ $1.4 billion to date). Haircuts on the line of credit would have to be negotiated and might be significant.

FSA-VMAC would receive as compensation the fee structure described under terms and conditions. Under the current structure the only risk FSA- VMAC is exposed to is the risk of simultaneous default by Enron and another counterparty and the operational risk of marking to market the positions and liquidating the contracts. 

Please find enclosed the following:

1) Transaction structure : 	Describes the payment logic in case of default
2) Terms and conditions :	Describes the terms and conditions under negotiation for the contract
3) Collateral Haircuts : 		Describes the collateral haircuts on the securities posted to FSA to guarantee our net mark to market position (if out of the money)
4) FSA snapshot
5) FSA rating: 			AAA qualification of FSA by Moody's

Mark,

Thanks for your note.  It's a common misconception that we will be mostly 
working on asset disposition.  Our focus will be on the efficient operation 
of the assets, cleaning up problems, finishing projects etc.  The sales 
efforts will be conducted through Cliff Baxter's group with support from us.  
So, I don't believe that  I will need the type of effort that you believe 
David can provide and I have no other need for him at this juncture.  Cliff 
may feel that he has the need for David.  By the way, my experience with 
David when he worked for APAChi was that he had not learned much about the 
business and therefore was not terribly helpful to us as we were 
restructuring the group or when we were in a build mode in Thailand.

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Regards,
Rebecca

Subject: regulatory support

With your new organisation, I expect that you will have issues that will 
require support from my team, covering everything outside the Americas (Rick 
Shapiro providing support in the Americas).  Any thoughts either of you have 
regarding what your requirements might be would be helpful.  My understanding 
is that a fair bit of your effort will be focussed on asset disposition.  If 
that is correct, I want to run one idea by you.  We still have David Merrill 
posted as an expat in Singapore.  He is not working out as support for EBS 
(totally new field to him).  What are your thoughts on David returning to the 
energy arena, and focussing on flying around, as appropriate, to meet with 
various governments, working to secure necessary approvals, as/when/if 
needed?  Seems to fit his skill sets, based on prior government experience 
that he has.  

A second person who could also fill this role, though he is looking at other 
opportunities within Enron and may not be available, is Mike Dahlke.  
Thoughts on this person for this role?

Athough I know that PECO had a variety of questions about the interplay
of the FERC transmission policies and the force majeure definition at
the Nov. 18 meeting, I think we should keep the Houston session focussed
on the Products definitions first, and only deal with the force majeure
definition as it relates to the other products definitions.  If PECO
wants to continue to explore the transmission points, or other FERC
policy points they no doubt will, but I don't think they go on the
agenda, and certainly not first.
I think it would be very important to attach current products
definitions to the agenda, and would therefore plead with Liz and Marty
to see if we can get those implemented and to Andy for distribution by
Friday.  Also, Mitch Dutton was the one with custody of the System Firm
definition, and I will call him today to see if he can get it massaged
and to Andy by Friday morning.
  I'd love to have a discussion, with traders present, about the
bookout issue, but I don't know if we'll have time.  The other ""global""
issue that the traders need to focus on (and will no doubt want an
update on) is the status of the efforts to get FERC on board.  Andy, can
we at least give them tentatively that we WILL meet with FERC staff in
January, and the tentative dates of the rollout sessions on the contract
in Houston and New York?  PD

>>> <HEMU@dynegy.com> Tuesday, December 07, 1999 >>>
Please take a look at this and give me your thoughts.  One area that I
believe
needs more work in particular is the item referring to FERC policies; I
think
this is PECO's issue, but I'm not sure what FERC policies they are
concerned
about.

I would like to attach the current definitions of the products to the
agenda.
Do we have a definition of the ""Into __"" product that has been updated
since the
November 9 conference call?  Is there a new defintion of the ""Firm
(LD-System
Reliability)"" product?

What about trying to tackle bookouts if we have the time?  Is there
any
conceivable way we will have the time?

"Power providers cry foul over fees 
State is accused of improper billing 
Electricity suppliers long accused of manipulating California's energy market are turning the tables on the state, saying its independent grid manager is forcing them to make up the cost of bad energy deals signed by Gov. Gray Davis' administration. 
The power traders accuse the Independent System Operator -- which is legally required to act as an impartial market manager -- of improperly helping state power buyers spread out the cost of high-priced electricity contracts. 
Energy firms as well as municipal utility systems have complained about mysterious charges on their accounts with the grid agency, said Jan Smutney- Jones of the Independent Energy Producers Association, which represents such industry giants as Enron, Dynegy, Williams and Reliant. 
The charges showed up around the time the state Department of Water Resources was forced to start selling excess electricity it had purchased at an average of $69 per megawatt hour for as little as $1 per megawatt hour. 
""The ISO seems to be following specific instructions the Department of Water Resources is giving them,"" Smutney-Jones said. 
An industry source said NRG Energy Inc. and other suppliers were preparing a formal complaint to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which could order the state to issue refunds to generators if it finds they have been improperly charged. 
The commission has ordered an unprecedented operational audit of the grid management agency. 
State officials bought power under long-term contracts when it appeared California could suffer serious power shortages over the summer. Instead, the state had more than enough power, and electricity available on the spot market suddenly cost half as much as the energy California had bought. 
Gary Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum, an industry group, said the grid operator was using a combination of power scheduling and billing practices to ""bury"" some of the cost of power purchased by the state in the accounts of other generators. 
""The state is the biggest buyer and seller of electricity, and they control the governing board of the ISO,"" Ackerman said. 
The governor's spokesman, Steve Maviglio, called the power firms' accusations ""absolutely false"" and said the generators were trying to whip up sentiment in Washington to interfere with the state's affairs. 
""The generators know they'll get a much better deal at FERC headquarters in Washington than they will in Sacramento,"" Maviglio said. ""It shouldn't be a surprise that they make these accusations here to get federal involvement."" 
Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the Department of Water Resources, said generators could hardly cast themselves as victims in California's energy crisis. 
""I don't feel sorry for them one bit,"" Hidalgo said. ""They had one heck of a year."" 
Gregg Fishman, spokesman for the ISO said the agency was preparing a response to the accusations. 
Energy trade organizations said they suspected the ISO of using several mechanisms to charge suppliers for state contract costs. 
The extra expense is sometimes tacked on to suppliers' bills for ISO operating costs, which all electricity sellers in California share, Ackerman said. 
Some firms say they have tried to buy cheap spot market electricity for resale, only to find later that the grid manager has charged them for more expensive state power. Others say the grid operator orders them to activate stand-by power units on too-short notice. When they can't comply, they say, the ISO brings high-priced state power on line and bills them for the extra cost. 
The accusations are part of a struggle for control of California's grid. In January, Davis disbanded the ISO's 26-member governing board, which was chaired by Smutney-Jones, after some critics said it was too cozy with industry. Davis appointed his own five-member board. 
In February, then-FERC Chairman Curt Hebert said the new board had become ""a political arm of the governor."" The commission is trying to get California to turn over its grid to a multistate transmission organization. 
Davis has warned Washington to ""keep its hands off"" the ISO. "
"Shelley,

My colleague, Clayton Vernon, who has a background in  economics, wrote a 
short summary of arguments
against the ROFR. 

We are working on the second approach to the problem: we try to come up with 
a numerical estimate of the
value of this option. The fact that an incumbent shipper has this option has 
distributional consequences:
he has something  of value he never paid for. Having a numerical estimate of 
the value of this option
could help to argue against it. The value of such an option is case specific; 
so we shall rather 
produce a template you can use for valuation case by case.

Subject: auctions with an incumbent's right of first refusal

Vince-

Here is an essay on the issue you are discussing:


The Adverse Economic Impact of ""Rights of First Refusal""

An option to ""first refuse"" to match a competitor's offer is a restraint of 
free trade and an impediment to efficiency in the marketplace. This economic 
conclusion is unambiguous.

If an ""incumbent"" has the right to match an offer made by a competitor, for 
an item or service of value, then few competitors will invest the time and 
expense necessary to prepare and submit offers, those offers will be lower 
than they would have been otherwise, and the contract will often be awarded 
to an inefficient incumbent instead of a more efficient challenger.

In a traditional auction, where all bids are sealed and the item up for 
auction is awarded to the highest bidder, we can safely predict the item will 
be awarded to the bidder who values it the most, at a price reflecting the 
full value of the item up for auction.  This is the efficient result in a 
market economy, because the financing of the high bid reflects resources 
freely allocated to the high bidder.  If the auction has open bids, we can 
again safely predict the item to be awarded to the correct bidder, albeit at 
a slightly lower price to the donor of the item since the bidder with the 
highest valuation can simply increment by an infinitesimal amount the 
second-highest valuation.

Now, in a modified auction, where an incumbent bidder has the right to match 
the highest bid and retain the item for himself, each competing bidder must 
justify his own due diligence and bid preparation expenses against the 
following, and likely, scenario: the incumbent does not spend himself for due 
diligence, but instead uses these savings to help finance his matching the 
top bid from a competitor.

Simply put, the incumbent with a ""right of first refusal"" can be safely 
predicted to simply match their competitor's bid by ""rule of thumb."" But the 
incumbent's valuation of the item up for auction can be less than the 
valuation of the competitor, by the amount of the due diligence and 
administrative expenses.  And, the incumbent firm expropriates the expertise 
of his competitors, not only in their valuations themselves, a nontrivial 
financial exercise, but in any operational details required to be submitted 
along with the bid.

Furthermore, in an esoteric concept known as the ""Winner's Curse,"" a bidder 
realizes that if his bid actually prevails, if the incumbent fails to match 
it, he almost certainly overbid.

Given this, most competitors will not even bother to bid in an auction when 
an incumbent has the right of first refusal, and those that submit a bid do 
not rationally invest the time, expense and expertise necessary; they may 
just ""fire off"" a ""low-ball"" bid.  After all, in almost every conceivable 
""state of the world"" arising from the auction the competitors expect to lose 
money.  So, the incumbent almost always retains the contract at a 
below-market price, despite the incumbent not necessarily placing the highest 
value on the contract because the incumbent cannot put the contract to its 
most efficient use.

"Jeff,

I am sending you a recommendation regarding our cooperation with the Wharton
School, following my visit with Tom Piazze in May. Tom is a Corporate 
Relations Officer
at Wharton.

Recommendation.

I am writing to you to recommend joining The Wharton Partnership.
The Partnership is an umbrella program established to coordinate
Wharton School initiatives for industry-academic cooperation. Currently,
the partnership supports alliances with approximately  200 companies 
worldwide.

The recommended annual contribution by Enron is between $100K-150K,
that puts us in the top bracket of contributing companies, such as GE, 
Citigroup,
Goldman, Sachs & Co., Intel, and many others.  The contribution is executed 
through
grants to different research projects that would directly benefit Enron. The 
choice
of the projects is at our discretion and can be changed over time
depending on the business needs.

Benefits to Enron. 

Enron can benefit from the Partnership by:

 - gaining advance access to current academic research  
 - significantly increasing our presence  and visibility on the campus,
   enhancing   our recruiting efforts
 - taking our message directly to influential academics who have significant
                   influence on public opinion
        - gaining access to high quality executive education programs

Specific Programs.

The Partnership functions through involvement in different research projects. 
I have
identified a few projects that will maximize the benefit to Enron.

1. WeBI (Wharton e-Business Initiative). This programs provides an umbrella
    for different initiatives in the area of curriculum development, research 
and 
    corporate engagement related to e-commerce.

    Main benefits: access to e-commerce research and
    enhanced recruitment opportunities.

2. Emerging Technologies Management Research Program. Interdisciplinary
    program addressing issues facing companies in new markets: managing 
intellectual
    property, participating in emerging technologies, selecting the optimal
    organizational structures.

    Benefits to Enron: access to financial technology in the area of 
valuation of
    intangible assets and new forms of business organizations.

3. Risk Management and Decision Process Center. Development of techniques for
    assessment and management of non-traditional risks (risks outside the 
scope
    of traditional insurance contracts and capital markets instruments). 

    Benefits to Enron: access to new risk management tools, dissemination
    of information about our capabilities in this area.

Potential users of the program at Enron.

My group could coordinate the cooperation with the Risk Management and 
Decision Process Center.

Greg Whalley is a potential customer for WeBI. Several different units of 
Enron can be involved 
with  Emerging Technologies Management Research Program.

"Too late with your spreadsheet.  The instructions that we got from Donna were 
that I should review the resumes, pass them to Brent for his review, and then 
on to Causey for his review.  Considering our schedules and the large number 
of resumes to review, that would have been an impossible task to complete by 
Thursday at noon.  I received the resumes after lunch on Tuesday, just before 
leaving for the airport to catch the plane for Oklahoma.  I asked Patti to 
make a copy of the packet for Brent, and I knew that Rick would not want to 
take the time to review the resumes without some organization and screening 
first.  I reviewed as many of the resumes as I could on the plane on the way 
back to Houston today (all of the liberal arts resumes and about one third of 
the business resumes) and Brent reviewed them last night after his training 
class.  We got those to Rick today by noon, as he was leaving the office.  I 
believe that Rick will review what Brent and I put together and then will 
pass the resumes along to you.  Since you only e:mailed your spreadsheet this 
morning after Brent and I had done our reviews, you will have to 
cross-reference the info on the spreadsheet with the selected resumes.  

Brent and I would have appreciated some organization and screening of the 
resumes as well.  I would suggest that in the future that your team should 
make copies of the resumes for everyone that you would like to have doing the 
review.  The plan of passing them from one person to another is not 
practical,  and I should not have had to make the copies for Brent.  If you 
are going to ask VP's and MD's to help in this process in a very short time 
frame, then I would suggest that you use their time wisely.  If someone from 
you team had organized the resumes into three groups by GPA's or majors, that 
would have given us a good starting point, instead of a jumble of resumes.  
Two page resumes were not stapled together and there were a number of resumes 
of MBA's included, which should be considered for Associates interviews, not 
Analysts interviews.  Please give us organized information to react to, not 
simply a jumble of data that we have to weed through.  All of us want to 
participate and to be as involved as possible in the recruiting process, but 
we need to be able to rely on the Program for some basic administrative and 
organizational work.  

I send these suggestions with the intent of constantly bettering the program 
and with the intent of helping you to succeed in your role, not being 
critical.  I hope that you will take these suggestions in that light.   

Brent and I (and I am sure Hunter, too) would have appreciated "

"Tony

Wow I don't think so.   I thought I would rewrite yours and correct some of 
the factual errors.  If you disagree please write me back.

I moved from our Houston office in 1994 to Calgary and in 1999 was named 
President of the Canadian operation.  We went from a small gas marketing shop 
to the dominant natural gas trader and originator in Canada.  It was 
absolutely awesome.  I had the time of my life.  We built the business with 
very little supervision from Houston into a major contributor to Enron Corp's 
bottom line.  These days, as many people know, we are using the same trading 
and risk management skills that we learned in the energy business to create 
liquid tradable markets in bandwidth, pulp and paper, coal, and many others.  
So our newer people still have the chance to do what I did in Canada and help 
build revolutionary new businesses.

What a lot of people don't realize is how dominant our trading and risk 
management presence is in Natural Gas and Power.  The opportunities our 
outstanding and the challenges will test the best minds out there.  These 
businesses are interesting and very complicated with a million different 
variables to figure out ranging from the weather to the levels of gas storage 
in Montana to how to move power from New York to South Caralina.  You can't 
put gas and power on a truck or store them in a warehouse like other 
commodities.  Its not like trading bonds, where you sit around and try to 
figure out what the Fed is going to do.  It has much more complexity, and if 
you like trying to solve complex problems and your good at it.....get down 
here! .... we need you!

John's callout quote

Enron's not a place where you can hide.  If you can't get it done you won't 
fit in.  But if you can, and you work hard, you'll get noticed, you'll 
excell, you'll get paid, and we're going to love you.

"I would bet that we'll be there.  I'll bring my check book.  Is the 97 cab $32 retail?  If it is, it's worth it. 

With Barry doing what he did, getting to the playoffs was icing on the cake.  But, man, that Friday night game was a heart-breaker.

We'll see you Sunday!

I will order the wine tomorrow if you really will be by on Sunday.  I can
only have 2 cases delivered at a time.  So I'll get the Coastal first.  It
comes to $152.74 (less $80) = $72.74

The 97 cab will be $193.50
Total = $266.24

"Tim -- Cindy manages this program.
Mary -- please give some thought to how we might solicit employee views on 
this.
Cindy -- I believe we already allow matching of donations to quasi-religious 
organizations: religious schools, for example, and perhaps relief 
organizations like Catholic Relief Services?  I think that if we want to 
consider extending it we should probably discuss it in a smaller group than 
the e-speak forum --  the Enron Foundation Board perhaps?  This could become 
controversial, though (recall the Planned Parenthood debate and the periodic 
attempts of shareholders to add restrictions through the proxy mechanism).

"Lisa,  I feel so bad right now.  I never wanted anything but to be with you 
and love you the rest of my life.  I wish we knew how important it was to 
communicate with each other over the past years.  I think we are both guilty 
of not communicating.  It is easier to talk to some besides each other about 
certain things because of certain expectations or assumptions that have been 
built up over our portion of a lifetime together.  It hurts to now clearly 
understand this after things have happened.

I am scared of you moving in with Chris because I fear that we both may 
accept it as final.  I don't want it to be that and I want us to genuinely

Subject: Affiliate Relook case [PLEASE RESPOND TODAY]

Given everything that we've got on our plate, and the relative priority of 
the affiliate issue, and the fact that ARM and Wild Goose are involved, I 
would propose that we take a pass on this one.  Thoughts?

Best,
Jeff

Dear Jeff and Sue:

Sorry to be a broken record on this one....but I don't know what you want to
do about the Affiliates case.  There is a PHC tomorrow and comments were
filed.  SCE's comments make a nasty jab at Enron for proposing the rules in
the first place.  I see that AReM is participating as well.  If your plan is
to participate in this proceeding only through AReM, that's fine but please
let me know so that I can remove my appearance.  I will be at the PHC for
Wild Goose but would like to be very clear about who I am representing in
the docket in order to avoid confusion.  

Thanks,

Dear Band of Brothers!  (sorry...I'm reading Ambrose's book by the same name)

Scott Tholan and I thought it'd be cool to pull together the old Skunk Works crew for a reunion.  The goal of the meeting is to brainstorm data collection technologies and applications to better serve Enron customers -->> we want to get ahead of customer needs rather than forever being reactive to requirements blowing in from left field.  This is not necessarily about dreaming up whiz-bang technologies.  It's about pooling our knowledge of customer information gaps, and identifying old/new technologies to collect data that make our customers smarter and richer. 

 A steady flow margaritas would free the collective brainpower and creativity.  Who else is cleared into TAC programs and should be a part of this shindig?

Scott's out next week, so let's shoot for Tues, 11 SEP.  Let's say from 1500hrs until??  I'm serious about the margaritas.......

Any problems with this date/time?

Many thanks and looking forward to a good session!

SVMG ENERGY COMMITTEE MEMBERS, LIAISON REPRESENTATIVES & PRINCIPAL OFFICERS:

The California business community needs your help in opposing AB67 XX.  This
bill represents a dangerous attempt to rewrite SB78 XX, the Edison bail-out
legislation, which passed the Assembly last Friday.  After months of good
faith discussions the amendments the California Business Coalition so
strongly advocated for have been completely disregarded.  Direct Access
continues to be threatened and an unfair rate increase for large energy
users still lingers.

We urge you to contact your local delegation to express your opposition to
this inequitable legislation.  The Senate will be voting on SB67 XX
immediately.  If passed, the bill will go to the Assembly for vote tomorrow
morning.  Please contact members of both houses so that the concerns of the
California business community are clearly heard.

Attached please find the Business Coalitions floor alert, the SVMG's letter
opposing SB67 XX, as well as a spreadsheet with contact information for our
local legislative delegation.  Any effort in this regard will make a
difference.  Thank you for all of your help.

"Covisint Running Out of Excuses to Deliver on Its B2B Promise
By Joe Bousquin 
Staff Reporter
9/13/00 9:09 AM ET 
URL: http://www.thestreet.com/tech/internet/1076377.html
Uh-oh. Covisint can't blame it on the government anymore. 
When word came Monday that the Federal Trade Commission had green-lighted the 
Big Three automakers' Internet exchange, the business-to-business world 
breathed a collective sigh of relief. That huge cloud of uncertainty, known 
as government intervention, had been lifted. 
Which means Covisint can't blame its state of disarray on the policy wonks 
anymore. Instead, the company will have to execute on its B2B promise -- soon 
-- for positive momentum to continue in the B2B sector. 
The influence of the mega exchange, in which Ford (F:NYSE), General Motors 
(GM:NYSE) and DaimlerChrysler (DCX:NYSE) plan to buy materials and supplies 
on the Internet, has already affected the performance of business-to-business 
stocks. Just look at Commerce One (CMRC:Nasdaq) on Monday, when Covisint's 
FTC clearance was made public. It shot up $3.75, or 5.3%, to close at $75.13, 
though it had traded as high as $78.13. But Tuesday, after the initial impact 
of Covisint's clearance had waned, so did Commerce One's stock price. It 
closed down $6, or 8%, at $69.12. 
Similarly, when the antitrust issues started creeping onto the B2B scene, and 
the government made known that it was looking at the exchange over antitrust 
concerns, B2B stocks swooned. Now, going forward, how Covisint executes on 
making B2B a reality, and not just the substance of a press release, will 
surely play itself out on B2B stocks. 
Right now, though, the company's prospect for swift and flawless execution of 
its vision doesn't look good. It hasn't named a CEO. It hasn't finalized yet 
where its headquarters will be. And perhaps most important, it has yet to 
hammer out exactly what technology it will run on. 
""Covisint doesn't have a crutch or an excuse anymore,"" says Scott Crompton, 
vice president for global automotive practices at consultant SeraNova. 
""Before, they could lean on the FTC as to why they weren't going forward, but 
now, they're going to have to show some meaningful progress."" 
To date, there has been anything but. In its first few months, the company 
stumbled about nameless, until Covisint was decided upon. That moniker, which 
is meant to evoke the ideals of communication, vision and integration, 
instead elicited visions of corporate wonks sitting around a triangular table 
white-boarding their separate goals. 
All the while, the company had four interim co-CEOs and two competing 
technologies to run on. Because Oracle (ORCL:Nasdaq) had worked with Ford and 
Commerce One with GM before Covisint was announced, the two software firms 
were both brought into the deal. But ever since then, speculation has run 
rampant over whether one firm would push the other out of the picture. 
On Monday, Commerce One's CEO told TheStreet.com that the technology question 
still hadn't been settled, even if the FTC's antitrust ones had. 
Combine all those things and what you've got is the picture of a joint 
venture between three highly competitive companies that's going nowhere fast. 
Or, as Crompton puts it, Covisint is ""three different companies, two 
different technologies and everyone talking about whether there's a lot of 
arguing and infighting."" 
But Covisint's already come up with someone else to blame. Now that the FTC 
has passed, the company says that it's waiting for approval from the 
Bundeskartellamt, or the German equivalent to the FTC. Covisint insists it 
can't even begin operations in the U.S. until it gets the go-ahead from that 
agency. 
""If you were a supplier and I was a manufacturer, both located in San 
Francisco, we could not do business because the Bundeskartellamt still holds 
this control over Covisint,"" says Thomas Hill, a Covisint spokesman. 
""Everyone at Covisint is anxious to start this business. Once the 
Bundeskartellamt gives its blessing, we expect to see Covisint up and running 
in 30 days."" 
Hill concedes that might sound like another excuse for justifying its lack of 
actual operations. 
""Sure, that might seem like another convenient excuse to delay a launch,"" 
Hill said. ""I would say if people could work 25 hours a day to get this done, 
they would. ... Everyone at Covisint is focused on launching in a really 
timely fashion."" 
The company hasn't settled on a headquarters, in part, because it expects its 
yet-to-be-named CEO to have some input into that decision. And as far as that 
CEO goes, Covisint is still looking for one. Again, Hill said it was hard to 
fill the spot when the FTC was probing the endeavor because of the 
uncertainty that it brought with it. 
""If you're a CEO, why would you leave your current job and take the Covisint 
job before the FTC approved it?"" Hill offered. ""And on the other hand, if 
you're the FTC and you see the company you're reviewing hiring people, that 
might make you look a little more closely at what they're doing."" 
Both good points. But the fact remains that Covisint still has a lot more 
work to do to get up and running, and these kinds of challenges tend to take 
more time than expected, not less. And if those challenges become problems 
for the company, the company could become a problem for the entire B2B 
sector, as investors realize all over again how hard it will be to make B2B 
work. 
So the FTC's approval, while good for the ideal of B2B in general, might have 
come a bit early for Covisint and the public B2B companies now trying to show 
real results going forward. 
""My perspective is that this approval from the FTC is very important for the 
industry as a whole, but it shouldn't be a suggestion that Covisint has 
anything wonderful in the works,"" says Ben Smith, a consultant with A.T. 
Kearney. (His firm is a subsidiary of EDS, which formerly was a part of 
General Motors.) ""Now we can move on to execution. But this doesn't suggest 
that Covisint has moved to that stage."" 
Which means investors in B2B should watch the performance of this exchange 
closely. "
"Agree with your suggestion on how to ""re-package"" the solution.  They should 
write and call legislators and the governor and all sign a document endorsing 
it.

Best,
Jeff

purchase option

I am working on a deal to move TurboPark equipment into Enron owned LLC's, 
with a simultaneous sale of  80% of the equity to a third party.  This deal 
is supposed to close by Jan 15, so I'm getting a crash course on TurboPark 
and how to get stuff out of it during the early phase.  I thought I would 
share what I'm learning, if nothing else as a form of therapy.

Attached to the email is what I believe to be the proper form of notice to 
take something out of TurboPark.  Five to fifteen business days' notice is 
required.

There will be other documents involved as well:

Bill of Sale
Assignment and Assumption Agreement
UCC releases, if applicable (UCC filings are made on all delivered equipment)

I suspect a consent by the equipment seller may also be required.  More to 
come on this one.

As I learn more about the process I will keep you advised.

Subject: CA Development I and II notice of exercise of purchase option

I am attaching a revised draft notice of intent to exercise the purchase 
option for the equipment for the CA transactions. We need two separate 
notices - one for CA I and one for CA II.  Ben/Fred/Rebecca, could you please 
prepare a draft of the two exhibits?
 
Lisa/Catherine/Rose, I revised the form of notice to make it track the 
participation agreement and the development and construction management 
agreement.  

I've tentatively dated the notice as of this Friday.  By my calculations, 
Monday is our drop dead date since a waiver of the 5 day period is not an 
option, and the deal dies if not closed by the 15th.  

Ben mentioned that I should be drafting a ""release letter"" for the banks 
and/or DevCo. It would be a big help if someone could point me to the section 
in the documents which set forth the requirements of the release, since I'm 
still wading through it all and haven't found the relevant language yet.  
Also, please advise of the results of the conference call which you had with 
the lenders (?) and/or their lawyers regarding the issue.

I am working on the assignment and assumption agreement.


Thanks,

Kay

This techniques is useful for all kinds of curves, especially when we

Well, in my usual slacker fashion, I haven't bought my plane ticket yet - so 
I totally think you should go to Sunriver. I might come visit you there if 
there's room. But an S.F. visit is imminent, I swear. I'll call you soon to 
discuss the alcoholism of your co-worker/boyfriend, as well as the techniques 
for acquiring this sexy body for the new year. Work is consuming my life and 
eating me whole - very chaotic what with hiding all the power from you guys 
and whatnot. Imagine the pressure. Another reason it might not be the best 
time for me to come is that I'm moving on Friday. Amber and Molly and I found 
a big, beautiful house in NE, near Grant High - it's kickass. But it's sucked 
away all of my money and will probably take over every free moment for the 
next month just to get it set up. If you want, you should stop by for a sleep 
over on your way to Bend. We'll throw a party. And what's up with the wrist 
disease? Are you not taking your calcium or something? I'm convinced that 
these wacky desk jobs are aging us youthful beauties prematurely. At least 
that's the excuse I like to give when I come in to work looking like I just 
bathed in a life-sized ashtray. Call me soon - I'm really curious to find out 
why Brooks is doing the chicken dance EVER let alone in your room in the 
middle of the night. Wheeew!

Hey Kate -
My subject line is a duplicate of an email I received this morning from some
beauty .com site.  Steve Cross puts me on all of these stupid mailing lists,
so I thought I'd be retarded and put that in my subject line because it's a
stupid subject!

Anyway, how are you doing these days?  I wanted to write and see if you
really got your ticket to come visit over President's Day weekend!  I
totally want you to come down!!!  I'd be so excited.  If you don't, though,
I think I'm going to look into going up to Bend for the weekend to chill in
SunRiver and snowboard a little!  Maybe you could meet me there and stay w/
me at my parents house?  Ash is going up for sure.  If you're coming down
here, that's GREAT!  I'd be SOOO excited.

I'm on complete crack today, if you can't tell.  I have carpal tunnell, too.
Last night I woke up at 2am to Brooks coming home from a drunken night out
and he started doing the chicken dance in my room and almost knocked over my
entire shelf, tv, etc.  Then he started babbling about nothing, passed
straight out and started totally snoring.  So I didn't get back to sleep
until like 4:30 and had to wake up at 6.  I was livid this morning.  I'm
such a bitch, but I need my sleep!  Dammit.

Anyway, write soon!   I miss you!

"I am surprised that the tax people would be ok with the suggested EOL fix.  My understanding was that if the assignment to ENA from ECTRIC happens automatically, that is equivalent -- for tax purposes -- to the UK trader binding ENA and results in bad tax consequences.

Mark, oh master of EOL - Please see the attached documents forwarded to us from London.  My assumption is that the trades by the hedge funds on EOL will have to be with ECTRIC because of the way EOL is set up.  Is this assumption correct or is there any way to trade UK gas, UK electricity, Brent and metals on EOL directly through ENA?  Thanks, as always, for your input.  Frank

Lara,

a summary of what we just discussed 

Hedge Funds wishing to trade with Enron both OTC and online for products not offered by ENA.

1. OTC transactions will be arranged by originators in the New York office and booked in the name of ENA, and then a transaction will be entered into between ENA and the relevant Enron affiliate (eg ECTRIC) to transfer the economic position to the relevant Enron affiliate.

2. Online transactions - see Justin's mail below. The suggestion would be that the Hedge Fund does the trade on EOL with the relevant Enron affiliate (eg ECTRIC). The trade then gets novated from Enron affiliate to ENA. A transaction is then entered into between ENA and Enron affiliate to transfer the economic position. We'll need to work at documentation and process to make this as smooth as possible.

Subject:	RE: Trades as ENA

Justin,

Your solution appears to respond specifically to EOL related legal/credit issues.  However, isn't this only the tip of the iceberg?  What about non-EOL OTC trades conducted by ECTRIC traders with counterparties that want ENA as their counterparty.  From my time in London, it was always impressed upon me that there was a quagmire of additional tax and potential regulatory (SFA) issues.

Please comment.

Also, as a commercially efficient course of action, It has always seemed to me that we should attempt to ""train"" our couterparties to accept that ECTRIC is also a Enron Corp guaranteed sub (at least it was in the past, at their request) and somehow initially set up our contracts/ISDA to be inclusive of this vehicle.  Is this possible?  Otherwise, the permutations of various legal/credit/tax/regulatory hurdles for all manner of OTC trades becomes onerous.

Bill--

Russell

My view would be to follow the novation route, i.e. 

1.	C/P trades via EOL with ECTRIC
2.	Each trade is novated from ECTRIC to ENA, and treated as concluded under ENA ISDA Master
3.	ENA enters into back-to-back trade with ECTRIC

This does mean that the C/P must initially accept the European EOL GTCs, though if we set up a mechanism whereby EOL trades are automatically novated to ENA and treated as concluded under the ENA ISDA Master, this effectively cancels out the EOL GTCs.

Everyone -

Our hedge fund group needs clarification on the issue of doing Brent and other European product deals w/ our hedge fund counterparties and booking them back to ENA, the entity with which all the funds have ISDAs. We just did two WTI/Brent crude oil spreads today, one w/ very large volume, and expect to be doing more such deals. 

This is more than just a legal issue; it's going to impact credit and our strategy to get the funds trading on EOL as well.

As we understand it, the main legal issue is that all the funds have an ISDA only w/ ENA and not w/ ECTRIC, so they (and I assume we) want all deals and legal exposure to be w/ ENA. To satisfy both parties' desires, all European product deals must be booked from ECTRIC to ENA. Sara, from speaking to you and from Justin's response below, it seems to me that the only legal hurdle we, the funds, and our traders might face is if no trader w/ ENA in Houston okays w/ the counterparty on ENA's behalf. However, there seem to be 2 other solutions (a netting agreement and novating) that get around this. As Sara knows, dealing on legal agreements w/ the funds can be onerous and time-consuming; negotiating more paperwork is not a viable option.

From the credit side, as we understand it, the issue w/ not back-to-backing the trades w/ ENA is that the credit exposure will not be aggregated to the funds' net position in Houston and, therefore, not monitored. In other words, any exposure not sitting w/ ENA will be invisible to credit. so daily margining, etc. will  be incorrect. 

From the EnronOnline side, as we see it there are a couple of issues. EOL wants the funds to trade online; an increasing number of funds also want to trade online. However, they do not want to be restricted to trading products that are only US based. Also, they would like to see more arb spread products like a WTI/Brent crude oil spread online. If neither desire can be easily met b/c we need a separate ISDA w/ ECTRIC (which potentially means, as above, more onerous and time-consuming negotiation), then it will certainly be detrimental for volume and also foresake a certain momentum that we are gaining now. 

The point has been raised that the funds could trade European products if credit in London cleared them and if they were willing then to accept the general terms and conditions that pop up on EOL. We can assure you that they will not accept this.

These are the issues as we see them from the origination side. There may be other issues that we're missing from the sides that I've mentioned as well as the trading/back office side. 
Regards,
Russ

Subject:	RE: Trades as ENA

I assume that these are financial transactions. The current approach is the right one in the circumstances - i.e trade between ECTRIC and ENA, trade between ENA and third party (eg Bank of America). It is important that the trader agreeing to the deal with the third party in the name of ENA is located in Houston (they cannot agree deals in the name of ENA when located in London).  The pricing should be such that ENA is compensated for taking the credit risk with respect to the third party but otherwise all the economics should be with ECTRIC. 

To avoid booking the back to back trades, a possibility would be an agreement on netting to be entered into by ECTRIC, ENA and Bank of America if all parties can get comfortable with the legal position.

Another alternative sometimes put forward is that ECTRIC does the deal with Bank of America, the contract is then novated from ECTRIC to ENA, and ENA enters into a back to back swap on the same financial terms with ECTRIC.

Note that we are currently working on a project to enter into financials through EFET LLC (arranged by EEFT) instead of ECTRIC (effective 1 November).

Janine

Hi

I am currently working in the London Risk group for Global Markets.

At the moment we have a number of counterparties who do not want to transact with ECTRIC but would like to do deals only with ENA (e.g. Bank of America). As a result, if a London trader wants to carry out a trade with Bank of America, he will do an internal trade with a trader in Houston and then book a trade between the Houston trader (who trades under ENA) and Bank Of America. The trades are then confirmed from the Houston office.

We were wondering about a couple of things:

Are there any tax/legal implications we should be aware of as a result of booking the trades as we do
Is there a way to approach these counterparties to get them to trade with ECTRIC (as this currently creates a lot of paperwork and administration)?

Thanks for your help

Attached is a draft copy of our Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical
natural gas transactions.  As I mentioned before, we can enter into
transactions for less that one year out.  However, for those outside of a
year and for longer terms, we need to have a master in place.  Hopefully,
we can get this one in place so that we will be prepared when/if we get
ready to transact.

Let me know if you have any questions.  I will have our legal guys standing

CES currently has issues with the BTU conversions at the different Michcon

has a different BTU factor.  This causes CES to be long or short depending on 
the conversion factor.  I'm not sure if there is anything we can do about it

Jeff - I know we are a bit tardy in getting back to you. I think a good place to start would be a close review and routine updates on the following:

1. PGT Gas Accord vs. attempt to convert jurisdiction to FERC in bankruptcy proceeding. As discussed, any delay in PG&E's ability to deal with the generators on a long term basis will facilitate bypass projects into the state.

2. Socal - resurrection of GIR or any plans to open the backbone to firm, path based transportation.

3. Southern Trails battle with Socal to gain access to firm takeaway capacity on SoCal's system and developments in Socal's RLS tariff.

4. Any issues that you believe affect our commercial efforts in California.

Obviously this is a small list. I would appreciate your feedback on issues that you believe to be critical drivers.

Stephanie and I met with Jeff Dasovich in San Fransisco on Friday.  Jeff understands that he can play an important/strategic role in assisting ENA West Gas in understanding the regulated issues for Gas... There is no doubt that ENA has spent most of our resources in power ( and for good reason) however we need to re focus energy on gas related structures. 

To facilitate this effort, Jeff has offered to focus some more of his time and effort on coordinating some of the key commercial issues related to California.  Jane and Stephanie need to create a priority list that represents West Gas issues and ""Hot Button"" or action items. Once created we can work with Jeff on action items.  In addition to this immediate need, Jeff will join our conference call's/meetings ( or attend where possible).  The next session I have on my calendar is Thurs Sept 5 @ 2:30.  

I trust this initiative will further enhance an already effective procedure. If there are any questions, let me know.

Office of the Chairman:

While traveling within Germany recently, I noticed that electric powered 
trains are popular and also provide a safe, reliable, affordable and 
comfortable means of transportation to the public.

This brought to mind a question to ask you:

Is Enron taking any action to promote development and implementation of 
electric trains or light rail in the USA and/or abroad, either through the 
Political Action Committee, Lobbying or through the efforts of the Business 
Development Offices?

I do believe that the commuters would benefit from having access to electric 
trains that provide safe, clean and comfortable transport. Enron could 
potentially benefit by supplying the power for these trains within the USA 
(and abroad as well). 

Just think if the city of Houston offered light rail as an option for 
commuting to and from work, as well as commuting to other locations - both 
interstate and intrastate. A person could take a train to Galveston, Austin, 
or elsewhere and arrive in short time with the high speed rail available. 
With the new Ballpark downtown and the revitalization of the downtown area, 
it would seem that a legitimate method of public transportation is the 
element that is missing from the Houston city model. Buses that run on diesel 
are clearly not the solution for mass transit.

"Attached is a first draft of the swap for the Raptor 2 structure.  Please 
consider the following questions and I will amend the confirmation 
accordingly:

1.  I have bracketed the concept of multiple notices for purposes of multiple 
partial terminations and therefore multiple Valuation Dates.  Before we 
eliminate this concept, I just want to make certain that everyone is in 
agreement as to how this swap will terminate.  [Do we want partial 
terminations based upon partial asset sales?]

2.  Assuming that termination occurs upon sale of 100% of the assets, I need 
to be sure that the word ""sale"" is sufficient.  Should we use ""financial 
close"" or some other term of art?  I have concerns that a sale may be 
contingent or subject to some waiting period.

Michael has strep (as do I), so he and I are home today.  He is on two 
antibiotics which he takes twice a day.  I'm trying to figure out how to get 
these to you, since these have to be refrigerated.  Obviously, if Michael  
isn't doing great I won't go.  Currently, he feels fine, and only feels bad 
when he has fever. He woke up with fever again this am, but the fever should 
go away after 24 hours on the antibiotics.  Just let me know if you aren't 
comfortable with  the situation.  I can always leave on Saturday, or not at 
all.

Michael's doctor is Rey Calderon 713 520 9550.  His wife (and assistant) is 
Delores, and they are wonderful about returning calls, etc.

We will be staying at the Hyatt Hill Country Resort, 210 647 1234. Saturday

Georgetown), but Neil will still be at the Hyatt.

Subject: Order Instituting Rulemaking to Establish Policies and Cost
Recovery Mechanisms for Generation Procurement


On October 29, 2001, the commission issues an order instituting a rulemaking
to establish ratemaking mechanisms to enable SCE, PG&E and SDG&E to resume
purchasing electric energy, capacity ,ancillary services and related hedging
instrument to full their obligation to serve their customers once DWR's
authority to purchase on their behalf ends (December 31, 2001). At that
point, the UDCs, not DWR, will have to pick up anything not covered by
retained generation and the DWR contracts.  The Commission will also address
proposals on how renewable resources should be included in the mix of
generation serving the state. The OIR will have a significant impact on
procurement practices in the state on a going forward basis.    The ruling
states that if you are interested in being on the service list for this
proceeding, a letter must be sent to the docket office stating that fact
within 15 days (by next Monday). 

Bottom line is do you want me to continue to monitor (and perhaps get
active) in this proceeding.  Please let me know by the end of the week so
that I can send in the required letter.

"All of the assignment documents are supposed to be filed in the contract 
file.  Please review the contract file for these assignment effective dates.  
The date something is invoiced has nothing to do with the tariff filings, 
what is important is the delivery period and terms.  imbalance cashouts 
should be reported as such under the transport tariff, not a sales tariff, 
unless the transport does not provide for cash-out in which case a separate 
sales tariff needs to be set up to go with the Sales Contract which should be

		 Subject: Missing Tariff Numbers on HPL Annual Report



Dan:  The following sales contracts were listed on the HPL Annual Report 
without a tariff number.  

Would you review the following information and advise as to whether a sales 
tariff filing is required.  It appears that the transactions related to these 
sales contracts took place prior to the time the contracts were assigned to 
Houston Pipe Line Company.  Let me know if the tariffs we prepared to respond 
to the Auditors query, should truly be included with our November 10th TRRC 
Tariff Filing Report..

Contract #96022611:  H&D Operating Company - Gas Lift Sales:  Delivery period 
01/99 Invoiced 9/10/99; Delivery period 02/99 Invoiced 10/12/99.   HPL needs 
sales tariff for period after assignment.

Contract #96019866:  OXY USA. Inc. - Imbalance Cashout Contract: Delivery 
period 03/99; Demand Charge Invoiced 3/26/99.  Why shouldn't this be under 
the transport tariff for this transport imbalance.

Contract #96022610: Preferred Pipeline Company - GTC Sale Spot: Delivery 
period 01/99 and 02/99; Invoiced 08/27/99. Who issued the GTC, if HPL, then 
HPL needs to file a sales tariff.

Contract #96019865: Texcol Gas Services Inc. - Imbalance Cashout Contract 
(Contract was set up per Tommy Yanowski relating to the imbalance on 
Terminated Transport Agreement 12-88974-204  (311a2(284C)Offshore Tx); 
Delivery period 02/99; Invoiced 03/25/99. Cashout under 311transport should 
not require a tariff filing, however, it may require a FERC filing.

Contract #9600821: HPL Resources Company - Master Purchase Sale Firm.
Delivery period 01/99, Invoiced 02/12/99
Delivery period 02/99, Invoiced 03/24/99
Delivery period 04/99, Invoiced 06/10/99; 09/10/99
Accounting Summary Report of Manual Invoices recorded in the G/L for 01/99, 
03/99, 04/99, 05/99, 06/99, 07/99, 09/99, 10/99, 11/99 and  12/99.
Do you know when this contract came back to HPL and should the tariff reflect 
activity that took place prior to when it was assigned to HPL?  This 
information should be in the contract file.  The tariff should not  reflect 
activity prior to the time the contract was assigned to HPL.
 
I will need to get final information to Carla Nguyen by Monday October 30 so 
she can make the appropriate notations to the annual report pages 31a2, 31a3 
and 31a4.

Thanks for all your help!

Jeff, thanks again for attending the discussions with DWR.

Do you have any recon.... on exactly which plants DWR has the right to bring the fuel on. As Mark indicated, it was about 1/3 of their exposure, and most of that was in the south service area, but I am very interested in the actual facilities and whom used to bring fuel to them or run the units.'

There is a zero sum game on fuel... but the landscape changes depending on who buys it and how they buy it! 

Any thoughts.

"Holli:

We need to talk about status.
I spoke yesterday with three EWEB lawyers and Dick Varner.
I have to comment back on the Schedule to the master agreement.  EWEB has not 
yet reviewed the Credit Support Annex and needs to submit their proposed 
legal opinion.  EWEB is reserving discussion of the confirmations pending 
resolution of the master agreement.

Most important, however, is the EWEB legal opinion which will be limited by 
the capacity of EWEB's traders to enter into financial trades at any given 
point in time.  EWEB is insisting that we assume the obligation of knowing 
whether an EWEB trader is authorized to act and how that EWEB trader is 
authorized to act under EWEB's trading policy because, under Oregon law (and 
the law of all states), financial trades executed by unauthorized persons 
(employed by governmental entities) are completely void.  

Your two trades (which began as physical deals and were transformed into 
financial deals) were authorized by EWEB's recent board resolution.  However, 
you cannot rely fully on this resolution for future trades.  Before you ever 
trade with EWEB again, you will not be able to rely upon your past 
relationship with an EWEB trader.  You will first have to conduct some due 
diligence with respect to the EWEB trader and the EWEB trading policy.

ENA has never agreed to this type of arrangement.

Let's schedule a time to discuss the agreement further.  Thanks.  Sara "

Carlos -

The documents attached to the ConEd message here are their draft Electric & 
Gas Cost Reimbursement Agreements.  They cover the costs of grid 
interconnection for any site we might develop in ConEd's territory.  
Apparently, Gary Keevil of East Coast Power has been handling discussions 
with ConEd to this point, but with East Coast Power out of the picture, I'm 
picking it up.

Kathleen has coached me on questions about these documents.  First, do we 
have a Confidentiality Agreement with ConEd that covers these power 
development project discussions?  She's going to ask Stephen Plauche of 
Origination about this, but I'm betting we don't have one.

Second, are these agreements ""Turbo Park"" compliant, and have we set up an 
LLC to deal with New York development projects yet?  I understand Herman 
Manus is the expert on this topic.

Finally, what are the legal sticking points in these documents?  ConEd has 
called an informational meeting for next Tuesday, May 1st, for these 
documents.  I'm planning to attend.  I'd like to know by then what we like 
and don't like about them, and how to approach possible changes.

I'll call you later this morning so we can discuss how to proceed.

"Joel --

I've taken a quick look at these and think that they are really more in the physical trading line than derivatives.  I'm trying to figure out who the physical metals trading lawyer is to take a look at them for you.

I am forwarding initial documents concerning an inventory finance transaction. 

Mark, I am distributing to your attention since the structure involves the buying/selling of inventory in a trading arrangement, and the documents are in some respects derived from an ISDA format. While this is a ""financing"" with a bank, and hence my involvement, there are trading aspects here as well. [Mike Robison is reviewing from the EWS business unit perspective.]If someone in your group should review, please advise.

Justin, I am distributing to your attention, since the choice of law is English, and you were involved in the prior Metals transaction that this is derived from. If someone else in London should review, please advise.

Please find attached first drafts of:

1 the Master Agreement;
2 the Forward Sale Agreement; and
3 the Agency Agreement.

 <<00300601_EnronCorp_DES.doc>>  <<010702_Forward_Sale_Agreemnt_DES.doc>>  
<<010702_DES_EnronAgencyAgreement.doc>> 


For ease of review, I also attach:

1 the Master Agreement marked up to show changes against the physical metal
Master Agreement (as last amended on 21 May 2001);

 <<00300601_EnronCorp_DES.doc>> 

2 the Forward Sale Agreement marked up to show changes against the physical
metal Master Agreement (as last amended on 21 May 2001); and

 <<REVISED3.DOC>> 

3 the Agency Agreement marked up to show changes against the physical metal
Master Agreement (as last amended on 21 May 2001);

 <<PhysMstrvAgency.doc>> 


Please note the following:

1. General

- I have drafted the agency and forward sale aspects previously contained in
the physical metal Master Agreement in separate agreements. In order to
ensure that these agreements are as distinct as possible, certain elements
of the physical metal Master Agreement (for example, conditionality of
Transactions/Call Options on hedging) may have to be included in a separate
side letter. 
- To the extent that I have insufficient details in relation to this
transaction, I have retained the structure of the physical metal Master
Agreement.
- These drafts have not been reviewed by Enron and therefore remain subject
to their comments.

2. Master Agreement

- As the Commodities will not be exchange traded, I have introduced the
concepts of ""Reference Price"" and ""Pricing Date"", which are similar to those
contained in the 1993 ISDA Commodity Derivatives Definitions.
- Enron would like to be able to enter into Transactions/exercise Call
Options on non-Business Days.
- I have, where possible, avoided referring to the Agency Agreement and the
Forward Sale Agreement. However, one aspect of the Agency Agreement that
does remain in the Master Agreement is that of ""Agency Costs"", which is, in
some instances, an intrinsic element of pricing. This will need to be
discussed.
- I have removed the concept of ""Minimum Value"", which I understand will not
form part of this transaction.
- I understand that, due to the nature of the Commodities, there may be an
imbalance in the quantity sold and that delivered. Although the consequences
of this need to be discussed, I have introduced provisions to cater for this
(see Clauses 4.3 and 5.5.5).

3. Forward Sale Agreement

- I have attempted to make this agreement as distinct as possible from the
Agency and the Master Agreements.
- The pricing of the forwards needs to be discussed.
- I have removed ""Credit Support Default"" as an Event of Default.

4. Agency Agreement

- As with the Master and Forward Sale Agreements, I have attempted to make
this agreement as distinct as possible.


I look forward to discussing your comments and working with you on this
transaction.

Kind regards

for is April 20th and 21st. ?We are invited to both the rehearsal dinner and  
the wedding, which is at the Houstonian. ? 

With Maury's work schedule, I bet that he will be unable to make the dinner,  
so I need to decide if I am going to or not. ?But, we would like to come for  
the wedding. ?That is either asking you to help us with the kids...all of  
them, or ... helping us find enough sitters for them if you have plans. ? 
Steve has offered to keep Carolyn, and if we come just the night, I might do  
that. ??It is just a hard decision to make. ?She is still so young. 

Anyway, please see if this conflicts with anything. ?The other option would  
be to stay at John and Yvonne's....or leave the boys there...and Maury and I  
stay with Carolyn at the Houstonian. ?We do not want to impose....and I know  
that I am asking alot. 

Easter sounds good to us. ?There was a chance that Maury's sister was  
coming...but they just found out they owe alot in Taxes....so cancelled. ?We  
will probably go on down on Thursday night since we are off on Good Friday. ? 
There is a big event in San Antonio that I plan to take the kids to. ?I 
think  
it will be at 1:00...so we will plan to be gone on that day. ?Which will 
give  
some breathing room for whoever is there. ?There is this huge egg hunt at 
the  
Episcopal Diosese...which is where Maury's mom works...and I hear it is  
better than any country club egg hunt. ?Just fun. ?So we will go there and  
come back for the night. 

When it gets closer we can coordinate some meals. ?I would be happy to  
grocery shop for everyone.....and split it down there. ?What do you feel 
like  
having. 

Anyway, I will talk with you later.

Margaret Carson is going to join us in the meeting next week with Nesbitt.  
Vince will check with ENA to see if they also want to attend.  I would also 
like to determine if ETS and/or NBP would want to send a representative(s), 
although Margaret said she would take copious notes for distribution to other 
key players as necessary.  We should ask Nesbitt how he would structure a 
deal for multiple clients (eg. ETS, NBP, ENA, and maybe El Paso).  

[We need to remain aware of any ""affiliate"" issues that may result, and make 
certain that we are in complete compliance with the regs.]

I will wait until after our meeting with Nesbitt before deciding if/how to 
approach El Paso.  Presumably, if asked to particpate, they would share the 
cost and have independent access to any working model that is developed.

John,

I talked to Dale Nesbitt. He suggested that the best way to evaluate his 
model is to
go through a one week intensive project with assistance of somebody from his 
company.
Our cost  is a flat fee of $12,500 that would be deducted from the purchase 
price of $55,000,
in case we buy the software package.

The price of 55K is indicative and will be adjusted based on the required 
level of support.

Dale will be in Houston next week. I have tentatively invited him to visit 
with us on Tuesday,
November 7, at 3:00 p.m. He will adjust if you are busy at this time.


Please, let me know what you think.

Kay and I would like to get together tomorrow (Wednesday) morning to discuss 
the Intergen transaction.  Specifically, we would like to discuss: 1) the 
steps/timeline associated with assigning the equipment from TurboPark to 
Intergen, and 2) the accounting condition(s) required to be satisfied in 
order for the transaction value to be booked as 2000 earnings.

Intergen is holding a Board meeting this afternoon and the Enron/Intergen 
transaction is on the agenda for approval.   We expect to hear the results of 
that Board meeting sometime tomorrow morning.  If Intergen receives Board 
approval to proceed, our current goal is to have the transaction documents in 
a final form for signing on Thursday of this week.  This would allow us to 
notify TurboPark on Thursday or Friday of our intent to assign the equipment 
to Intergen.  It is unclear if this assignment can be accomplished by 12/29.

Kay has a meeting at 10 am.  Can we me at 8:30 or 9:00 a.m.?  Call/email me 
to confirm the time and location of this meeting.

Subject: California Update 07.18.01

The Senate, the Assembly and the Governor are either poised to engage in very 
difficult negotiations, or the three are about to crash and burn and Edison's 
going to be left dangling.

In the Senate:
The Senate bill 78XX is with about 90% likelihood going to be voted out of 
the Senate tonight---without a vote having taking place in any committee.
Burton announced during one of the two ""informational"" hearings that ""this is 
it,"" despite the view of just about everyone who appeared before the 
committees the bill likely won't prevent Edison from going bankrupt.
The key features of the bill are:
Banks and QFs get paid in full.
Edison shareholders would be responsible for debts owed to suppliers
No direct access.
There are conflicting reports about whether the Senate will take up the bill 
tomorrow de-linking the bonds from the DWR contracts and whether the 
Republicans will go along with it.

In the Assembly:
The Committee is hearing the Wright and Hertzberg bills as we speak, with 
Hertzberg's the likely winner.
That bill now provides for Direct Access under certain conditions (the 
amendments describing the conditions were faxed today).
We're attempting to get the ""July 12"" date changed to ""the effective date of 
the bill"" or later.
The Assembly likely won't vote the Hertzberg bill out until tomorrow at the 
earliest.

The Problem:
The Assembly and Senate bills are diametrically opposed in the way each 
approaches the problem---in short, the bills are two ships passing in the 
night.
The Democratic leaders (Governor, Hertzberg, Burton) aren't talking, and 
Burton hasn't expressed any interest in talking---to anybody.

The likely outcome given the circumstances:  
Burton says he's done what he needs to do (i.e., passed out a ""fair"" bill); 
the Assembly and Senate can't agree; they finish the budget; time runs out; 
they leave Friday; and Edison's left twisting.

That said, there's still a chance that the Governor could call Burton and sit 
down with Burton and Hertzberg and work something out by Friday, or begin 
talking and postpone the recess until they get it worked out.  But given 
Burton, the chance of that happening seems very slim.

In short, little has changed since yesterday.

Best,
Jeff

Kay, I called Cingular to see what was up with your bill.  The last payment 
was made the end of March.  Your credit card expired March, 2001.  So, you 
are not set up currently for your credit card to be charged.  I'm going to go 
ahead and expense this charge and then you'll need to pay it.  If you want it 
set up again on your credit card, you have to send Cingular a letter stating 
your wishes.

I also changed your address to this building while I had her on the phone.

Is all of this ok with you?>

Dear Kay and Dale,
 Peter Thompson is on vacation and has asked me to make the
attached changes (sent to Peter by Dale).  They are very
straight-forward and will only take a minute.  However, there are a
couple of contracts to which the changes could potentially apply, and
I'd like to make sure I've got the right one before I start making
changes.  Please let me know which contract needs to be changed, and
I'll take care of the rest.  Thank you, Chris

Chris, Greg is putting the finishing touches on the Power Master as well as a 
GTC.

Greg, Chris needs the Master form ASAP so we can take the lead on this 
Ontario industry form development iniative.  Can you finalize the form and 
prepare a bullet point memo as requested by Chris comparing the differences 
between our form and EEI.

Greg, also you should coordinate a Calgary office meeting with traders and 
originators (not more than 1 hour) to unveil and explain the form ASAP.  
Alberta Market Opening and PPA trading commences Jan 1/01 and we may need 
push to get Masters signed or rely on GTC in the short term.

Chris, you should do likewise in Toronto when appropriate.

Milly, would it be a worthwhile expense for Greg to attend the firstOntario 
industry meeting in Toronto with Chris, as Greg has the background on 
developing the form?

Mark and Elizabeth, FYI.

Peter.

Subject: Power Master

Greg - Sorry to keep bothering you on the Power Master, but I was wondering 
what is the ETA for the form?  The reason I ask is that I am going to be 
involved in the industry push here in Ontario to develop a standard physical 
bilateral agreement.  While it is my understanding that many participants 
want to start with the EEI form and OPGI believes that they already have a 
next to final form, for obvious reasons Peter and Milly would like to see our 
form become the industry standard.

Another thing that would be helpful is a brief memo describing the 
differences between the EEI form and our form and the rationale for the 
differences.  Some of this may be readily apparent from running a blackline, 
but I would like to have the benefit of the knowledge you have built up in 
developing the form.  

Timing of this is fairly tight as the next meeting on this initiative is 
November 9th.  My goal is to show up at the meeting and advocate a 
""Canadianized"" version of the EEI form and then describe the great time and 
effort Enron has expended on this already and table our draft as a starting 
point.

Apparently EEI will also be in attendance.  I will follow up with Elizabeth 
Sager on what is the status of our relationship with EEI and what was the US 
experience in developing the EEI master.

We are running short on time.  We are planning to sign on  Tuesday, and I hesitate to put a new document in front of them at this late date. Would it be easier to work with reps/warranties?

I definitely need an answer from your firm confirming (1) enforceability  (2) obligation of the Cities to financially support agreement.

Also, could you provide me with the Mississippi law defn of consequential damages and a couple of examples where Enron could be responsible for same  under this agreement?  Also, can MDEA and the Cities be liableto Enron for consequentials (absent a waiver)?  

Your comments to the previously forwarded draft would be greatly appreciated.

Jeff:

Following is a summary of recent EPMI West Power activity with the 3 
California utilites

PG&E - EEI Master Agreement in place.  As part of their recent RFP, we 
completed 2, 50 MW,  5 year, sale transactions for peak hours at $58.40 and 
$58.70.  They are looking at EOL although they have not transacted on it.  
They call regularly for shorter dated quotes.  We deal with Claudia Grief who 
works in Joe Henri's group.  Overall, we have a very positive relationship 
and look forward to increasing business.

Edison - Almost finished negotiation of a EEI Master Agreement to allow 
transactions.  We are haggling about some credit issues, but expect these to 
be resolved shortly.  We participated in their only RFP.   They did not 
transact with us or, to our knowledge, with others. They got cold feet.   We 
work with Jill Horswell, Sean Baker and Bennie Wu.  Since master contracts 
are not done yet, and no deals have been completed, I would say this 
relationship is not as good as PG&E but better than SDG&E.  I would expect 
that we will be doing regular cash business by the end of the year.  They are 
looking at EOL.

SDG&E - We have participated in 3 RFPs and have not been successful.  We have 
been trying to sell them longer dated energy (5 years).  We believe they have 
bought from others but for small size and limited duration.  We work with 
Sharon Firooz.  We have sent them master EEI agreements and are not making as 
much progress in getting them to agree.  They prefer using the  WSPP contract 
rather than EEI.  We hate WSPP.  We will keep pounding on them until they see 
the light but it will likely take longer.  Plus they are far more skittish 
re: longer dated transactions thatn the other utilites.  This said, I would 
be surprised if we were not transacting with them on shorter term deals by Q1 
2001.  They are not using EOL.

Please let me know if this summary meets your needs 503/464-3822.

need to get those tickets to you pretty soon.  Let me know what days you
are in town this week.

The 8th works for me. Where is the Duke party this year?

Hey man!  Haven't talked to you in awhile.  Hope things are good.  David
reminded me about the game the other day.  Are you still headed to Spain
for Thanksgiving?  If so, let me know when you want to get together and do
the ticket/money swap.  I'll be in Florida this weekend, but should be home
on weekends after that for awhile.  Or, we can do it one week night if I'm
in town.  Unfortunately, my travel schedule is not slowing down around the
holidays like I'd hoped.

I also have another favor to ask - is there any chance you would go to our
Christmas party with me on Dec 8 if I go?  David will obviously be there,
too.  I'm such a loser that I've had to go by myself the last three years
and that's such a drag.  Let me know if you think you'd consider it.

Vince,

  I've been hearing rumors that Enron has decided to endorse
the nodal pricing model as implemented in PJM.
I just wanted to warn you that I'm not sure
this is in Enron's long-term interest at all.  Let me explain
why.  Feel free to give me a call if you'd like to talk
more about this.

  First, let me say that I firmly believe in locational pricing
and specifically pricing congestion.  However, the way that PJM
implements nodal pricing is to eliminate as much price volatility
and reduce the transparency of the market.  Specifically, the
PJM tariff gives the ISO the ability to mitigate to cost plus a
%10 adder the bids of any market participant that the ISO deems
is out of merit in one of the three zones in region.  (The fact
that a nodal market is talking about zones should give you cause for alarm.)
Then the ISO takes this mitigated bid and re-runs its price-setting
software to compute new nodal prices.  The way I have (somewhat
unfairly) decribed this price-setting process is that the
PJM ISO decides what prices it would like
for a given day and mitigates bids until it gets them.  This is not
a transparent market, nor one where it makes any sense to buy
the risk management services that Enron provides.  The
only price volatility you have to worry about in the PJM market is
that kind that comes about if they need imports into their control area
to meet demand.  Under these circumstances, you need to pay the
imports whatever is necessary to get them to come to your market.

  However, bear in mind FERC's desire to make a large RTO on the
East Coast.  This will effectively mean little imports
to the East Coast RTO, so all bids can be mitigated at
the discretion of the ISO.  Paying market-clearing prices to cost-of-service
mitigated bids is just paying too much to eliminate price volatility.
It effectively kills off the development of risk management at
the wholesale and retail level.  Power marketing becomes much less
profitable because retailers know you can always buy at cost-mitigated
prices.

  In short, the PJM model is not market.  It is just an alternative
form of regulation that is politically attractive because it reduces
price volatility, but it is not good for consumers or traders because they just
get a higher cost form of regulation than traditional cost-of-service
regulation. You pay market-clearing prices to cost-of-service
mitigated bids, but under regulation you could just pay cost-of-service
prices and eliminate the infra-marginal profits to low cost generators.

  As we discussed during our dinner, I think the two biggest sources
of benefits from re-structuring will come from getting the demand-side
involved in the market and from more efficient risk management.  A
necessary condition for both of these to occur is prices that reflect
actual conditions in the market (including the extent of market power
exercised).  Masking these signals dulls any incentive for market
participants to make the investment necessary to management.  The PJM
model is just way to have a market in name without achieving any
significant benefits to consumers or energy traders.

Frank"

FYI.  Note below that even the mighty and powerful Power Authority's own
crackerjack analysis asserts that there is still a net short (despite
DWR contracts and DA ""stampede""), which should leave one to believe
that, contrary to Angelides' letter, the more the DA the better. Which
further supports Loretta Lynch's response to the Angelides' letter that
DA reduces the amount of spot power DWR has to buy.

CONSUMER POWER AND CONSERVATION FINANCING AUTHORITY 
Pace of Power Authority Renewable Portfolio Agenda is Slowed 
Quite possibly the most significant action taken at the October 19
Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority (Power Authority)
was its inaction on contracts proposed for approval. The Power Authority
has aggressively pursued a broad renewable portfolio, with the intent to
approve contracts as soon as possible. 
Instead of approving a number of contracts on its October 19 agenda, the
Power Authority deferred calendared decisions on request for bids until
its November 2 meeting, acknowledging that no action can be taken until
the Department of Water Resources (DWR) rate agreement stalemate has
been resolved. 
Chairman Freeman stated that the Public Utility Commission's rejection
of the rate agreement has created an obstacle for the Power Authority to
exercise renewable contracts, to contract for peaker generation and/or
to implement demand side programs. The Power Authority relies upon DWR's
credit to fund these programs, and until a rate agreement is finalized
the Power Authority cannot sign contracts. 
Freeman indicated that the Power Authority has signed letters of intent
to purchase output from 14 biomass facilities in the Central Valley, as
well as 400 MW generated by wind. 
With the Current Glut of Contracts, Why Do We Need Additional Reserves? 
Kellan Flukinger, Senior Advisor to Chairman Freeman and Laura Doll,
provided a detailed presentation explaining why he believes the Power
Authority must contract for additional renewable and peaking generation.
Flukinger believes that despite direct access and the current glut of
electricity supplied in long-term contracts, there still appears to be a
net short of a few thousand megawatts within the State. 
Flukinger concluded that the State still is at the mercy of electric
generators who are not subject to PUC regulatory authority and who have
no real obligation to build and maintain new facilities or to serve
customers within the State. He believes that the short-term contracts
and spot purchases leave the state vulnerable to price-spikes and supply
shortages. He believes that the reserve can be managed through
Time-of-Use and Real-Time-Pricing, conservation, interruptibles, demand
side management, renewables and peakers. 
Power Authority Names William Barry as Chief Financial Officer 
William Barry was approved as Chief Financial Officer of the Power
Authority at its October 19 Board meeting in Sacramento. Mr. Barry
currently works for the City of San Francisco, and has worked in the
past for the New York Power Authority.

		 Subject: OGC/AGC Approval Policy for More Than One Year Contracts

Mark:

Got your voice mail on this. I wasn't sure if you were suggesting the policy 
for trading contracts or all contracts of greater than a year.

My thoughts are as follows:

1) Policy Scope: I think we need to address whether the Policy will extend to 
trading as well as origination transactions. As you know, often there is a 
very blurry line.

2) Existing Masters: If a master is in place, confirmations will be used for 
terms of one month to greater than one year. I don't think it will be 
practical for us to approve these confirmations before signature unless there 
are material modifications done to the pre-approved confirmation template in 
the master, which would require Legal approval in the present state of 
affairs.  I assume the Policy would only apply to individually negotiated 
contracts outside a Master Agreement.

3) Order of Magnitude: We should consider having a dollar figure (determined 
simply by multiplying the notional or contract volume x the contract price or 
the Enron financial commitment amount), coupled with the one year or greater 
term, that would require the additional OGC/AGC approval in order to make 
sure the requirement is imposed only for higher dollar contracts.

I would be happy to discuss this with you further.

"Richard:

The corporate workbook reflects that the officers of Enron Credit, Inc. all 
reside in the U.K.  I don't see anyone identified with a power of attorney 
for executing documents in Houston.  

As there may be tax issues associated with U.K. officers signing (in the U.K) 
on behalf of a U.S. company, I am asking  for verification from Janine.

My suggestion is that Enron Credit Ltd. negotiate and execute the agreement 
and include the usual ""affiliates, representatives, etc."" who may need to 
know any confidential information.  Your V.P.'s are all in London.  

If Janelle confirms that it's alright for Brown, Sherriff or Seyfried to sign 
for Enron Credit, Inc. from London, then we can prepare the document and have 
a V.P. sign and fax the agreement to the U.S. party.  At a minimum, though, 
we should try to work from our form of NDA.

Let me know if you have any questions.

The contract Mark gave me to review yesterday only covers monthly salary.  I 
had expected there to be some discussion/reference to long-term comp plan.  
Mark had mentioned that what he gave me did not deal with certain non-compete 
payments owed to me in 2000, so I am not looking for that, but I did think he 
had said that there was something in the doucment re:long-term, which I 
cannot find.  Please advise if I am missing something.  I will withhold other 
comments for now, except to note that the draft was dated 13 March, and had a 
14 day period before expiry (now passed), and will assume that that is an 
irrelevancy.  Look forward to hearing from one of you. mcs

Hi,

	How are you?  Just a brief note to let you know that I followed up on the letter (dated May 2nd) to Dr. Ken Lay from the President of Howard University.

	I spoke with President Swygert and Dr. Hassan Minor about how Enron may assist Howard University in structuring a new Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering Center (ISE).

	I was informed that Howard will be forwarding further details onto Dr. Lay and me as to how Enron can help them move forward with the development of the ISE.

	Will keep you posted.

Kind regards,

OK, here's the working draft ""masterpiece"" (haha).   Please review and provide comments and feedback by the end of the week (note: Ted and David, we have a conference call scheduled Wednesday for the three of us to discuss).   Also, I'm sending to Price Waterhouse Coopers for their input as well - I need to spend more time reviewing what they sent on Friday to see if I've missed any issues we want to address.

I have not reviewed the details or the (one-RAC) structure with any of the other RAC or risk management functions - please do not distribute yourselves as I'd like to ""cushion"" the reception. 

Review meetings with these functions begins tomorrow (Tuesday), when I meet with:
?	Dave Gorte,
?	Bill Bradford and Molly Harris
?	Sally Beck's group (Beth Apollo and James New)
?	Treasury (Perkins and later, Despain)
?	Internal Audit (Kilchrist)
?	Legal (Sayre/Taylor)

I'll wait to hear from David/Ted tomorrow morning as to whether I should provide a complete draft to any of these other functions or to Rick Buy at this point, or if I should wait until later in the week when we've all had the opportunity to review.  

As I turn around the next draft, I'll work on a power point presentation for use in the executive meetings beginning the last week of June (Business Unit Offices of the Chairman, Whalley, Causey, Fastow, Skilling).  I made a quick summary of changes in the document attached below; going forward I will refine this and perhaps red-line the current policy to assist our detailed review.  


Thanks for your help,

Enermetrix will be matching us up with the Buyers.  We would have the right 
to perform a credit check and turn around in 48 hours however we should know 
the counterparty before we submit a bid.  This would be for both gas and 
power.  Additionally, the agreement that I sent to you was already negotiated 
by EES and has concessions in it that can speed up the process.

"Andrea:  Would you please see that I am added to circulation of  the deal 
transaction list (containing trading deals)?  Thanks.  Sara "
"Ted,

We have the first running version of VaR model for the MG positions. Many 
thanks to Tanya and Anjam for taking lead
in this effort. We had also great help from Cantekin and Kirstee. We want to 
validate some  inputs
before releasing the number. Specifically, I want to make sure that both 
London and Houston work
with the same position numbers every day to avoid confusion.

A few comments.

1. We plan to set up the models to run VaR concurrently in Houston 
(Cantekin)  and London (Kirstee) with the same inputs.
The reason to do it this way is that we may have to respond quickly to 
multiple inquiries in both locations. (Cantekin and Kirstee,
please stay in touch and synchronize the inputs ).

2. It is critical that we run the model daily and receive the updated 
positions and prices on a regular basis.

3. We shall continue work in Houston to improve the model. Two critical areas:

 a. VaR model, by its nature, does not capture one big risk MG has in its 
portfolios. This is the liquidity risk
       resulting from different cash consequences of the hedges and the 
underlying positions.
 b.  We should go through due diligence to validate the process generating 
the position numbers (i.e. look
                      into the details of specific transactions).  From what 
I know, MG has a fairly rudimentary risk
       management system and I am not quite sure how they generate option 
prices (and deltas). They get some
                      option prices by calling brokers.

4. I think the current VaR is within 80-85% of the true number (assuming the 
inputs are right). But, as I have said,
     VaR does not capture all the risks that we have to worry about.

Should I contact Tim Hamilton, or have you already done this?  Also--if you could help me find where in the websites the information is, that would be helpful.  Is it just the OFO tariffs that are on the websites or is there actual data on how often they have called OFOs, when they were called, etc. also published?  We need all of that to better evaluate our risks/costs of serving those customers.  Thanks for your help.

Greetings Colleen:
I'm not sure who's still working on this and who's not, but sometime back, we did a very extensive effort with Tim Hamilton and the rest of the EES team to get all information compiled regarding OFOs behind PG&E and SoCalGas.  I'm hoping that that information still exists so we can hopefully avoid recreating the wheel.  If, for some reason, the information is lost, the good news is that all OFO tariffs are compiled and easily retrievable on the SoCalGas' and PG&E's websites.  Please let me know how else we can help.

Best,
Jeff

Leslie -- Funny you should ask.  Columbia of Ohio called 51 OFO/OMO days last winter.  Other Columbia companies ( C of Penn., C of VA) did likewise.  Attached is a confidential draft complaint from our attorney in Ohio that I believe provides the info you seek.  Also attached is the Complaint filed by Hess,et al in Pennsylvania against Columbia there.  The facts and allegations are essentially the same:  confiscation/interruption of banked gas during OFO; OFO called for economic, not operational  reasons; heavy penalties for failure to deliver full MDQ; etc. 
My recollection is that Peoples and NorthShore called few, if any OFOs last winter.  Ditto for Nicor. I have a call in to those that know first hand about these latter three utilities so I'll forward that answer as soon as I receive it.
Please call if you have any questions or if can be of further assistance.

Last week I asked you about OFOs and you requested a list of the LDCs we are most interested in.  At this time (and in this order), I need any information you can give us on OFO history (frequency, actual dates, reason for OFO--system long or short?, etc.) on the following LDCs:

	PG&E, Socal	
	NIGAS, Peoples (Chicago), Northshore
	Columbia of Ohio

This is a good starting point for now.  Just so you know, we need this data as we are trying to verify/set/modify (whatever you want to call it), the price curves being set by the traders reflecting LDC risk.  Obviously, the frequency of OFOs will affect our risk of doing business on a particular LDC, so we need to try to compare and access charges associated with each.  Any help or direction you can provide on where to get this data would be most appreciated.

"Here are issues which I'm unclear about, all of which impact the drafting of the agreement:


How are we setting the heat rate?  Do we have the GADS (?)?  Is it a daily average, weekly average?  Flat rate? Adjusted? If so, how often?

Are we comfortable that there are no permit restrictions?

We have determined that we won't deal with fuel oil, right?

We aren't making money on gas, right?

Do we have a defn of costs that we like yet, and if so, how does it fit in to the picture?

Is there an up-to-date set of exhibits?  

It would help if theh commercial part of the team could send me the following, in words and/or formulae:

The defn and method of establishing the bogey (target production cost) formula can be an exhibit, which would be great for the commercial team to work on.   Are we determined how we should deal with imbalances (part of cost of power)?  How are we setting the bogey?  Formula?  Subject to audit? Two bogeys or one (gas and oil)?

What is defn of profit?  I think I have the general idea, but a sentence or two would be helpful as a reality check.  What costs are included on the buy and sell side?

Re stack model: a sentence or two describing what it is and how it is used.

Updated exhibit on facilities, contracted resources, operating limits.

What information does MDEA need for us to provide in order to split costs/profits?  Are we clear that Cities buy gas, MDEA buys/sells power?

It would be great if I could get one set of answers to these questions/issues, which has commercial buy in all around.

Subject: Workload Responsibiities in Argentina

Andrea and Fabian;

Over the past few days, Randy Young, Mike Guerriero and I discussed the 
proper manner to have the both of you working as an integrated legal team in 
Argentina.  According to Mike, the below listed activities are being pursued 
in Argentina:

Wholesale Origination
Retail Origination
EES
EnronOnline
Power Trading
Gas Trading
Weather Derivatives
Energy Finance
Networks

Although I would be comfortable to leave the workload division up to you, I 
would like to suggest the following (bearing in mind that there is never a 
clear understanding about ""where you draw the line""):

Andrea:  Wholesale and Retail Origination; EnronOnLine; Power and Gas 
Trading; Weather Derivatives; Energy Finance.
Fabian: Wholesale and Retail Origination; EES; Energy Finance.

Please correct me if I am wrong, but it seems to me that there is not a 
significant difference between Wholesale and Retail Origination deals in 
Argentina.  In view of this, I would suggest the two of you assist all 
Origination deals (regardless of being a Wholesale or a Retail deal).  Also, 
both of you should be involved in Energy Finance as I believe such deals 
would arise from Wholesale and Retail Origination transactions.  In short, 
both of you would do legal support to ""Origination"", however, Andrea would 
focus on Trading and Fabian would concentrate in EES type of deals.

In addition, Fabian would manage Luiz Watanabe's workload in Argentina, but I 
would leave this to Luiz to structure and implement.

Kindly let me know if my thoughts make sense to you and please return to me 
with your comments asap.

I have not made any reference to ""Networks"" as I have no idea what it relates 
to ...  Is this related to Enron Communication ?

As a final note, please be advised that our baby should arrive on Thursday, 
July 23.  As of such date, I will be available by e-mail and cel phone only.

"I've chartered in the BVI a number of times and it is a great place to take 
beginners.  I only caught your post of yesterday so didn't see the earlier 
thread.  I'm assuming you're picking up the boat in Road Town or nearby.  The 
only problem with getting away from the dock by 12 or so is if the boat isn't 
quite ready.  I've always used the Moorings so they're the only outfit I 
know.  They don't usually let you get started on the boat until after the 
chart briefing which means you don't go aboard until 10.  If you use their 
provisioning service it eases that chore but sometimes the food isn't there 
right on time.  Having several people (but not too many) around this time is 
helpful to put food away, take inventory, attend boat briefing, etc.  Of 
course, if you get the boat the day before - maybe with a sleepaboard option 
or some such, you have that much more certainty that everything will be done 
on time.  Check with your charter company about attending the briefings 
before sending the last person off to the airport - some companies may 
require 2 people from your boat to attend.

As for first day - if you are away by 1 I suggest heading over to the Bight 
on Norman Island.  There are lots of moorings there and you'll get one as 
long as you're not in too late.  It shouldn't take more than a few hours to 
get there and if it looks like it might be close you can always fire up the 
engine.  There are a couple of places (a beach bar and a boat) to eat and 
drink there if you don't feel like cooking the first night and although you 
can't call it deserted or even secluded because of the number of boats there, 
there is at least very little ashore to bother you.  The caves are just 
around the corner and the Indians right outside for great snorkeling/diving 
either that afternoon or first thing the next day.

Whether you go clockwise or counterclockwise doesn't really matter.  My 
advice running roughly clockwise: 

skip Soppers Hole - just a commercial port with little of interest (unless 
you're clearing customs); 

skip the USVI - all the clearing out & in & out & in can take a lot of time 
and there's plenty to do in the BVI - if you just have to go, the northern 
shore of St. John is the best - nice anchorages (several of the 'secluded' 
variety) without the crime on St. Thomas and the resort at Caneel Bay will 
let you come ashore for a fancy dinner (but make reservations and leave your 
trash on board - there's nowhere to put it); 

Jost van Dyke is fun - anchor in Great Harbor or pick up a mooring in Little 
Harbor - Sydney's Peace & Love restaurant in Little Harbor still has an honor 
bar where you mix your own drinks & just keep track in his little black book 
while you're waiting for dinner, Foxie's in Great Harbor is a classic beach 
bar/rest. - lots of fun and good food & drinks;  

Sandy Cay is everyone's image of a desert island and perfect for a lunch stop 
and a swim; 

don't miss Cane Garden Bay (unless the northerly swell is too heavy) there's 
a wonderful swath of pure white beach with palm trees swaying overhead and 
steel drum bands serenade you into the evening - watch the reefs but the 
channel in is well marked; 

if there's a full moon be sure to be on Tortola somewhere that night (Cane 
Garden works fine) to get to Bomba's Shack for the party - there are lots of 
taxis there as the evening progresses to get you back; 

it's easy to pick people up (or drop them off) at the airport (close to the 
water with a dinghy dock) midweek if you need to and kind of fun to be met 
that way; 

the Baths are a must but VERY crowded (no anchoring allowed - must use a 
mooring) so I'd try to get there as early in the day as possible (Cooper 
Island, Marina Cay and area by Last Resort are nearby for the night before) - 
maybe get up early, motor or sail over and have breakfast once you're safely 
moored - and be careful to use the right color mooring and avoid the ones 
reserved for commercial craft;  

I usually skip Spanish Town (Virgin Gorda Yacht Harbor) since I'd rather be 
at anchor than stuck in a marina slip with no breeze, but if you stay there 
you can get a taxi to the Baths and top off with water in case your crew is 
not serious enough about fresh water conservation (and what crew ever is?); 

the Bitter End is great for a long hot shower (I think you pay at the resort 
front desk) and maybe a 'fancy' dinner and there is also a water dock there 
(10 cents a gal.?).   

Sometimes it seems like the distances are so short you don't get to sail 
enough - you shouldn't have any trouble getting a lot in (but you won't be 
able to see everything).  The only difficulty might be if you need to get the 
boat back in for an early flight but I've let people out at Cane Garden Bay 
to take a taxi to the early flight & then sailed around to have the boat back 
well before noon.  Having said that, I suggest Cooper Island or the Bight for 
your last night - it just makes that last morning a bit more leisurely.   And 
just as I mentioned for the first night, it makes sense to get into most 
anchorages early rather than late so you're sure to get a mooring (in those 
that have them) and don't have to worry about finding a spot for the boat - 
many of them can get quite crowded.  Of course, if you're going anytime 
between now and Thanksgiving there shouldn't be any trouble with crowds - 
just pay daily, close attention to the weather forecasts!

Don't expect much in the way of night life but there are places to eat at 
nearly every anchorage - many are closed in the low season.  A few of the 
islands have some good hiking but there's not much for the sight seers 
either.  But snorkeling and diving are everywhere.  Ask at your chart 
briefing for the best spots these days.  If you have divers along, don't miss 
the wreck of the Rhone - you can have a dive boat come and meet you there and 
bring along equipment and a guide for the divers.  The cruising guide will 
have lots of info on all these issues.

Wish I was going - it's always a blast!

"Hi Evie:
As you know Edison is being, well, Edison about just about everything at the PUC.  I think that we actually have some leverage with PG&E, however.  I've helped to broker a meeting between large customers and PG&E (Tom Botorff and Dan Richard) this Friday at 1:30 PM after DJ's meeting.  DJ and Delainey are organizing
 
The (basic) idea is to see if there is some way to strike a ""reasonable"" deal on the DA/cost allocation issues with PG&E, which could then be submitted to PUC around Edison, which seems hell bent on piling as many costs on business customers as possible.
 
At the first meeting, we want to spend a very brief amount of time determining 1) what matters to people 2) where people on the issues and 3) PG&E's willingness to deal.  The goal is to find out if there's any room for a deal.  Should not take a long time.
 
I hope you can attend, since the meeting will be significantly less productive if you're not there, and who knows, it may lead to something that permits us to go around Edison.  Likely attendees are CMTA, CLECA, the Chamber, you (hopefully), PG&E and me.  Will Mike Kahl be at DJ's meeting?

The new Enron Center Garage has opened and if those of you that have accepted 
spaces at the new garage would please return your Met and Allen Center

waiting list.  The Allen Center and Met cards will be deactivated 
immediately. Please contact Parking and Transportation if you have any 
questions.  You may hand your old card to the security guard at the garage 
exit through the end of this week.

it would great to get it back.  Could you check with Bob/Sarah and see if 
it's floating around someplace over there?  Muchos gracias.

Second, could you do me a favor?  Could you pay me the full amount for Squaw 
and then collect from Cameron for what she owes you?  Sorry to be a pain in 
the ass, but I think logistically, it'll be a whole helluvalot easier to

you stick the check in the mail?  My address is:

"SDG&E filed a Complaint with the FERC that requests an ""emergency order 
capping at $250 per MWh the prices"" for all parties selling into the Calif 
ISO and the Calif PX.   SDG&E claims that the Calif ISO and the Calif PX are 
""fundamentally flawed and inherently incapable of producing workable 
competition"".

EPMI is directly impacted by this Complaint.   Even though FERC has approved 
EPMI's Market-Based Rate certificate after a finding that we had no market 
power, this Complaint would restrict us from selling at above $250 per MWh 
into the Calif ISO and Calif PX.

Government Affairs is responding in two ways --

1. A direct response from EPMI to FERC responding that there has been no 
finding that EPMI has market power and therefore we should not lose our 
market-based rate authority.

2. A response through WPTF (Western Power Trading Forum) and EPSA to argue 
more broadly the facts of what is going on in California (bad hedging by 
SDG&E) and poor market structure rules.

The fundamental problem is that the FERC is running scared about price spikes 
and may, without any real thinking, approve such a Complaint.  SDG&E has 
asked for expedited treatment and a decision could be out as early as mid 
August.

This issue again highlights how important the on-going FERC Investigation in 
Market Issues is for Enron.  We are putting together a detailed plan of how 
Enron will present our recommendations to FERC in this Investigation and will 
discuss this with you.

Call with questions.  

Thanks,

like to determine if ETS and/or NBP would want to send a representative(s), 
although Margaret said she would take copious notes for distribution to other 
key players as necessary.  We should ask Nesbitt how he would structure a 
deal for multiple clients (eg. ETS, NBP, ENA, and maybe El Paso).  

[We need to remain aware of any ""affiliate"" issues that may result, and make 
certain that we are in complete compliance with the regs.]

I will wait until after our meeting with Nesbitt before deciding if/how to 
approach El Paso.  Presumably, if asked to particpate, they would share the 
cost and have independent access to any working model that is developed.

Subject: Dale Nesbitt

John,

I talked to Dale Nesbitt. He suggested that the best way to evaluate his 
model is to
go through a one week intensive project with assistance of somebody from his 
company.
Our cost  is a flat fee of $12,500 that would be deducted from the purchase 
price of $55,000,
in case we buy the software package.

The price of 55K is indicative and will be adjusted based on the required 
level of support.

Dale will be in Houston next week. I have tentatively invited him to visit 
with us on Tuesday,
November 7, at 3:00 p.m. He will adjust if you are busy at this time.


Please, let me know what you think.

Vince

"I will be on the first panel of the FERC California conference on Thursday.  
The format allows a 5 min presentation and then 60 min of Q&A.  I need your 
help to make sure I have ""Gore-like"" command of the details.  Please help 
with the following information:
Enron project information (Parquet/McCubbin) -- please give me any 
presentations or summaries you have on the generation, or firm purchases, we 
have under way (or planned).  I'll talk with you to find out what we are 
comfortable disclosing but please err on the side of giving whatever 
information you have.
Updated Belden presentation (Hain/Belden) -- I believe the latest information 
was as of August; I think some of the information on the cost of peaking 
facilities is particularly eye-opening on the price cap issue.
Comparison to PJM (Hartsoe/Novosel) -- Is the information we are seeking from 
the ISO and PX similar to information PJM already provides?  If so, it would 
be nice to tie our requests back to something the Commission has already 
approved.
Cancelled DSM projects (Mahoney) -- Again, I'll only use what we feel 
comfortable with, but it would help make our point if we can give examples of 
how price caps backfire when it comes to encouraging conservation.
ISO/PX reports (Dasovich).  I have the ISO market surveillance report.  Is 
there another ISO report?  If so, please get me a copy and provide a copy of 
the PX report too.
CEC/Proposed generation update (Mara/Parquet) -- Need the basic information: 
proposed, waiting for permitting; how much/little the legislation did to 
expedite siting (ie are we still comfortable saying that it applies to less 
than 10%)?
Soft cap(Belden/Hain) -- need a crisp explanation of why the ""soft"" nature of 
the cap is not sufficient.  Also, would we be OK if the Commission revised it 
to say that bids can be taken above 150 without special filing or reporting 
requirements, but those bids will be accepted at the price bid rather than 
applying to all lower bids as well (ie the highest bid at or below 150 clears 
the market, bids above 150 accepted at price bid as needed)?
Offers we have made/deals done (Parquet/Dasovich/ Mccubbin) -- Roseville plus 
any others, offer made to SDG&E -- I want to make the point that the market 
will provide solutions (below the retail price cap) if we get the utility 
(and the regulators) out of the merchant function.
Herding the cats(Hartsoe/mccubbin/mara/dasovich):  We are asking FERC to be 
courageous, do the right thing and ignore the politics.  To be even halfway 
credible, we can't have IEP, EPSA, Dynegy or anyone else ""squishing"" on the 
price cap issue..  We have never been closer to reform in California, we need 
these guys on board.
Thanks."

In terms of the method I used to derive the average of $10 million/day, I used the net cash inflows for September and the net cash outflows for October and calculated an average based upon 41 business days.

"Last week, the WSPP drafing group met in sunny California  to continue the 
slow and steady march towards a standardized, ""national"" agreement. Schedule 
C , the service schedule for firm transactions, was the primary topic and the 
following is a summary of where the group is headed.

After much discussion, we proposed  that the group consider the definition of 
firm energy  that Tim, Christian and others have been considering.  The 
following is proposed language (the base was EPMI's version) that the WSPP 
group is currently reviewing:

Firm Power is power that is sold and scheduled in accordance with applicable 
reserve requirements for which the only excuse for the failure to deliver or 
recieve are those set forth in Schedule 3.9 of the WSPP Agreement.  Seller 
shall take steps necessary for the power to be considered Firm Power under 
this definition.

Schedule 3.9 only allows interruption if (i) within agreed recall time, (ii) 
due to an Uncontrollable Force or (iii) power is need for native load; 
provided, however it was agreed that a party would neverless be liable for 
LDs if it interrupts due to native load requirements (this last point is a 
major accomplishment that apppears to have uniform agreement and will be 
implemented in the next draft - the group claimed that the ""optics"" are 
necessary to help traditional utilities).  As a further note, the group 
agreed to do away with all references to C1 and  C2 and have just one 
Schedule.

Changes from EPMI's proposed definition where  the result of the following 
discussions:

1.  Generated vs. Sold - ""Sold"" was elected over ""generated"" because the 
group thinks that it is the receiving control area that determines the 
generator's reserve requirements.

2. ""Schedule""  was added to bolster the scheduling requirements.

3.  ""Reserves"" instead of ""Operating Reserves"" was used because the group 
thought the word operating may be too restrictive.

4.  ""WSCC reserve requirements"" was replaced with ""applicable"" reserve 
requirements because the group thinks that the WSPP Agreement is national in 
scope and should not be limited to WSPP.

5.  References to Non-firm supply as being excluded from Firm Power was 
excluded because the group thought it was redundent  - no control area would 
accept a non-firm supply as being firm.

6.  Power rather than energy is being used only bacause that is the decision 
that has already been made.

This defintion will be further discussed at  the next meeting on Aug 20th in 
Denver.  Prior to that time, I would like to get your thoughts on how this is 
shaping up and what additions/deletions are appropriate.  I look forward to 
hearing your thoughts.

"I have asked Kaye for copies of the CA's referred to.  I agree completely re: 
the need for a procedure.  Let me know what you think about the following:

1. Commercial team identifies the proposed reference entity (RE) and forwards 
the name to Credit.  At the same time, the commercial team should be 
identifying any Enron relationship with the proposed RE and discussing the 
proposal with the appropriate relationship head(s).  

2. Credit reviews the proposed RE and approves or rejects (so far there have 
been many rejections so this makes sense as a next cut).  If approved, Credit 
notifies the commercial team which then forwards the approval to Legal 
together with the results of their investigations regarding other Enron 
relationships.

3. Legal conducts a ""screening"" Confidentiality Agreement review locally and 
forwards the name to the other Enron legal groups for similar review.   If 
the screen reveals confidentiality agreements with the RE or any of its 
affiliates, the commercial team should be consulted to determine the 
appropriate level of further review.  If the commercial team considers the RE 
the subject of legitimate transactional interest, detailed review of the 
confidentiality agreements and their impact may be appropriate.  In addition, 
if the confidentiality agreement screens are passed, Legal should analyze the 
""other Enron relationships"" to determine if they raise any legal concerns.  
Upon final approval, Legal notifies the commercial team (copying Credit).

Something this involved may make sense only for RE's that will be offered on 
the website.  Perhaps a streamlined version would suffice for RE's only 
offered pursuant to an unsolicited request.

"Enron Pres: Still Committed to Power Generation Business
Wednesday, September 6, 2000 12:49 PM	

	
	
	?Mail this article to a friend 
	
	By James Covert 
	Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
	NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Despite an increasing emphasis on wholesale trading 
rather than asset ownership in its electricity operations, Enron Corp. (ENE, 
news, msgs) will continue to develop and purchase power plants, president 
Jeffrey Skilling told Dow Jones Newswires on Wednesday. 
	""Generation assets are essential to a successful trading operation,"" Skilling 
said, responding to recent trade reports that the company plans to exit the 
power generation business. The Houston-based energy company is ""absolutely 
not"" selling its power plants as part of its strategy, he said. 
	Enron will continue to build and purchase natural gas-fired ""peaking plants,"" 
which produce power only during times of high demand and wholesale prices, 
Skilling said. 
	Enron has begun construction of a few such projects in the U.S. Midwest and 
South, and will continue development chiefly in the U.S and Europe, he said. 
	""The margins are higher (in wholesale power markets) in Europe,"" Skilling 
said. ""The market there is more fractional, and that creates more 
opportunities for someone who's playing across the board."" 
	Developments in Europe, particularly in southern Europe, also offer a higher 
per-unit rate of return, Skilling said. 
	Nonetheless, Skilling did confirm that the company isn't interested in 
building larger-sized plants in any country, and that its construction goals 
may not be as lofty as those of other energy companies. 
	""We are not interested in building base-load plants,"" Skilling said, 
referring to large power plants that produce power in steady quantities 
around the clock. 
	""Base load simply delivers megawatts - that's a bulky, undifferentiated 
commodity,"" Skilling said. ""But peaking plants allow us to play on the shape 
of the market of that commodity."" 
	Skilling declined to give any projections or figures related to Enron's 
future development plans, saying that they weren't set in stone. 
	But Skilling said the company generally aims to site power plants where there 
are bottlenecks in the transmission system, and that Enron isn't focused on 
any one geographic region as opposed to others. 
	""There are companies out there saying they're going to build 40,000 
megwawatts by such-and-such a date, and I don't really see how that's 
possible,"" Skilling said. ""There are just too many variables to approach 
markets like that.""

Lynn suggested there might be a fit with your group and I would be grateful

"Please forward to others who need this information.

As you know, Enron's been involved with a group of business customers, small 
customers, labor and enviros trying to hammer out a core/noncore proposal 
that would act as a key modification to Edison's MOU with the Governor.

Today, the Assembly leadership released a bill (AB 82XX) that modifies the 
MOU but does not follow the core/noncore proposal negotiated by the group.  
The bill just came out, is about 80 pages long, and thorough analysis has not 
yet been completed.  The URL for the bill is attached.  Based on a meeting 
attended this morning in Sacramento,the key features of the bill( which is 
attached) are:

Direct Access suspended until 1.1.2003 (suspension presumably effective on 
the effective date of the bill)
Transmission sale at 2X book.
Approximately 90% (or greater) of Edison's undercollection absorbed by 
customers 20KW and above.
Create a Trust to address the money owed to the generators and offer the 
generators 70 cents on the dollar (but does not do away with the suits, 
investigations, etc.)
The bill is completely silent regarding who will pay for the DWR contracts 
and what the payment structure will look like.

Reaction and Timetable
Very chaotic, with considerable uncertainty about where (if anywhere) the 
bill will go, leaving many to believe that bankruptcy remains a strong 
possibility.
Business customers (and of course Enron) are strongly opposed
Republicans are strongly opposed
Labor has big problems with the Tx sale unless they get assurances that TX 
labor jobs are guaranteed, which is not yet included in the bill
We are working with business to remove the Direct Access suspension
We are also working on the Senate side to attempt to get the Senate to 
include Direct Access in their version of the modified MOU, but the Senate 
has been more hostile than the Assembly to Direct Access.
Senate Democrats still intend to run a bill that delinks payment of the bonds 
to repay General Fund for power already purchased from the DWR contracts. 
AB82XX does not address this issue.
Senate Democrats also intend to craft their own version of a ""modified MOU.""  
Word is that the Senate will release their bond language and their ""modified"" 
MOU this weekend or early next week.
The Assembly will hold an ""informational"" hearing on the bill tomorrow 
(Saturday) to get members up to speed
The Assembly will have a committee hearing and vote on the bill on Monday, 
with the intent of sending the bill to the full Assembly for a vote on 
Tuesday.
The Legsilature is supposed to have a month-long recess beginning Friday, 
July 20th, which requires that both the budget and the energy issue get 
resolved by then, or suspend the recess and continue working

Will continue to provide updates as events unfold. If folks have additional 
comments on the bill, please direct them to Harry Kingerski and Leslie 
Lawner, who will ensure that they get into the hands of our lobbyists in 
Sacramento.

If there are any questions, my pager is 888.916.7184.

Best,
Jeff

Hello Vince and Mike

I want to keep you informed.

This year all baskets will be done in a timely manner.
On last year we were going through a major move therefore 
many people played key roles in keeping us together.
This year however , is a little different , as it is always nice
to give unfortunately we can not give to everyone.
I am sending a lists of who we have so far.


There are a few names on the list that  I feel we should do something else 
for this year .
under Shirley's list of names.

(not so expensive)

They are : Move Team                                who?
                     Mail Room                                    who?   
                     Facilities Help Desk                  who?

There are other tokens of appreciation that we can get for them.

Please note that you two are the only ones that have seen this e-mail so far
I will need your approval for all baskets, however your input on the matter 
will be 
greatly appreciated.The list is not completed I am still waiting for 
additions.


                    
                                              Thanks

Hi Vince,

I may have missed something, however don't believe I have received any
communication recently from Andy Festow about this upcoming May 4-5 corp.
fin. conference.  I hope he is still planning to come, yet I don't know as
of now.

I have Andy penciled in as a participant on a ""panel"" that is discussing
equity dilution from stock option compensation (the role of panelist should
require little, if any, preparation time).   Of course, I want Andy to
come, however he is concerned about his ability to attend, I probably
should identify another person or two to serve on the panel.

"Bill -

Sorry for the delay -- I was out of town and believe it or not Enron doesn't 
have a local access number to its computer system in Monmouth, IL so I just 
got your message this morning.

Don't worry about sailing skills.  Among the rest of us we have that pretty 
well covered.  We may be a bit rusty but I'll bet we can keep the boat moving 
in the right general direction and not hit anything hard enough to do any 
serious damage.  We're going to an area that is one of the easiest places in 
the world to sail around for a few days.  Navigation is easy (you can always 
see where you're going), the waters are protected (no big waves) and the wind 
consistent and not too strong (so the boat will move but not be hard to 
handle).  The skills you mentioned (sitting, drinking & socializing) are in 
fact the critical skills for a trip like this.  We sure don't want anyone on 
board who is going to fall down on the job in any of those areas!

If you want a sneak preview, try The Moorings website -- www.moorings.com.  
Under ""Destinations"" we're going to the British Virgin Islands.  Under 
""Charter Fleet"" we'll be on a Moorings 463.

Since you have your tickets, please send me your flight arrival information.  
I need to pass that along to The Moorings so they will pick you up at the 
airport.  About the only other items left to deal with are ordering our food 
and drinks.  Amanda has abdicated any responsibility there so Linda & I will 
take care of most of that.  Any particular beverage requests?  Beer, wine, 
liquor, sodas, juices, mixers?  

And finally, just a bit if extra info:

1.  Your cell phones will not work in the BVI.  We will have a local cell 
phone on the boat but won't know the number until we get there.  If you need 
to leave a contact number with someone, give them the Moorings' number in 
Tortola (284)494-2332.  They'll try and reach us either by phone or radio if 
a call comes in.

2.  A lot of places will take credit cards but we'll need a little cash for 
renting moorings for the night (much easier than anchoring - Amanda can 
explain), meals out, departure taxes, incidentals and whatever but there 
aren't going to be lots of ATM's everywhere so you should bring what you 
think you'll need.  US Dollars are the currency.

3.  You will need your passport but there are no visa requirements.

4.  Use soft-sided luggage (easier to stow  on the boat) and try to carry 
everything on -- if they lose a checked bag it's hard to get it later.  

That's about all I can think of right now.  Feel free to ask any other 
questions.  I'm starting to get excited now too.  It's hard to believe it's 
less than 3 weeks away!

The East Power Fundamentals group has asked that we give a transmission primer for the analysts in their group.  Lance and I have accepted and will be presenting two talks.  I think the same material might be useful for the Research Group at large (perhaps via Thursday staff meetings or Friday brownbags) and/or a few technical corner articles.  Topics would include a glossary of terms/jargon/acronyms, basic concepts (voltage, real and reactive power, transfer limits, loop flow), structure of the network (NERC regions, major hubs, etc), and congestion issues (TLR and FTR/TCC, examples of traditional bottlenecks).  If done in a series, we could also solicit questions for explanation at a subsequent talk (if not answered on the spot).

The talks for East Power are scheduled for Aug 7 and 21 at 3pm.  We could potentially have Research members attend the East Power sessions.

Would you like to have this done for Research and what forum would you prefer?

Thanks,
Martin"

and I have Mobil Oil meter 981040 that I pathed on the first for 30,000 that change to 50,000 for the 3rd.
I didn't path them since they are industrials and Aimee's notes told me to path Industrials -
except for a few exceptions.
Thanks, Julie

Not at all, keep pushing for stellar.  That's what everyone wants.

Things went very well in Portland.  Belden, Kaufman, and Steffes seem very
interested and positive.  It is kind of a culture shock to see young people 
like
Belden carrying so much weight.  Its a refreshing change from most utilities 
and
govt agencies where age seems to be a prerequisite for responsibility, and
reminds me of when your former boss Gigi Coe said to me that the CPUC couldn't
hire more young people because of age discrimination issues (if that's not a
perverse result of a well-meaning policy...).

Whatever happened to Debra Stump, do you know?  She was the GSPP class of 2000

All business related e-mail messages require a prompt response from our business unit.  Therefore, I am requesting your assistance in completing the following tasks:

1)  Grant the necessary access to me to be able to review the incoming e-mails directed to Mary Solmonson since March 1, 2001 through today so that I can determine which ones require a business response that I can handle.   Can these be transferred to my e:mail as a simplified way for me to complete this review?

2) Effective immediately, please create an automatic message for Mary's e-mail box that states ""I am out of the office.  All e-mails are being forwarded to Vanessa Schulte for response.""

3)  Effectively immediately, please route any new incoming e-mail messages to Vanessa Schulte's mail box.

"Attached is the list of PRC meetings that will cover operations for ENA, EIM 
and EGM.  Location, times and attendees are listed for each meeting.  There 
are five pre-review meetings that will take place starting today through 
December 5 in preparation for the Energy Operations PRC meeting that will be 
held on Friday, December 8.  I invite you to sit in on any or all of these 
meetings if you would like to do so.  

The most meaningful meeting will be on  December 8th.  In that meeting, we 
will review the results from the pre-review meetings for Senior Specialists 
and below.  I would anticipate that if at each pre-review meeting the 
preferred distribution is met as instructed, then this portion of the meeting 
will not take too long.  We will then review in more detail the managers, who 
will have been pre-ranked in the pre-review meetings.  We will also review 
and rank the directors and senior directors.  I can also be prepared to 
review my suggested rankings for the three VP's who report to me, with you, 
Wes Colwell and David Oxley in attendance.

"Kevin --

Attached is the East Power RTO Status Matrix as of 12.8.00.  I think that 
we've captured almost all issues (although we may need attributes to add or 
change as we move forward).  

Additionally, given that this is the first time we've put out the matrix, the 
regional people need to confirm the proper response to each attribute (so 
some things may change as I confirm the responses).  As the RTOs are so 
undefined in many cases, we are using our judgement as appropriate.

Hope this is helpful.   My thought is to re-fresh monthly.

Joe -

Thanks for the information.  As I told Cornelio in relation to the EWS - Legal Project, I am currently only responsible for the LegalOnline project and work on this under the authority of Mark Haedicke.  As to the other projects, why and how may name became associated with them is both interesting and incorrect as I am not the ""sponsor"" of any of them.

Last week I received the first indication of the need to discuss these projects in line with ENW's budget approval for ENA projects.  Since a conference call was scheduled for earlier today to discuss these items, I figured I would gather more information and forward that information to the appropriate member of the Dept. for review, consideration and action.  I was advised yesterday that the budget was approved and there was no need for today's conference call.  Despite this budget approval (without EWS Legal discussion), ENW personnel have continued to request that I ""approve"" these projects for next year - even if the approval is only as a ""placeholder"" for the budget.  I cannot do this and, quite frankly, see no value in obtaining these ""approvals"" if the budget has been approved.

If those responsible for these other projects would like me to follow-up with you on these matters and authorize me to do so, I would be more than happy to do so.  Sheila Tweed has actually asked me to do this on the ""extranet"" project, which I will be reviewing with Ed Hearn.  Once we (Ed and I) have reviewed the feasibility study proposed by Cornelio, we will determine the next steps to be taken and whether or not this project should move forward.  I will advise you accordingly.

Mark - these are the answers to your questions concerning our budgets.  Please let me know if this is OK with you.  I would be happy to discuss in person or via a phone call.  Let me know what's best for you.

Your name appearing on 2 projects for ENA?  
1)  ""EWS - Legal"" project. -  Cornelio spoke with you last night and confirmed 1 project actually belongs to Sheila Tweed.  So we will get her to approve.

2)  ""Legal Web Maint.""  - this is really 3 projects, which are:
Legal Web - Enhancements/maintenance for 2001 project converting ""ECT Legal Foreign & Domestic"", ""Jurisdiction Document Library"", and ""European Document Libarary"" Notes applications to intranet apps.  Sponsored by Mark Greenberg.
Physical and Financial Trading, Power Trading, Gas Assets and Industrial Markets Trading Agreements intranet site.  Replaces and expands 3 Master Agreements Notes applications.  Sponsored by Marc Taylor, Elizabeth Sager, Jeff Hodge, Julia Murray.  
ENA Legal Support application. Sponsored by W.L. Schuler
Can you informally approve these 3 projects?

Is this formal commitment to the projects?
No.  This is only a placeholder in the budget for these projects, not formal approval.  You would formally approve the projects once we were ready to start working on them next year.  So, you can agree to put a placeholder in the budget for the project, but cancel it next year before we begin actually working on it.

Here's the basics:
ENA's contract with TW is at a daily rate of $0.0600 (one-part)
The release to Burlington is at a daily rate of $0.0650 (demand only plus applicable commodity and fuel based on usage)
TW will bill Burlington through normal course of business (reservation of $34,125 [$0.0650 x 25,000 x 21days] plus applicable commodity fees)
ENA demand invoice will need to be adjusted so that they only receive a capacity release credit of $32,812.50  [($0.0650 - $0.0025) x 25,000 x 21days]
TW will need to book marketing fee revenues of $1,312.50 [$0.0025 x 25,000 x 21 days]  (Richard - do we need/have a separate account for these revenues??)

Michelle - I know you indicated that ENA is looking to get a payment of $1,312.50 for their portion of the incremental fee charged.  However, we will need to discuss further.  The invoice that will be generated to ENA will not represent a credit due them since we would still be billing them for the first 11 days prior to this release.  

We can discuss further when the billing cycle approaches.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

Elizabeth

  Metropolitan Desk; Section B 
  Debate on Need for New Power Plants Ignores Conservation 
  By KIRK JOHNSON 
    
  09/26/2000 
  The New York Times 
  Page 1, Column 2 
  c. 2000 New York Times Company 

  New Yorkers heard a lot this summer about why their electricity bills were 
going up and
  why a new generation of power plants was needed, and the message centered 
on one
  word: demand.

  Millions of new air-conditioners, computers and other gadgets are humming, 
blinking and
  draining electricity from the power pool, utility executives and state 
energy officials said
  over and over again. The 40 percent jump in electricity rates that many in 
the region were
  assessed in August was only a hint of what could lie ahead, those officials 
suggested, if
  residents did not accept more power plants in their neighborhoods.

  What the public was not told was that the people framing the argument for 
building power
  plants have an abiding interest in selling more electricity. Nor was the 
public told that the
  means already existed to dampen demand and reduce the amount of new power 
needed, if
  the political will could be exerted.

  Before New York's energy markets were deregulated, beginning in 1998, the 
state required
  companies like Consolidated Edison to reduce demand in the system -- 
through energy
  efficiency measures, for example -- if that choice was cheaper than 
building a new plant.

  Under deregulation , that requirement has been lost. In an open market, 
every participant
  wants to sell more energy, and the government agencies in New York and other
  deregulated states that once compelled companies to think of alternatives 
have become
  silent or powerless.

  ''The reliability problems and price spikes in the last two years have led 
to a simplistic set
  of solutions: build more power plants,'' said Richard Cowart, director of 
the Regulatory
  Assistance Project, a nonprofit energy policy institute in Montpelier, Vt., 
that works with
  state regulators and utilities.

  On the new playing field, Mr. Cowart and other experts said, the incentives 
are all
  one-sided.

  Power generating companies have no motive to encourage people to use less 
energy or to
  use it more efficiently because the most money is to be made when demand is 
at its peak.
  And electricity delivery companies make more money by sending more 
electricity through
  their wires. ''The incentive to sell more electricity is overwhelming,'' 
Mr. Cowart said.

  Certainly, demand for electricity is rising in New York and across the 
country, and most
  experts agree that some added generating capacity is needed. And New York 
State's top
  electricity official, Maureen O. Helmer, chairwoman of the Public Service 
Commission, has
  emphasized in her recent speeches that conservation and efficiency measures 
must be
  part of the solution to rising demand.

  The problem, environmental groups and energy analysts say, is that in an 
arena in which
  government has taken a step back through deregulation , it is harder for 
regulators to
  make those opinions count.

  Given the tone of the debate in New York and the sharp jump in prices this 
summer, it
  would be easy for the public to think that the region's energy situation is 
worse than it
  actually is. Most long-term projections for the region say that demand will 
increase less in
  New York State and New York City than in the nation as a whole during the 
next 10 to 15
  years. New York, it turns out, is not an energy hog.

  The most recent official long-term projection for New York, called the 
State Energy Plan,
  issued in late 1998, said the state could get by with only a very modest 
expansion in
  generating capacity for the next 10 years, or no expansion at all if the 
levels of electricity
  that utilities are required to hold in reserve could be modified.

  The rate of growth in demand is also slowing down, not accelerating. Within 
the territory
  served by Consolidated Edison, which includes all of New York City and its 
northern
  suburbs, peak demand, the highest single moment of energy use on the 
heaviest day of the
  year, rose by 1.7 percent a year from the mid-1990's to the end of the 
decade. In the new
  century, that growth rate is expected to be 1.2 percent a year.

  ''It will be more modest,'' one senior Con Ed official said.

  The main implication of those projections, economists and energy analysts 
say, is that
  most of the increased capacity proposed for New York City may not be needed 
at all, at
  least to meet new demand. In the Con Ed service area, meeting a 1.2 percent 
growth in
  demand through new supply alone would require an increased capacity of 500 
to 750
  megawatts over the next five years. Developers and power plant builders 
have proposed a
  total increase six to eight times greater than that in the next three years 
alone.

  ''No one plant can make the argument that it's really needed,'' said Ashok 
Gupta, an energy
  economist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, a private conservation 
group. ''Like
  malls, power plants are now being built for market share.''

  Predicting energy demand is notoriously difficult. In the early 1970's, for 
example, the
  accepted wisdom was that energy use would continue to grow at the rapid 
pace that it had
  in the 1960's. Academics and utility industry officials said the country 
might need 1,000
  nuclear plants by the turn of the century.

  But the oil shocks of the mid-1970's and early 1980's forced the 
introduction of
  energy-efficiency measures that made those forecasts worthless. Energy use 
as a
  percentage of the nation's economy, called energy intensity, began 
declining and has done
  so ever since.

  Some energy officials have said the problem of rising prices and the 
overwhelming focus on
  supply is the result of a still-new electricity market that is not yet 
functioning as intended.

  Theorists who had envisioned competition as the door to a golden age of 
consumer choice
  had predicted that companies specializing in demand reduction -- they sell 
ways to cut
  energy use through technology or better management -- would compete with 
companies
  selling supply. But that has not happened yet. Part of Con Ed's prediction 
of more modest
  growth in demand in coming years is based on the expectation that 
demand-management
  companies will emerge within the next few years, company officials said.

  But state regulatory officials also made the political decision in the late 
1990's to reduce
  spending for conservation and efficiency measures. The state, which once 
led the region in
  financing for alternatives to new supply -- an effort that included 
television commercials
  urging people to think about saving energy -- now spends about a third as 
much per capita
  as most states in the Northeast, including Connecticut and New Jersey, 
according to
  figures from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority.

  Last month, a report filed with the State Public Service Commission 
recommended an
  increase in financing for the efficiency program. The report was produced 
by representatives
  of the electricity industry, working alongside consumer and environmental 
groups. But the
  state's utilities, including New York State Electric and Gas, Niagara 
Mohawk and Con Ed,
  refused to support the final report because they were unhappy with its 
conclusions.

  '' Deregulation undermined the role of utilities in promoting energy 
efficiency,'' said Edward
  A. Smeloff, the executive director of the Pace Law School Energy Project, a 
research and
  advocacy group that helped write the report. As electricity companies have 
become more
  conscious of the bottom line under deregulation , Mr. Smeloff said, 
demand-reduction
  programs have become a threat to profits.

  For utilities that buy most of their power from other companies, moving 
more electricity
  through the wires has become the primary way to increase profits, Mr. 
Smeloff said. ''That's
  the business,'' he added.

  Utility officials say that much of their demand problems come down to one 
hour each year,
  that moment of peak demand when consumers are using the most electricity. 
To a great
  degree, planning revolves around the need to have adequate supply for that 
crucial moment
  so as to avoid blackouts. But experts like Mr. Smeloff say the tools 
already exist to
  dampen those peaks, and reduce prices to consumers as well, if only a 
constituency
  existed to push for the changes.

  Many business and residential energy uses are routine and could be 
postponed for a few
  hours to dampen load on peak days, a plan that efficiency experts say would 
be particularly
  easy in New York City commercial buildings where energy use is centrally 
controlled and
  monitored. In England, one electricity provider created lower rates for 
consumers who ran
  appliances like washing machines and dishwashers in off-peak hours. The 
program became
  so popular that power use in the middle of the night went up significantly 
during the
  discount-pricing window.

  Environmentalists also worry that increasing power capacity beyond the real 
demand in
  New York could create a kind of self-fueling spiral. If too many new plants 
are built, they
  say, prices will probably fall, encouraging people to use more electricity, 
while at the same
  time reducing incentives to save energy or use more efficient products.

  In New York and elsewhere in the country, much of the growth in demand is 
being driven by
  the spread of air-conditioning, especially from people buying extra units 
to cool more parts
  of their homes. Last year, Con Ed began a kind of visual history project in 
which employees
  began regularly photographing 90 apartment buildings in New York City and 
counting the
  number of window air-conditioners. In one year, the total went up by 5 
percent.

  Some energy experts say more air-conditioning could further increase the 
spurts in demand
  that could in turn lead to more power plants, which many scientists say are 
prime sources
  of the greenhouse gases blamed for global warming.

  ''We have hotter summers because of greenhouse gases and more greenhouse 
gases
  because of more air-conditioning,'' said Joseph Romm, the executive 
director of the Center
  for Energy and Climate Solutions, a nonprofit consulting institute based in 
Virginia. ''It would
  certainly be ironic if people decided that the solution was more power 
plants.'' 

  Chart: ''LEDGER: Efficiency Plans'' While New York State makes plans to 
increase its
  electric power supply, it is doing less to promote the efficient use of 
existing power. Graph

Vince - Hrvojesuggested that I drop you a note.  I am with an Austin Ventures portfolio company and we may have room for junior research people (1 or 2).  If there are some analysts or associates in your group who would be interested in talking to us and need a home, please feel free to have them call me or send a resume.  We would talk to anyone who can code option pricing formulas.  JAVA skills, or good Object Oriented programming experience and sufficient mathematical background for the FE work are priorities.  Our Chief Architect would like to see some Database understanding, but that is somewhat more flexible.  American options and Swing options are current issues, although any exotics experience is fine.  I would consider contract/part-time if someone would like to take a project while looking for positions with another larger company.
 
My thoughts and prayers are with you and your group.  I wish we had more immediate needs, but perhaps at the margin this can help.
 
Warm Regards,
Ashley

I have received two additional  requests for help from EES.

1. Jeremy Blachman called and asked us to increase very significantly the 
level of
our support of EES. It probably makes sense to set up a meeting with Jeremy 
ASAP
and discuss specifics (you, me, and it probably makes sense to invite Marty

"James Eckert with Tenn has agreed to have lunch with us on Wednesday.  I 
don't think we all need to go and I don't need to go either.  

He is going to educate us on the VNG contract #47.  The demand charge and 
commodity is discounted effective 11/1/2000.  This is what we know about the 
contract:

MDQ = 16,373 eff 11/1/2000
The 1st 4723/day that we flow is at a discounted  commodity of $.05 and 
discounted demand of $6.08
If we flow more than 4723/day the demand goes to $7.61

What I need to know is exactly how the demand charge will be calculated for 
volumes over 4723 day.
What is the demand charge if we flow 6000/day  for November - 
 is it 141,690 (4723 x 30) @ $6.08 and 38,310 ([6000-4723] x 30) @ $7.61.

Since Koch has told you that they sold the properties to Duke, I would say 
that Duke should be paying us for the gas.

I had heard that Koch sold the properties to another counterparty, but I 
wasn't sure to whom.  I either talked or left a message with someone in the 
settlements area about two months ago about this after Koch informed the 
trader that they should not be getting the invoices.  However, I never heard 
back from anyone. 

This is related to the CES acquisition which came online the first of this 
year.  The deal info we had at the time had this sale booked to Koch.  I can 
change the tickets in Sitara to the Duke counterparty (or create new tickets) 
today if you need me to, so that we can get the invoice out the door.  You 
will still need to coordinate with the contract group in getting the correct 
contract in place for the deal.

I have been billing Koch Midstream Services Co under ENA for meters 
LL-1-0030-Comitas (Sitara #144052) and LL-1-0027-Volpe (Sitara #144049).  My 
former accounting contact at Koch, Michael Thomas, said that Koch sold these 
south texas assets to Duke Energy Field Services back in 1999.  Michael faxed 
a contract which I forwarded to Cindy Balfour Flannigan in the contract 
area.  Cindy said she can't tie the deals in the contract to our system so 
she can't recognize the assignment.  Cindy has left messages with Koch, but 
she has not been able to resolve the issue.    Koch is refusing to pay for 
the gas and there is currently over a million dollars outstanding relating to 
these deals.  I need to find out whether Koch or Duke is responsible for 
paying for this gas.  Do you have any information regarding this issue?

Chris,

Per our conversation, I am attaching  a sample form of ISDA for both a 
Canadian corporate and a Canadian governmental.  With the governmental, the 
proposed form of legal opinion attached to the ISDA Schedule would have to be 
modified depending on your particular situtation (see footnotes in opinion).  
As I also mentioned, we are making some revisions to the guaranty we are 
getting from Hydro-Quebec in response to comments from counsel, and we may 
want to make some of the same changes to guarantees we receive from any 
governmental guarantor.  If you end up having a governmental guarantor, let 
me know and I'll send you down the revisions.

By copy of this email to Joe Hunter on the Confirmation Desk, I am asking him 
to email you copies of the form of Omnibus Confirmation and Annex A thereto 
for an ECC/Canadian Counterparty Deal.  I have to say that if you end up 
transacting with a governmental entity, our form of confirmation will not 
include the reps and warranties required to transact with such 
counterparties, since we never trade financial with governmentals prior to 
execution of a master.  If you go down that road we may have to come up with 
some kind of form, but the best route is to get the ISDA in place first.

Attached is Paul Carpenter (Brattle Group) preliminary findings that 
marketers have market power at the border.

By my second email I'm sending Enron's responses to the pleadings at FERC 
which refute the notion of the need to reinstitute price controls at the 
California border.

Alternatively, a good argument to high gas prices at the CA border is the 
message in Stan's natural gas roundtable speech (i.e. high gas prices can be 
directly attributed to supply/demand factors).

cc: Nelson Neale/NA/Enron@Enron 
Subject: Corn Subsidy Govt Program Analysis

Hi Vince,

 Nelson and I had a meeting yesterday with the Ag Desk folks on how to go 
forward on the analysis and presentation for this program.  The consensus 
from the Ag side was that the choice of university will be highly politically 
driven, ie preferably the university should be from a state that has close 
ties to sympathetic senators or other political figures.  Also it is 
preferable if the university faculty have worked on Ag issues before, lending 
more credibility in the Ag community.  The names that came up were 
Mississippi State and Texas A&M.  Nelson knows of a person at Mississippi 
State who worked with the USDA on risk management issues.
 The needed analysis itself is not necessarily very deep, and the focus is 
primarily to get a non-quantitative presentation out that outlines how Enron 
can take on the downside risk of local crop prices (Enron probably needs to 
cover actual local prices and not simply an index because I do not think the 
govt will want to worry about basis risk). 
 The pilot program itself will be very small, and lends itself to continuing 
down the path of short term trading rather than long term origination.  
Another thought on hedging our potential short positon (on the origination 
side) is that the govt program can only provide a partial hedge to the extent 
of the premium received -- we still have unlimited downside from the short.

Vasant

p.s. I am writing up Jim Bouillion's project suggestion as a potential 
project for Wharton.  Of course, we may still ask Wharton for their insights 
on the corn price protection approach.

FYI.  Hirsch apparently is a business reporter for the Times who got my name from people.  He's doing a story about the contracts.  Something like ""they bought way too much for too high a price.  Now what?""  I told him that I would talk to him under the following conditions:

No attribution to Enron specifically
No attribution of the ""unnamed sources"" sort, ""industry sources"" or sort, etc.
If, when the story's further along, he wants to try to get a quote from us, I'd put him in touch with our PR folks.

We talked generally about DWR, the CA Power Authority, the contracts, the Edison deal with the PUC, etc.

More specifically, he asked me ""are there any alternatives to deal with this mess.""  I outlined the following proposal, which we've talked about internally, and which we've been quietly shopping behind the scenes.  I did not bring up the ""green only"" DA for small customers piece of the proposal (slipped my mind).

I also gave him names of other folks I thought he should talk to.  He said he might get back to me.  If he calls back, I'll let you know.  

Please let me know if anyone has any concerns 1) about talking to him on a backgound only basis, and/or 2) the proposal outlined below. Thanks.

Best,
Jeff

Rick:
Based on your voicemail, here's a quick-and-dirty synopsis of a proposal that I've been quietly discussing with a select few out here in California (e.g., John White, large customers).  It could include more bells and whistles, but the intent of this proposal is to get DA back as soon as possible.
**************************************************************************

Reduce DWR L-T contract volumes by at least 33-50%
To ""back fill"" increase in net-short created by contract reformation, permit noncore customers (20 KW and above) to elect to go DA to fill the position
DA provides a significantly more efficient hedge against price volatility than DWR contracts
Election is first-come, first-serve, capped at the aggregate net short position
Customers decision to go DA will constitute a 3-year commitment to stay DA (i.e., can't go back to IOU for 3 yrs; must stay in the market)
If a net short position remains after noncore customers have elected DA (i.e., not enough elect to fill the net short), then the IOUs will hold an auction to fill the net short
The auction would seek a portfolio of 3 month, 6 month, 1 year and 3 year deals (both peak and off-peak) to fill the net short.
Noncore customers choosing DA would not escape costs of DWR power consumed when the customer was receiving utility service (i.e., prior to electing DA)
Likewise, if the noncore customers choosing DA was a utility customer during the period when the utility accured its ""undercollection,"" (i.e., when wholesale prices exceeded the retail cap), the customer would not escape those costs by virtue of electing DA status
Noncore customers would not bear responsibility for recovery of DWR L-T contracts.
Potential add-on to deal:  Core customers (less than 20 KW) could choose ""green only"" DA, but, like, noncore customers could not escape costs for which they are responsible."
"I should be able to accomodate the schedule.

Parent Guarantee-We feel the dollar amount for the parent guarantee should
be raised from $33Mill to $37mill to allow us some room in case of change

          Subject:  GE Turbine Purchase Contract - Linden 7 site

          Jon and I met with East Coast Power this morning to discuss
the contribution by El Paso of the GE Turbine for the Linden 7 Site.  The
assignment clause in the GE Terms and Conditions currently permits the
assignment by the buyer to an affiliate without GE's consent. The word
affiliate is not defined but we should be able to take the position, as a
49% equity owner in East Coast Power, that it is an El Paso affiliate.  I
would recommend that to clarify, we include the following clause after the
word affiliate in the Assignment Section: (including but not limited to East
Coast Power L.L.C.).  Andrew, Bob and Coralyn, pls advise if you would like
to take a different approach. I also expect that we will have a credit issue
when the Contract is assigned to ECP as GE is now, I believe, getting an El
Paso Energy Corp. Guaranty. According to Bob Licato at ECP, GE accepted an
ECP assignment without an Enron guaranty on Linden 6 due in part to the
presence of GECC as a lender/equity participant in ECP. We can discuss this
with GE when we inform them of the planned assignment to ECP.  Finally, I
would advise that when we get GE to sign a letter accepting the assignment,
we confirm that the GE warranties flow to ECP.

"Steve,

I submitted my evaluation. General impression was rather
negative: he seems to be a consultant type person
who speaks about everything with confidence  but is short on depth
and technical details.

He is personable, outspoken, organized - on the positive
side.

Also, the red flag is that he jumps from job to job: typical after
18-24 months when any organization can ascertain his usefulness.

Hi Vince,

what did you think of David Hsu?

My thoughts.

Overall a good guy. Personable. Intelligent.

He could communicate reasonably well, but seemed to be capable of losing objectivity in favour of technical advancement.

He didn't seem comfortable with taking a man-management role (at least he didn't want to be an 'administrator')

He appeared to know a lot about risk. (In fact Jay Web called me to say he felt David was one of the better risk guys he had seen but also commented that he needed to be coupled with a project manager to be successfull).

By the way, I spoke to Chris Foster and Greg Wolfe about the relative merits 
of Steve Hall and Shari Stack.  Their thinking was that Steve is probably a 
better ""deep thinker"" (to use Elizabeth's words) but that he might be bored 
with the routine transaction work that Shari seems to really enjoy.  He also 
doesn't have the ISDA background which would provide tremendous benefit to 
us.  Therefore, I think Shari is a better fit for our current needs.  

Having said that, I am extremely impressed with Steve.  He has a better 
handle on this California work than anyone I've worked with yet.  He seems 
really bright and responsive.  I talked to him last week about working for 
Enron and he seemed interested.  I didn't get into any details about our 
needs, but gauged his general level of interest in the work that he is doing 
for us and his willingness to consider jobs other than his current one.  He 
basically said that he would be happy to hear about opportunities here.  I 
was talking to Richard Sanders yesterday and he also is impressed with Steve 
and said that he had considered trying to hire him.  I don't know if there is 
a position for Steve or not.  I just wanted to give you feedback on my 
discussions with him.  Let me know if you need any help or information from 
me on this matter.

"If there is a deal shaping up, it's happening by and large through the 
auspices of IEP.  We've thus far decided to maintain an arm's length 
relationship with IEP, choosing not to get too close to the generators.  If 
we want to influence any deal they cut, we'll need to assess how closely 
aligned/associated with them we want to be.  Further we distance ourselves, 
less likely we'll be cut in.  

That said, Sue and I have been participating in IEP's (interminable) 
conference calls and actively weighing in to influence what they do.  There 
was considerable discussion on the last call about developing some sort of 
""price cap"" proposal that could form the basis of a deal, but no discussion 
whatsoever regarding refunds of any kind.  There were differences of opinion 
about the benefits of doing a deal on a cap----Williams is dead set against 
it, Dynegy & Reliant seemed considerably more pliable.  

We reminded folks that there are many other things apart from caps that 
California could do to ""fix"" the problem (e.g., site plants, forward 
contracts, retail market, core/noncore split, etc.), which might obviate the 
need for caps altogether.  We also recognized the political nature of the 
situation and expressed a willingness to discuss a cap that might be 
acceptable, but pointed out our general concerns with caps.

That last meeting provided the impetus for the 28th press conference, at 
which (hopefully) a large number of stakeholders with urge the Governor and 
the PUC to get off the dime and do something concrete that can help---develop 
a rational policy for forward contracting by the IOUs and abandon the ""PUC as 
counterparty"" policy that currently exists.

Again, haven't heard a peep about any deal on refunds.  Will check around, 
though.

Do you think that there is a deal in the works and we are ""out in the rain""?  
I have to doubt that DENA or Southern are willing to give $ back to 
California.  Maybe Reliant would.

Subject: Report of Editorial Board Meeting with the San Diego Union-Tribune

IEP's public affairs consultant arranged an editorial board meeting for me 
while I was in town for the NARUC meeting.  Present were Don Sevrens, news 
editor/insight section; Bill Osborne, senior editor/opinion; Jim Gogek, 
editorial writer; Bernie Jones, editor, opinion pages; Craig Rose, the 
reporter who has written extensively on the topic, and a photographer.

My two primary messages were that (1) wholesale and retail competition is 
working elsewhere, particularly in Pennsylvania, and can eventually work in 
California if the rules are changed, and (2) California has a severe supply 
shortage and needs to focus on providing incentives for new generation and 
expediting the permitting process.  I was subtly trying to get across the 
message that leadership was needed to help Californians deal with the need to 
reconcile their environmental and land use goals with the need to bring their 
power supply and demand into balance.  I, of course, defended FERC's order on 
the causes of the price volatility in California this summer and their lack 
of any authority to order retroactive refunds.  I also pointed out that there 
were no findings of individual market abuse, so that refunds wouldn't be 
warranted even if there was legal authority.  I also pointed out the problems 
with price caps.

Other than Craig Rose, who disagreed with me any chance he got, the others 
asked good questions and seemed to be listening.  They made the point 
repeatedly that this matter is very political, suggesting that a political 
compromise with the generators/marketers is necessary.  One of them said he 
had heard there was a deal with the generators being negotiated and asked me 
my position.  I responded that I had no response.  Anything like that is the 
business of individual members.

They indicated that they expected to do a story for this coming Sunday's 
Insight Section.  Please give me any feedback you have.

"Steve,  We are currently negotiating an interconnect agreement for an upgrade 
of an existing interconnect off the Trawick System into TUFCO.  The 
interconnect is solely a delivery to TUFCO.  We are down to one point of 
difference in the agreement.  

Typically HPL disclaims any liability for consequential damages to the other 
party.  TUFCO is asking for an exception for any violation of gas quality 
specifications.  This would mean that if HPL delivered off spec gas to TUFCO 
which required cleanup of their pipeline system or caused damage to a 
customer of TUFCO's HPL would be liable under this Agreement.  

From a legal standpoint, we can make this exception, but I wanted to make 
sure everyone understood and agreed with the acceptance of this potential 
liability.  Assuming we are properly monitoring all our receipts there 
shouldn't be an issue. 

Please let me know what you think about this situation.  I can forward a copy 
of the interconnect agreement if you do not currently have one.   "

Brian,

What about meeting around 5:50 - 6:00 p.m. at the Angelica Movie Center
on Smith. There is an underground parking between Smith and Louisiana
and the movie theater will validate your parking ticket.

There are several bars at the center.

The movie starts at 7:00 with some boring speeches. Saturday should be more
interesting - it's a comedy day.

"I need you to run these items by Rick.  I take full responsibility for 
approving the hiring of the Hills firm (and I look forward to meeting with 
you and Carla as we discussed), but remain hopeful we can use their services 
for something other than WTO.  In the wake of Seattle, and as I have come to 
understand better what the WTO can and cannot do for us on the energy 
services front, I have come to the view that our talent and money would be 
better spent on other activities.  My inclination is to do the bare minimum 
necessary to keep the machine going.  If we have specifically committed to 
certain things, then let's follow through.  If there are things we can avoid, 
let's avoid them.  Specifically with respect to Fischer going to Geneva, Why 
not have him available by phone at all hours to provide assistance and mage 
that known to USG instead of underwriting additional travel.  With respect to 
the Hills firm, can we use the retained time to help with the specific 
strategies we are now working out for the regions?  These are the kinds of 
things we need to consider.

Subject: Enron and the Energy Services Issue Before The WTO

Steve: This is a brief extension of our conversation yesterday afternoon 
putting in print some of the upcoming dates and possible committments for 
your consideration and decision.

We have no exit strategy at this time and in order to follow your general 
instructions to withdraw gradually (I'm not quite certain that is possible at 
this stage) you need to know the following.

The April meeting at the WTO in Geneva (Committee on Specific Committments) 
spent considerable time discussing how energy services would be considered in 
the WTO GATS (General Agreement on Trade and Services) . The USTR raised the 
issue, tabled the issue and guided the discussion. We did not send anyone to 
that session.

As planned for several months, we issued the Rachel Thompson study which is 
completing its basic distribution now. There has already been considerable 
interest in the study and I fully expect it to generate discussion in the 
days ahead. I have sent you the correspondence from the Japanese Ministry. 
Tonight I am hosting a small dinner for the top staff person for the leading 
Japanese business organization affiliated with the CSI organization. He 
raised the issue of Japan's industry feeling energy services was going too 
fast too soon when Ken addressed the WTO Ministerial Forum last December in 
Seattle. Now he has told Bob Vastine, president of CSI that he was told later 
by his collegues that his statement was a misstatement. We'll hear more 
tonight.

Later today, the ESC Executive Committee is meeting with the DOE to discuss 
how they can support energy services for the USTR who has lacked technical 
advisers since Donna Bobbich and Russ Profozich left DOE earlier this year. 
DOE has appointed a group to help USTR and this is an orientation meeting 
held at their request.

Next week I have scheduled the first ESC full meeting since January to update 
members (now 50 since Schlumberger joined on Friday) on developments which is 
essentially a report by USTR Carol Balassa who is the responsible official 
handling energy services.

She has given a couple of us a debriefing on what happened at the WTO meeting 
and a request to prepare more detailed information for the May 10 meeting in 
Geneva where she tells us that energy services will be even more involved in 
the discussion. We should have Bob Fisher go to that meeting to be of 
assistance. This is a decision point for you.

We have made some other committments which are also decision points although 
the Helsinki meeting on June 18th has been agreed upon based on my feelings 
that when I discussed it (the SCO/FSN Showcase Europe) in Houston with you 
and Rick, you raised no objection which I took as agreeing that it should go 
forward.  We have done this meeting annually where I have brought in someone 
from Enron companies to brief them and host them for dinner. These are the 
commercial people in the US embassies throughout Europe and the former Soviet 
Union. They are important points of contact for our commercial people.  This 
year they want to have energy services in the WTO and as we would like them 
to exist in their territory. A few members of the ESC Executive Committee 
will do the former and Peter Styles the later. I have organized the dinner.

Following that meeting is one that EC Trade staffer Uta Klinkers wants the 
ESC Executive Committee to put on in Brussels which is a joint meeting she is 
organizing with European energy industry representatives. This is a dialogue 
on energy services. The EU is an important player in the WTO and Uta, who 
recently met with the ESC Executive Committee in Washington is quite 
supportive of liberalized energy services. At the EC she reports directly to 
Commissioner Pascal Lamy. Rick's memo this week suggested we have Peter 
Styles do this briefing. Peter is not an American and is not affiliated with 
the ESC. Therefore, unless we participate, Europe's energy industry is not 
talking with US industry. If this is what you want, then I should tell Uta 
that we are unable to do the meeting.

The last meeting is the presentation by Ken Lay at the OECD Forum 2000 on 
June 26 which I engineered with Doug Worth, Secretary General of the BIAC 
(Business Industry Affairs Committee) to the OECD. This is a major world 
conference and Ken is addressing e-commerce and services. Doug, an American 
and former head of the Washington IBM office wants to have Ken meet with OECD 
Commissioners in a smaller meeting to discuss trends for the future.  I had 
planned to be there with Ken for the day, day and a half he will be in Paris. 
I introduced our company to the OECD several years ago and it has become 
increasingly involved in issues of interest to us.

Well, these are the near-term items that require your fine hand if we are to 
proceed. A dramatic drop off at this time will have its effects and no one is 
likely to pick up our leadership. There is growing support for what has been 
accomplished and the USG plus others are now hooked on the energy services 
agenda. I cannot easily see an exit strategy that can do anything but cause 
criticism at this point. This is definately a longer term committment that I 
thought we had made when approval was given to hire the Hills firm. However, 
if you want to exit, other than pulling back from the Brussels meeting, I 
think the other meetings are firm committements at this point.

These are some thoughts for your consideration and decision.

Joe

Sean Crandall said the price on this is correct (241), but he thought the 
deal was supposed to run through the end of the month. He was just walking 
into a meeting with Tim Belden while I was trying to figure this out with 
him, and he asked that I not change anything until he gets out and can look 
at it more closely. A price of $141 is awfully low for a peak deal flowing at 
Mid-C tomorrow - actually lower than the off-peak prices - so it sounds a 
little suspicious. I'll let you know when he gets out of the meeting.

Hey Gerald!
 I'm doing O.K.  How are you?  Mon. and Tues. were busy, but the rest of
the week shouldn't be too bad.  The research project is going well,
except that a lot of the articles we need have to be ordered because our
libraries do not carry the journals.  That's probably typical though.
Tomorrow we have a big meeting with my prof to come up with an outline
for the project, so things should really start falling into place pretty
soon. Starting next Mon. I will be volunteering for the Health-for-all
clinics Health Educator (we have to volunteer for one of my classes).  I
will be helping diabetics and people with high blood pressure plan their
diet and physical activity schedule.  I'm pretty excited, but still need
to read up on nutrition since I am a little rusty.
 Denver, huh?  It will be so beautiful.  I've only been to Colorado once
to ski.  I wasn't too big on the skiing thing, but I did enjoy the
scenery.  You will have a great time.  Do you like that you have to
travel every once in a while for your job?  I would think that it would
be nice to get out of Houston every once in a while.
 Did it rain in Houston last night?  THere was a huge thunderstorm here
around 4:30a.m.  It almost sounded like it was hailing for a minute, but
I don't think it did.  I heard Ft. Worth got it pretty badly.  Three
people were confirmed dead today.  On a lighter note, have fun on your
trip!

 I'm not so sure about the Nobel Prize thing, but hey... it would be
nice.

		 Subject: Re: Brief in Rate Stabilization Proceeding

Jeanne - you shouldn't compromise Enron's prior statements on ending the rate 
freeze.  The most important thing is that we not get a retroactive end of the 
rate freeze (retroactive to any time before the date of the order).  We may 
also accomplish this through legislation.

Regarding the book vs. market valuation, it is less important that we argue 
for market or book than it is we should clarify for the commission how and 
why it should be consistent with the new legislation.  If new legislation 
occurs and means that utility generation will be priced at cost for 10 years, 
then everyone needs to realize that is a fundamentally different construct.  
DA Customers are not getting the value of these plants through the valuation 
process so they must have access to that value through the access to retained 
generation approach. If cost based rates are not legislated, market valuation 
shoud proceed.  What we don't want is for them to legislate cost-based rates 
and then forget about the value being stripped from DA.

Also, seems like it could be a good thing to point out that if they do 
declare an end to the rate freeze, if it is effective before new replacement 
legislation is enacted, they've only created another quagmire.   I'll call to 
discuss.

		 Subject: Brief in Rate Stabilization Proceeding

Despite the fact that the hearings will probably continue into Wednesday of
this week, the briefs in Phase I of the Rate Stabilization Proceeding are
still due this Friday the 2nd.  One of the issues before the  ALJ is the use
of interim versus final market valuation to end the rate freeze.  I am very
hesitant to say that the rate freeze cannot end on the basis of a Commission
approved interim valuation as Enron has, in previous proceedings, taken the
position that it can.  Please let me know right away if you feel different
about this.  Along these same lines, the issue of the value of the assets is
somewhat at play (at least on an interim basis).  Do we want to take a
position that the assets need to be market valued (rather than book) thus
increasing the rate base for the purpose of cost of service regulation which
the assets are now under? Increased generation rate would mean an increased
DA credit. However, it may also hurt our claim that we should get a piece of
the retained generation.  Again let me know as soon as possible about your
position.

Please let me know what equipment you will need for your presentation, so it
will be available in the room in advance.  The location has changed to the
18th floor at the Chase Center. I'll forward the address.  All else remains
the same. Thank you.

   Vince, I know you must be very busy given the recent press. Hopefully,
   this
   has not changed your ability to speak to the Houston Energy Group.  The
   title of your presentation is needed to include on the meeting notices.
   If
   you can provide a copy of your presentation, NACM will count this toward
   the
   attendees continuing education units.  Not all speakers have something
   to
   provide, but if you do and you don't mind sending it, it is certainly
   appreciated. To get the presentation approved for CEUs, the info is
   needed
   as soon as possible. Please advise.
   Thank you.

      have plenty of time to get to the airport.

      Please, feel free to invite guests from other industries. I shall

to the CAED I.  There will be one for CAED II as well.  This document is 
being reviewed by the bank, so I'm not convinced it is in final form.  You 
will note that there is an acknowledgement section for GE.  I cut and pasted 
from the consent to assignment from the TurboPark documents, but shortened 
the whole thing considerably.  Here's that document:



4.  Signature pages (signed by Enron) from the ESA deal, both the facility 
agreement and the override letter.  Obviously, we need your signature.  


I will forward the final CA facility agreements to you once again, along with 
the blacklines against what you initialled.

I finally got to speak with Mike yesterday. The short answer is that Nora 
Dobin in Global Finance legal will be your contact person on everything other 
than the swap. Mark Taylor (or his designee) will handle the swap.

We will rely heavily on Ron Astin and Trena Chandler of V&E to assist us on 
the Whitewing issues. In case you didn't know, Ron and Trena represented us 
in the creation of Whitewing (and its holding company Condor) and have been 
involved in all the subsequent Condor/Whitewing transactions. Because Jeff 
Eldredge has a significant role in Margaux, I hope having V&E involved here 
and in London will facilitate coordination on these issues.

Subject: Margaux/Whitewing


Ron/Trina/Ben,

I wanted to touch base with you on some Margaux-related issues for Whitewing 
and determine what the appropriate course of action is.  

As a brief description of the Margaux transaction, in case you have not been 
updated recently, the Margaux transaction will now occur through the 
synthetic transfer of risk to the Noteholders/Margaux equity.  The method by 
which this occurs is as follows.  Whitewing continues to hold the equity 
interests in the assets (excluding 56% of Trakya, ETOL, approx. 31.25% of 
Sutton Bridge, 50% of Nowa Sarzyna, and approx. 50% of Teesside, all of which 
are held by Enron).  Whitewing enters into a fixed for floating swap with 
ENA, with Whitewing making a fixed annual payment to ENA in an amount 
representing the base case cash flows of the underlying assets and ENA making 
a floating payment to Whitewing that is initially equal to the fixed payment 
from Whitewing but is adjusted downward if certain identified negative things 
happen at the various projects (thereby transferring certain of the risks of 
the projects through the floating leg).  Concurrently, Margaux (the Issuer) 
raises approx. $511 mm of capital and, through a whollly-owned subsidiary, 
purchases the floating leg (receiveable) from Whitewing for $511 MM.  In 
other words, Whitewing enters into the swap and immediately monetizes its 
receiveable to Margaux.  The net result is that Whitewing receives cash 
proceeds up front, and has a fixed payment obligation to ENA, and ENA has a 
floating payment obligation to Margaux.  I've attached a structure diagram 
below.

With this in mind, the following issues related to Whitewing have arisen.  
The tax group would like to characterize the payment ENA receives from 
Whitewing as a preferred partnership distribution (see attached note from 
Donette Dewar below).  My question is how do we achieve this result.  First, 
is Whitewing LP able to enter into this transaction itself, or does it need 
to occur at a subsidiary level?  In other words, does the swap fall under the 
definition of ""Indebtedness"" (clause (viii) perhaps?) in the Whitewing LP 
Agreement, which is prohibited at the Whitewing level?  If it cannot, is SE 
Acquisition the best candidate to be ENA's counterparty, or do we run into 
issues with the Natwest facility (although they'd likely consent since they 
will get repaid out of the proceeds of the transaction)?  Once the issue of 
who is the appropriate counterparty has been determined, we need to discuss 
the mechanics by which we effect the transaction.  If we are indeed going to 
open up the Whitewing LP Agreement, I suspect that AnnMarie will need to 
revisit the Allocation and Distribution sections, which is probably no easy 
task.  If not, and the transaction will occur at a subsidiary level, we need 
to determine where.  Also, I'm sure this transaction will require 
Certificateholder approval as it is in excess of the $40mm threshold.  A 
final logistical issue that Donette raises in her note is who will be 
responsible for the legal work required at the Whitewing level.

More generally, are there any other legal or other issues that you see with 
respect to this transaction from a Whitewing perspective?

If you'd like to discuss the transaction further, please let me know.  I'll 
be in Houston the early part of next week, so perhaps we can spend some time 
discussing these issues then.  Thanks, and I look forward to seeing you next 
week.

Best regards,

Stuart

Subject: Margaux - Whitewing Partnership amendment

As you may recall, the tax comments to the debt term sheet reflected a need 
for an amendment to the Whitewing partnership agreement to admit ENA as a 
partner. You also may recall that we briefly discussed the potential for 
legal/accounting/other issues that may arise as a result of any such 
amendment.  So that the Whitewing process can be moved forward, would you 
please consider the following:

1. Have any legal/accounting/other issues been identified as resulting from 
an amendment to the Whitewing partnership agreement?

2. If so, what are the potential solutions to any such issues?

3. Have definite conclusions been reached regarding the economics of ENA's 
preferred return on the Whitewing interest, such that a draft of the 
necessary partnership allocations can be undertaken?

4. Has a decision been made regarding who will be charged with drafting the 
amendments?  Will it be the Margaux legal team?  The Houston Global Finance 
legal group?  Other??

Thanks, in advance, for your consideration of these issues.

Kindest Regards,

DMD

"No, the ETA says that if you have a master agreement in place it governs 
trades in the relevant commodities.  In fact, we used that language to 
mollify the people who were afraid we were going to stop sending confirms 
when they first signed up for EnronOnline.  To the extent we want to 
eliminate confirms for counterparties with masters, we will need their 
agreement.  

From a technical legal perspective we could probably eliminate the confirms 
for GTC-governed  transactions without asking the customer first.  Whether or 
not that is a good idea from a customer relations/marketing/PR view I will 
leave to others.  Since some customers seem to want this pretty badly, you 
might consider offering to do away with the paper for customers who sign up 
for your new data transfer arrangement before making it generally 
available......

Vince,
 
I talked to Sean, and asked him to prepare Zhiyong for our meeting with him.
Zhiyong and Sean had an agreement that Zhiyong would support Sean when the
time comes for Sean to transfer to Research.  
 
Unfortunitely Zhiyong can not make it for Friday's meeting because I just heard he
had a car accident and may stay in hospital for a week (flower?).  Sean will visit Zhiyong
in the hospital and will bring up this issue. I think as long as we allow Sean to have
enough time for his transition (help Zhiyong out), Zhiyong would agree. If Zhiyong did
not make any noise, things should be just fine.
 
 
Zimin
 
PS: Thanks for the support you have been giving me. I think that Paulo and I will work out
things to maximize the Research value.

Colleen,

I think the reason that they haven't moved has been one of timing.  Chris has 
not had time to pull them out of their spreadsheets and put them onto 
another.  This, of course, has led to the obvious point that we are still not 
comfortable using the service P&L from unify.  When Scott gets back next 
week, we will together with him and Dick to verify what needs to be moved and 
take care of it manually until system resources can handle it.

Is there some reason why we are not allocating demand charges for the market 
area pipes to the Market East p&l?  If the only reason is that you're not 
sure which ones to do, this is my suggestion.  It seems to me that there are 
only three pipelines where there is overlap and that would be Tennessee, 
Texas Eastern and Transco.  For now, why don't we leave all the demand 
charges for those three pipes, plus all others not listed below, with the 
East p&l, and move the following pipe demand charges to the Market East 
book:  Algonquin, Columbia Gas Transmission, Columbia Natural Resources, CNG, 
Cove Point, Equitrans, Gatherco, Iroquois, Marco, National Fuel.

Obviously you need to confirm this with Dick and Scott, but this seems to 
make sense to me.  Please advise.

Hi Kay.  Thanks for this input.  My somewhat knee-jerk reaction has been that 
NEPCo is, indeed, taking a very aggressive approach.  We are also hearing 
that they are under some sort of ""mandate"" to include these provisions in 
their contracts on a going forward basis (I think I might have some idea of 
what that's about), but we are obviously concerned that it won't fly with a 
third party buyer of our project.  Dean, Jim Fowler (our outside counsel at 
McCutchen) and I may want to chat about it with you further.

On a related note, I keep running into the need to have a more basic 
understanding of the West LB documents and the GE LM-6000 contract than I 
have.  Do you have copies of those documents, and could I ask you to have 
copies made and sent to me?  Much appreciated.

Hope all is well,

Subject: Re: EPC Limits of Liability  

NEPCO's position sounds more typical for a cost plus contract.  Is this a 
lump sum deal? If so, then I think NEPCO is taking an aggressive approach to 
both LOL and retention.  A 10% limit of liability during the warranty period 
is particularly aggressive, unless there are a lot of carve outs to the limit 
of liability, and other give-and-takes which make it make sense. Another 
factor which might make a difference is the treatment given to the GE 
contract.  Is NEPCO taking risk on GE performance, and is the dollar value of 
the GE equipment included in the price used to figure the % of liability?

I'm glad to discuss this if I can be of help.

Kay

Subject: EPC Limits of Liability

Kay - Ron Coker in the CTG group suggested you might be able to help with 
this.

ENA/SF is in the middle of negotiating the EPC contract for Pastoria (750 MW) 
with NEPCO.  We have hit a couple of snags in the contract and would very 
much appreciate your input as to what is ""market."" 

1. Limit of Liability -  NEPCO would like 80% up to Substantial Completion, 
40% up to Final Acceptance, and 10% for the Warranty Period.  GE's LOL is 
100% of their contract value though the warranty period. (which Kiewit also 
agreed to on Pittsburg.)
2. Retention - NEPCO would like to have 10% retention on payments only for 
the first 5% on the contract value and then 5% retention thereafter.  We 
would prefer 10% throughout the payment schedule.

What do you think?  We want the Owner's position to be as strong as possible 
to enhance the sale of the project, but NEPCO is under a great amount of 
pressure to reduce their contingent liability, and we really don't want to 
leave them holding the bag once we are gone if it is not necessary.

Mark --

Thanks for the additions.  I will add to the Asset / Responsibility Matrix.

The definition I have been using is that Regulatory Risk is a subset of=20

Risk is a ""legal"" action taken by a government or its agent which modifies=

Currently the Regulatory Risk Working Group (Fiona Grant is member) is tryi=

Anna,

I just wanted to confirm with you that all fuel & liquids customers, 
including those from Singapore, are being handled by credit in Houston now 
that the responsibility for Global Products has moved from London to Houston. 
I spoke with Sheri Thomas & Tom Moran (Houston credit) this morning & they 
both agreed that these (Asia Pacific) counterparties should now be handled by 
Houston. However there still appears to be some confusion over this issue so 
I would appreciate it if you could send a reply confirming that this is the 
understanding at your end so as to avoid any further confusion.

Many thanks

I spoke with Frank Davis in Houston yesterday about this PA and he agreed 
that Houston PCG would ensure that this customer was reviewed in Houston and 
set up as soon as possible.  I have also confirmed with Frank and Amita 
Gosalia the situation with regards to responsibilities for Japan when 
processing PAs.  Japan has always been the responsibility of the Houston PCG 
except in the case of metals customers which are approved by credit and legal 
in London.

It would seem that this is an issue that needs to be discussed further 
between the London, Houston and Australia groups to establish responsibilites 
further. Hopefully this will ensure that this type of confusion does not 
occur again and delay the processing of a customer application.

I put Idemitsu's PA into the database  for credit review on Sept 26 & it was 
picked up by John Suttle in Houston. I haven't heard anything since & seeing 
as they appear to be a fuel & oils customer I have today changed the RAC to 
London so that the PA can be processed over there, which is probably where it 
should have gone in the first place. I apologise for the delay and

Houston as to where Asia Pacific fuel & oil customers should be processed.

5 State Energy Advisors Fired Over Conflicts Ethics: The consultants were 
involved in buying electricity for California from a generator whose stock 
they owned, setting up a clash of official duties, personal interests.
JEFFREY L. RABIN; DARYL KELLEY; RICH CONNELL
TIMES STAFF WRITERS

The Davis administration, stung by charges of excessive secrecy, disclosed 
late Friday that it has fired five energy consultants because of conflicts of 
interest involving their official duties and personal finances. 
A sixth consultant hired to help California purchase electricity has quit, 
according to state records.
All were involved in purchasing electricity for the state from a generator 
whose stock they owned. 
In addition, the top lawyer for the agency buying the power was removed from 
her position because of concern about the way the issue of potential 
conflicts was handled. 
Top advisors to Gov. Gray Davis told The Times that they learned of the 
conflicts in the last week, after belatedly asking the consultants to file 
required economic disclosure statements. A review of those documents, which 
included stock holdings, showed that some of the consultants ""may have 
crossed the line,"" said the governor's senior advisor, Nancy McFadden. 
State law prohibits officials from participating in decisions involving their 
personal financial interests. 
Although portraying himself as seriously concerned that such conflicts could 
undermine public confidence, the governor has not required some of his most 
influential private-sector advisors to file the kind of disclosure statements 
that led to the firings. 
Among them are two Wall Street veterans who have been most influential in 
promoting the governor's energy rescue plan, which includes the largest state 
bond sale in U.S. history. 
The New York firms that employ executives Joseph Fichera and Michael Hoffman 
have been paid $275,000 a month to, among other things, help pitch the 
$12.5-billion bond issue to Wall Street analysts and state lawmakers. The 
companies stand to make an additional $14 million if the state goes through 
with the purchase of utility transmission lines. 
Davis contends that Fichera, Hoffman and their associates fall into a 
separate category of advisor, beyond the reach of the state's political 
reform laws. Critics question the distinction. 
""The governor's approach may be convenient for him,"" said Jim Knox, executive 
director of the watchdog group California Common Cause, ""but it ignores the 
law."" 
Disclosure is crucial because the public needs to know that ""decisions are 
not being made by people who have a conflict of interest,"" Knox said. ""Trying 
to evade the law with a creative use of semantics is not what they ought to 
be doing."" 
The firings disclosed Friday are unlikely to diminish criticism surrounding 
the more than 50 consultants and advisors hastily hired by the administration 
as it rushed into the power trading business this year. 
More than $25 million is being spent by the state on consultants, according 
to state records. 
In the process, seemingly little attention was paid to routine government 
ethics laws. 
It took six months for state officials to direct the consultants to file even 
basic disclosures of their personal finances, including investments. The 
state Political Reform Act normally requires such forms to be filed publicly 
within 30 days of starting work for state agencies. 
Even with the hastily ordered disclosures made public thus far, the 
circumstances of most of the stock transactions remain a mystery because key 
information was omitted. Most of the consultants, for example, failed to 
state when they bought the energy stocks. 
One of those pressing hardest for an investigation of possible conflict of 
interest violations and insider trading is Secretary of State Bill Jones, a 
Republican who hopes to challenge Davis next year. Jones has accused the 
governor of ""a conscious policy of secrecy"" in enforcing compliance with 
public disclosure laws. This week Jones called for a federal Securities and 
Exchange Commission probe of stock purchases by state energy consultants. 
4 Traders Owned Shares of Calpine 
The four traders removed this week all owned shares of Calpine Corp., a San 
Jose-based power generator that has landed the largest share of the $43 
billion in long-term state power contracts. Their investments ranged from 
several thousand dollars to more than $100,000, records show. 
While working for the state Department of Water Resources, officials said 
they bought undetermined amounts of Calpine power on the state's behalf. More 
than $14 million worth of electricity was purchased from the state by Calpine 
in the first quarter of this year, according to the most recent records 
available. 
""We did not want them making governmental decisions and holding these 
stocks,"" the governor's legal affairs secretary, Barry Goode, said in an 
interview. 
The highest-ranking consultant removed, Richard Ferreira, was hired on a 
$500,000 contract in January to assist in obtaining bids for long-term power 
and negotiating contracts, records show. 
A former assistant general manager with the Sacramento Municipal Utility 
District, Ferreira was paid $200 an hour by the state. After he disclosed 
owning as much as $10,000 in Calpine stock, officials discovered he had 
participated in a review of one of the company's contracts. Ferreira could 
not be reached for comment. 
The governor's office identified the other four as traders William F. Mead, 
Herman Leung, Constantine Louie and Peggy Cheng, most of whom could not be 
reached Friday by The Times. 
All of them formerly worked as energy schedulers at the Power Exchange, a 
now-defunct energy market similar to a stock exchange created in the early 
days of California's electricity deregulation. 
Hired by the state in February and March, the four signed temporary contracts 
calling for maximum payments of between $15,000 and $21,000 a month, 
including living expenses in Sacramento and flights home to Southern 
California. 
Mead, 55, a former Edison engineer, said state officials never warned him 
that owning energy stock was a problem until they demanded that he sell the 
stock a week ago. 
He said he bought nearly all of his shares 2 1/2 years ago for $12,000 and 
saw its value skyrocket as the stock split three times, doubling in value 
each time. 
Mead said he was called by the head of the state's energy buying team 
Thursday and fired. 
""I asked very directly, 'Is this because of the stock?' and they wouldn't 
give me an answer,"" Mead said. ""[He] just said your services are terminated. 
""I came up here, away from home, living in a hotel room, trying to keep the 
lights on, trying to get the state through a crisis and now I get a finger 
pointed at me as if I'm some sort of criminal. I guess it's just politics and 
we're the pawns."" 
Administration officials said they also are examining the actions of other 
traders, including one who bought Calpine stock just before beginning work 
for the state. That trader, Elaine Griffin, who also came from the Power 
Exchange, left the state power buying operation July 14, three days after 
disclosing her energy industry investment. Griffin, who the governor's office 
said had obtained another job, could not be reached for comment. 
Griffin reported purchasing $10,000 to $100,000 of Calpine stock on Feb. 1, 
in her final days working at the electricity exchange. 
A few days later, Calpine signed and announced a $4.6-billion, 10-year deal 
to sell power to the Department of Water Resources. 
On Feb. 20, Griffin joined the state power buying agency, just as the state 
and Calpine were finalizing an additional $8.3 billion in power contracts. 
One of those, a 20-year deal signed Feb. 27, was the longest. 
The state has awarded Calpine about $13 billion in contracts to supply power 
for up to 20 years. 
In addition to the state consultants who bought Calpine stock, two others 
reported owning stock in Texas-based power marketing giant Enron Corp. And 
two more bought stock in Southern California Edison, the faltering utility 
that Davis has committed himself to saving from bankruptcy. 
Another consultant bought stock in Reliant Energy of Houston, a large power 
plant operator that bought several California plants from utilities after 
deregulation. 
Bernard Barretto, an energy trader, who buys energy on the daily spot market, 
said in an interview that he bought about $2,000 in Enron stock shortly 
before he began work for the state Feb. 28. 
Purchase of Enron Stock Defended 
""I don't see a conflict,"" he said. ""At the time, we weren't really dealing 
with Enron. I [still] haven't bought from Enron."" 
Barretto said he never considered his Enron ownership a possible conflict 
until he received notice July 18 that he had to sell the stocks by noon or 
lose his job. 
That notice came from Goode, the governor's lawyer. 
""We expect and have always expected the state's consultants to uphold the 
highest ethical standards,"" he wrote. ""That standard is not met by those who 
hold a financial interest in one or more energy companies while trading on 
behalf of the state on energy related matters."" 
""Therefore each consultant who holds an interest in an energy company must 
divest himself or herself of that interest by noon today. If he or she 
refuses, the state will sever its contract with that person."" 
However, the governor's office has taken a distinctly different stance with 
his closest financial advisors, Fichera and Hoffman. 
Davis aides cite an opinion sought last week from attorney Raquelle de la 
Rocha, a former member of the Los Angeles Ethics Commission and the state 
Fair Political Practices Commission. She concluded that the advisors do not 
have to file disclosure statements because they are contractors, not 
consultants, and will be working for less than a year on a limited range of 
projects. 
Fichera is Davis' point man on the governor's energy rescue plan--including 
the unprecedented bond sale. He has pitched the plan to lawmakers, reporters 
and the Wall Street financial community. Fichera refused to comment on the 
record. 
Fichera and Hoffman's companies, Saber Partners and Blackstone Group, 
prepared a controversial analysis that helped underpin legislative approval 
of the bond measure, intended to pay for past and future power buying. 
Pact Specifies Financial Advice 
The state's contract with the Fichera and Hoffman firms calls for them to 
provide ""financial advisory services"" to the state. 
The decision not to require public disclosure of their financial holdings 
stands in sharp contrast to the approach taken with Montague DeRose and 
Associates. That consulting firm was hired on a $1.8-million contract. Like 
the other two firms, it too was hired to provide ""financial advisory 
services"" to the state. 
That firm's top advisor, Douglas S. Montague, was required by the 
administration to fill out a disclosure statement. He reported no power 
company interests. 
The governor's legal advisors said the difference is that Montague is on a 
longer contract.

Probably no need to reiterate here (it just makes me feel better), but the =
date of the bill signing or September 1 is MUCH MUCH preferable to EES. We =
have substantial contracts that we executed at the end of August.

?=09On Friday, the Assembly failed to get its version of the Edison MOU out=
 of the appropriations committee.
?=09The bill must pass out of that committee before it can go to the full A=
ssembly for passage.
?=09Negotiations continue among Assembly Democrats about what the final bil=
l should look like.
?=09The Assembly will try again to pass the bill out of the Assembly on Tue=
sday.
?=09In response to the California PUC proposed order, which would retroacti=
vely end Direct Access on July 1, the Assembly amended its bill on Friday t=
o include its own ""date certain"" for the temporary suspension of Direct Acc=
ess.
?=09The Assembly bill would now suspend Direct Access beginning August 25.
?=09We are working with others to get the date of suspension changed to eit=
her 1) the date the bill is signed or 2) September 1.
?=09We will provide additional information on Tuesday about the bill's stat=
us and our progress in changing the suspension date.

Best,
Jeff

?=09The Assembly will attempt to pass its version of the Edison MOU (SB 78)=
 out of the Appropriations Committee today.
?=09If and when that occurs, the Assembly will also attempt to get the bill=
 passed out of the full Assembly today.
?=09It will be a very long putt to get both accomplished today.
?=09If and when the Assembly gets the bill out of the Assembly today, the b=
ill will move over to the Senate, where the chances of passage are even mor=
e remote.
?=09That said, Davis is making a full court press to get the bill passed ou=
t of both houses for his signature.
?=09Will report back with the events of the Assembly.

Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions (415.782.7822).

Best,
Jeff
