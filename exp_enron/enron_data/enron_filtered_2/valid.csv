"Rick,

I want to bring  Aram Sogomonian back to Enron at s VP level.
According to new human resources procedures this decision requires
a support of three senior executives.

I want to ask you to express your opinion on Aram (based on a phone interview
or just on your past interactions with him). You can send a reply to Norma 
Villarreal at H/R.

Thanks.

"Barbara,
 This relates to our meeting last Thursday when I asked Brenda if the Entex 
Gas Marketing transactions stayed with Janet Wallis.  It is my understanding 
that the Entex traders for both Entex and Entex Gas Marketing are sometimes 
the same.  I recall times when Janet would request a deal under Entex and 
then Entex would move the  transaction to Entex Gas Marketing.  They have 
also gone the other way on some deals.  
 The same is possible with Southern Union Gas Company and Mercado in 
Galveston and Port Arthur.  
 I raised the question because these may occur at or behind the city gate 
delivery point.
Brenda said that she was going to ask the business group how they wanted to 
handle Entex Gas Marketing and Mercado.

Subject:	Potential rotation in west gas trading discussed with Mike Roberts

Vince,

We are searching for an individual to join the west gas trading desk on a temporary basis to lead the development of a comprehensive energy demand model.  Mike Roberts suggested that a member from your research team might be a good fit.

Our vision is to develop a consumption model for the western states (WSCC) which merges factors from natural gas and electricity markets.  This model would consider but may not be limited to: weather, electricity loads, a generation stack and commodity prices (hyrdo, coal, nuclear, oil, etc...), electricity transmission across regions, and predictable non-economic behavior patterns.  This individual would receive extensive exposure to our commercial environment and would have significant support from team members on our desk.

Two members of our team have started this project and I am very excited by the scope and depth that can be achieved with your help.  Please let me know if you are interested.

Sincerely,
Keith Holst"

"I'm working on the Merrill/Belco assignment of trades with, I guess, Sara.  
Mark Taylor signed off yesterday on the assignment that appears to again have 
been executed by Fred without Legal's initials.  It appears the date Fred 
signed it is about the time Mark Taylor talked to him about not signing 
contractual documents without Legal's initials.

There appears to be two differences in the redone confirms Merrill sent us:  
(1)  they added a Fallback Reference Price, and (2) they have changed the 
settlement and/or payment dates in the confirms.

Bernice said Sara signed off on a similar Fallback Reference Price in some 
confirms she had previously done with Merrill, so I briefly discussed this 
with Sara before she had to leave for lunch.  We'll look at it some more 
after lunch.

On the change in the settlement/payment dates, I told Bernice they were 
changing the deal and she needed the business guy on the transactions to sign 
off on that change.  She was going to take the confirms to Fred and get him 
to sign off that that is what he's agreed to.

Now, if Sara doesn't know anything about the additional Fallback Reference 
Price, we'll obviously have to take that back to the dealmaker to sign off on 
too.

Are you also working on this?

So that's what's going on..."

Rod:
Here are their credit issues:

1. In the cross-default language that want to add language that basically 
says that even if a cross-default occurs, unless the Non-Defaulting 
determines in good faith that performance by the Defaulting Party of its 
obligations under the Master is ""endangered"", then no cross default is 
triggered.

2. In Credit Event Upon Merger we had commented that instaed of the 
""materially weaker"" standard we wanted to specify that it meant being rated 
below BBB- by S&P.  Do you feel strongly about this?  Alos, we usually have 
language that says that if an event like merger occurs and the transferee 
provides collateral to the other party in an amount that is satisfactory to 
such party, then a Credit Event Upon Merger is not triggered.  They did not 
want to add this carve-out.  Are you okay with this?

3. They want a separate Event of Default that gets triggered if a MAC (below 
BBB-) occurs.  We requested that it be out in the collateral threshold 
language.

4. They are saying that for ""operational"" purposes, they cannot agree to 
""netting"".

5. They want as a category of Eligible Collateral governmental securities 
with a maturity of less than 1 year, valued at 98%.

6. In the CSA, if a dispute occurs with respect to either the calculation of 
Exposure or the calculation of the value of any colateral in connection with 
a party's request either for the transfer or return of collateral, normally 
the following procedures apply:

a. the disputing party notifies the other party of the nature of the dispute 
by the close of business on the day following the day that the collateral 
request was made.

b. the undisputed amount is transferred to the party making the request

c. the parties attempt to resolve the dispute by the ""Resolution Time"" and if 
a resolution is not reached, a recalculation of the Exposure is made and 
market quotations have to be obtained.

We normally say that the Resolution Time is 3 Business Days after the dispute 
notice is given.  DB wants to shorten this period to 1 Business Day after the 
dispute notice is given which gives the parties less time to resolve the 
dispute on their own.  What do you think?

7. If a party holds cash as collateral, we normally say that interest earned 
is transferred on the first day of the month.  They want to change first to 
last.

Let me know what you think.  I was hoping that some of these you could 
resolve with your counterpart at DB.

		 Subject: one-unit courses for Fall 2001

Hi,

ONE-UNIT COURSES:
The demand for one-unit courses is very high, as outlined in the Student 
Handbook.  It is uncommon for a student to be given a space in more than 
ONE one-unit course per semester.

If you got into your 1st choice of a 1-unit class for Fall 2001, you will 
not be put on a waitlist for your 2nd choice at this time.  After classes 
start in the Fall, if there is room available in any of the 1-units, we'll 
let you know.  Adds will be based on seniority in the program.

Thanks!
You'll be given a chance to update your schedules May 4 - May 11.
I will e-mail your Fall 2001 schedules to you this Friday.

Thanks!
TJ

Attached are the documents Mike and I discussed.

1) Fact Sheet provided by TVA
2) Draft Master Purchase Agreement between Valley Energy and your company
3) Sample Confirmation Letter for Transactions under the Agreement

Valley Energy Corporation will be acting as purchase agent for an
aggregated group of TVA power distributors totaling about 400 MW.  We will
be purchasing blocks of 5 x 16 liquidated damages firm energy each week.
The minimum block size will be 25 MW delivered to the TVA control area.

The Draft Master Purchase Agreement reflects the requirements and
constraints placed on us as a participant in the TVA program.

Valley energy is in the process of obtaining a Line of Credit to satisfy
the credit requirements of our supplier counterparties.  We are also
interested in similar protection for situations where liquidated damages
may be due from our suppliers.

Please review the attached documents and provide me with feedback as soon
as possible.

Our objective is to be able to conduct business by April 6, 2000, which is
the first day TVA will allow us to participate.  Power purchased on April 6
would be for delivery beginning April 10, 2000.

Call if you have questions.

Thank you very much,

"Carolyn:

I wanted to apologize for the way the group dynamic has shaped up.  It's 
clear to me that you're a bit frustrated, and if I've contributed, I 
apologize.  

You've done the most work on this project, your contribution has been very 
significant, and I personally am not satisfied about the way that the stuff 
you've pulled together (and your views) have been included.  At some point, 
though, it gets tough beating one's head against the wall.  Seems to me that, 
in a group, everyone should have some of their views included---that's what 
groups and compromises are all about.  After all, it's school.  We've made a 
lot of sacrifices to do it, and the point is to learn.

Anyway, I hope you'll still comment on the presentation, and I'm glad that 
you've agreed to do part of it on Thursday.  For my part, I felt that I 
pushed yesterday about as much as I'm prepared to push and at this point, 
I'll put the ratios tables together, offer a few edits, buy don' t see much 
use going to the mat.

Overall, I think it'll be an okay presentation, though getting there has 
been, well, bumpy.

But thanks very much for all the work you did.  It was important, and the 
presentation is better off for it.

Best,

Mr. Rogers,
Just to quickly address your questions in advance of our call in the
morning, I offer the following:

1.  The debt amount contemplated was based on assumptions given by Enron.
The rate given was $375 /kW or $120MM in debt.  This would be obtained via
a 144A Bond offering without any subdebt.

2.  There are three operating fees listed in the proforma currently:
Management fee ($600k/yr) to the Owners as contracted, O&M Fee ($300k/yr)
to the Operator contemplated to be TECO Power Services (""TPS"") and the TPS
Parts Company for a spare engine.  The TPS Spare engine may be eliminated
provided we can get comfort via other methods.  The financing fees were
estimates based on discussions with Enron and our engaging CSFB.

3.  The Maintenance Reserve account is accrued based on operating hours of
the plant and planned major maintenance, as estimated by TPS (the O&M
Operator).  This reserve may be eliminated as we currently are estimating
that this plant will never reach a major outage.

I look forward to discussing these issues with you in the morning.

Regards,
Patrick Smith

include separation, regulation or site with fencing which Tejas is expecting

To proceed, the field people need to meet and agree upon the details, and a

cost incurred for
 the meter installation is reimbursable to Tejas.

Jeff:

I just got done ready your memo.  I really liked what you have done.  I did 
not want to make any direct changes, but rather just pose a few questions 
for discussion.

First, when I calculated how long it would take to purchase the shares 
without debt I did use the net income number.  It might be better to change 
them to the operating cash flow number.  If you guys would like, I can 
recalculate them.

I agree that having higher amounts of debt will fend off take overs.

Are we planing to calculate the amount the tax shield will increase the 
value of the company.  If we assume that the debt will be held in 
perpetuity, we can directly compute the amount.  Let me know and I can run 
the numbers.

Also, Jimmy when you do the color graphs you want to do.  Try some MM pie 
charts (just kidding)

Good job,

Let me know what I can do to help.

2.  What is the status of the GE breakout contract for the LV units?  Panda 
has asked (twice) for this and I would like to give them a timeline for its 
delivery.  We will need a day or two to redact the sensitive commercial data 
before delivery to Panda.

3.  I will call Panda this morning and float the $250K exclusivity fee 
concept.

4. Will the draft Letter Agreement be available today?  I have told Panda 
that this document would come first with the Facility Agreement and LLC 
Agreement to follow.

5. Stephen Thome is scheduled to be in Houston this afternoon.  I will bring 
him up to speed.

Let me know on 1,2, and 4 above.

Thanks,
Fred

"Would it work if we picked you up in the USVI?  I know it's possible to fly 
into St. Thomas either directly from New York or through San Juan and you 
could take a ferry to St. John (still part o the USVI) where we could pick 
you up.  It's a bit of a hassle since we have to clear the boat into the US 
and then back to the BVI but I've done it a couple of times before.  The 
timing might be difficult since we can't possibly get the boat to St. John 
before the afternoon of the 22nd.  If you're nervous about sailing into the 
BVI, we could stick around St. John for a few days.  You might check the 
cruising guide & see what it says about the US side of things - places to 
go/anchor, etc."

Cyrus/Julie,

Can you please coordinate with Jamie White at ITG on this install.  I don't 
really care how I get it.  I would presume that someone in our IT group 
worked with ITG to determine the best delivery method on the original 
install.  If so, please use the same architecture.  If not, please consider 
the options and if we think there exists a better method than the one being 
in Houston, let's upgrade the one in Houston concurrently with the London 
install so the two sites are in synch.

This install will initially be for European equity trading only but we may 
want to incorporate US equities at a later date as well.  Any activity on 
this setup will be governed by the same agreements currently in place as it 
will be done on behalf of both ECT Investments and Enron North America until 
further notice.

Thanks and regards,
John

Project is Eletrobolt.   ESA has had GE send the stacks for the Electrobolt

are a couple other changes.

I need to prepare an amendment cover those changes as well a capture the in

signed out a letter prepared by Kay addressing an agreement related to

I would be very helpful if I could have a copy of the letter so I understand

Per my voice mail here is what credit wants to explore.  If we have an ISDA 
in place with a non-regulated affiliate of a utility, they want to create 
some credit triggers that would be based on events that occur with respect to 
our counterparty's regulated utility affiliate.  Can this be done?  Could we, 
for example, have a drop in the credit rating of the utility trigger a MAC?  
Could we cross default to the utility's physical and/or financial 
transactions?  I know that there are limitations on what can be done, I just 
didn't know how extensive they were.

		 Subject: Edison's SO2 credits

Edison filed A.00-05-027, its applications to divest its remaining SO2
credits, on May 15, 2000.  ORA protested on June 30, and Edison and ORA
worked out their differences and filed a joint recommendation on October 2.
According to the joint recommendation, which I will fax over to you,
Edison's original proposal was to auction off its SO2 credits.  The joint
recommendation accepts the auction approach, except that if no bids are
received for some credits, then those credits will be retained within the
regulated utility, and any future net proceeds will be credited to
ratepayers.  It appears that Edison's original proposal would have
transferred such no-bid credits to an unregulated affiliate at zero cost.
The joint recommendation also states that any no-bid credits retained by the
regulated utility will be deemed to have been market valued, and will have a
zero market value for purposes of determining transition costs.
No Commission decision has been issued on this matter.  No decision in this
matter appears on the Commission's agenda for March 15.  I can follow up on
the status and likely date of decision if you like.
Other than the joint recommendation I am about to fax to you, the only other
documents filed in this case were Edison's application and ORA's protest.
Please let me know if you would like a copy of either of them.

"Use the ""Daily Activity"" worksheet in this file.  The CES storage balance as 
of 7/31/2000 is 4,053,932 dth (see balance in cell L146).  The actual sale to 
CES for the storage injections is deal 268094 - this deal shows the daily and 
monthly activity.

If I remember correctly, the only confusion we had on the TCO storage was the 
beginning balance.  There was 170,981 dth in storage on March 31st.  To 
correct for this, we adjusted the injections for April so that the balance on 
April 30th was 13%.

Let me know if you have questions.

Subject: Storage on TCO - PLEASE READ

To ensure everyone is on the same page.... Steve Stonestreet at TCO and I had 
a conversation on how TCO works its storage ratchets. Steve, if I have 
misstated something, please let us know.

There is a FSS schedule that tells the ratchets, minimum injections, maximum 
withdrawals, etc. This FSS schedule has been updated in the attached 
spreadsheet with Enron's SCQ and Enron's MDSQ, which enables Enron to know 
its different volume requirements.

Based on the attached schedule, each month there are different Maximum 
Monthly Injection Quantities (MMIQ)  based on Enron's SCQ. There is no 
Minimum Injection Quantity required by TCO.

TCO Injection Session and % of SCQ;

April = 15%
May = 20%
June = 20%
July = 20%
Aug = 20%
Sept = 13%
Oct = 7 %

If you add these months up, the total Injection is 115%. Essentially, 
shippers have an extra 15% that does not have to be used during the injection 
period. Please note, Shippers can inject all year around on TCO (November is 
5% and December through March is 10%... typically not done).

For example, Shippers do not have to inject the ratchet amount in April 
(15%). If the Shipper falls behind on the STOI, and the Shipper needs to 
catch up on STOI in the future months, and the Shipper wants to go over the 
ratchet level for that month, then TCO will need to give its prior approval 
(I sound like a lawyer). Typically, TCO is more willing to approve 
overinjections in the early months of the injection session versus 
overinjecting in September and October, when TCO is full. 


Some other basic rules;

Shippers do not have to fill storage 100% by October.

Shippers cannot have more than  60% in storage by June 1st, unless 
overinjection is approved by TCO.

Shippers can have daily net withdrawals in the summer, and it works the same 
way it did in the Winter. Depending on the % SCQ, this will determine the 
MDWQ. As of today, 8.3% is in the ground so Enron can net withdraw 54,324. 
Once Enron is between 10% to 20%, then the MDWQ is 70,521... but remember 
Enron's SST is only 54,324 until October 1st... so other transport will need 
to be used to avoid overrun charges.


Why do we care about all of this....

Enron wants to slow down on the injection into storage. Because choice still 
uses storage withdrawal in April and storage withdrawal is used for 
Hopewell... there may be days that we are net withdrawing. As long as we stay 
below 54,324... there will not be penalties. If we go over this amount, we 
will need to get gas controls approval... the same drill we use for 
overinjections above 36,304.

TCO Schedulers... we have been doing a great job monitoring this so far. 
April is a very hard month to monitor storage. Remember, if we have problems 
running Storage reports from our PC's or Laptops, TCO has the ability to run 
the reports and TCO will run it on the weekends if necessary. From these 
reports, we can determine if we need to get the overwithdrawal or 
overinjection approval from TCO's Gas Control. TCO's gas control will need a 
volume amount to place in their book... which is the bible for TCO enforcing  
penalties. The penalties are pretty steep... max is $10 dkt.

Please save this note for future reference.

"Actually, we should be nominating only 4,000 month from Power Gas and 300 day 
from Phillips Production.  That works out to about 429 day.  

I just spoke to Samson and he agrees the volume for July should only be 4,000 
for the month.  

AND Angie (my super fantastic, can't say enough good things about her, will 
probably be my boss someday and sometimes acts like it,  CNG scheduler) has 
agreed to help out any way she can.  She knows escript pretty well.  Chat 
with Doug, if you guys agree, Angie can use your ID and password and figure 
out how to run all the reports we need back to January.  Also, we will not 
know the actuals for July production until September sometime.

Effective August 1st, the Phillip's wells should be transferred to Clinton's 
brand new pool and Clinton will also nominate the Power Gas pool gas. 

Doug, John Singer said he does not have any production reports from Heidi.  
With Angie's help, we could probably clear up the CNG LDC activity fairly 
easy.

Let me know what you guys think.

Subject: PNG Local Production July 00


Hi Paul and Chris,
 Our friend Sampson at Power Gas still maintains that their local
production behind PNG has not been nominated for July yet, which was 7500
dth/month.  Did you guys do a deal for this gas too?  He usually nominates it
all on one day, so Clinton/CES needs to coordinate with him what day to do it
on (right now the gas is out there on his side on the 17th).  I know Heidi
nominated the Phillips gas baseloaded thru the month at 443/day, but I was not
sure about the Power, until I checked and sure enough the nom isn't out there
yet.
 I can get help nominating it from PNG to get it through CES' pool but I
want to make sure that's what we need to do.  Just give me the word and I will
call Sampson to get it done, but I will make it clear to him that this is the
last month he'll need to talk to me about it.  Thank you very much for the
clarifications!

Jeff - I know we are a bit tardy in getting back to you. I think a good place to start would be a close review and routine updates on the following:

1. PGT Gas Accord vs. attempt to convert jurisdiction to FERC in bankruptcy proceeding. As discussed, any delay in PG&E's ability to deal with the generators on a long term basis will facilitate bypass projects into the state.

2. Socal - resurrection of GIR or any plans to open the backbone to firm, path based transportation.

3. Southern Trails battle with Socal to gain access to firm takeaway capacity on SoCal's system and developments in Socal's RLS tariff.

4. Any issues that you believe affect our commercial efforts in California.

Obviously this is a small list. I would appreciate your feedback on issues that you believe to be critical drivers.

Regards,

Stephanie

Stephanie and I met with Jeff Dasovich in San Fransisco on Friday.  Jeff understands that he can play an important/strategic role in assisting ENA West Gas in understanding the regulated issues for Gas... There is no doubt that ENA has spent most of our resources in power ( and for good reason) however we need to re focus energy on gas related structures. 

To facilitate this effort, Jeff has offered to focus some more of his time and effort on coordinating some of the key commercial issues related to California.  Jane and Stephanie need to create a priority list that represents West Gas issues and ""Hot Button"" or action items. Once created we can work with Jeff on action items.  In addition to this immediate need, Jeff will join our conference call's/meetings ( or attend where possible).  The next session I have on my calendar is Thurs Sept 5 @ 2:30.  

I trust this initiative will further enhance an already effective procedure. If there are any questions, let me know.

It is not clear to me what precipitated this most inquiry from Anadarko or

Assuming that you are not anxious for this task, I propose that I tell them
that, because you are currently tied up on other matters, I will be the
temporary representative on the committee and that after the holidays we
will be back in touch further.

Such a response would parry this somewhat odd inquiry / statement, and will
allow us to reassess the situation when Andy gets on board and gets his feet

Hertzberg (speaker of the CA Assembly) called a meeting yesterday afternoon 
of the group of market participants that have been negotiating the 
""core/noncore"" proposal in California.  The purpose of the meeting was to 
brief us on their activities and their gameplan for trying to find a solution 
for California.  Here's a summary of the meeting.  Please keep confidential.

Work will be done over the weekend to put the core/noncore proposal in 
legislative language.  (We will be in the room.)
Work done by the ""Plan B"" group in the Assembly (Joe Dutra and Joe Nation) 
will also be put into legislative language over the weekend.
Because no proposal is ""comprehensive,"" a complete legislative package will 
be created from the various pieces that have been worked on thus far (i.e., 
core/noncore, ""Plan B,"" Edison MOU)
In addition, there are Republican demands that Hertzberg will need to address 
(e.g., end the litigation) in order to achieve bi-partison support, which is 
what Hertzberg's shooting for. 
To move the legislation, the plan is to establish a ""conference committee,"" 
comprised of an equal number of Democrats and Republicans.
The committe would begin work on Monday and would attempt to finish putting a 
comprehensive bill together, vote it out of the Legislature and send it to 
the Governor for signing by Monday, July 16th.
July 16th is the deadline because that is the date that the PUC will issue 
its proposed decision regarding, among other things, how DWR's revenue 
requirement will be put into rates, whether Direct Access needs to be 
suspended, etc.
The PUC is issuing the draft on the 16th in order to give everyone 30 days to 
review and comment before the Commission votes on a final order on August 
15th.  (The PUC will actually issue a ""thought piece"" on Monday the 9th and 
will use reactions to the ""thought piece"" to craft the develop the proposed 
decision it plans to issue on the 16th.)
All of this is still up in the air, however.  As of right now, the leader of 
the Senate (Burton) has not agreed to Hertzberg's gameplan and the 
Republicans, while interested, have not yet committed to join the process.

"I spoke with Phil Harris today.

My key messages -

1. Commercial interest does not appear high on partnering / investing with 
PJM Technologies right now.  Doesn't mean that this is forever, but probably 
will want to gauge the markets reaction to your activities before .

2. We've drafted a Stipulation for Enron and PJM that gets most of Enron on 
board that I'm happy to send to your lawyers, but I want to be realistic 
about its chances of success -  

a)  appointment of a Settlement Judge (not Technical Staff) to oversee the 
consolidation process with quarterly updates and right to comment from all 
parties;
b) PJM will agree to modify its system including 1) FTR system, 2) eliminate 
ICAP obligation, and 3) discussion about central market making functions (day 
ahead markets).
c) a more specific obligation to move forward with the ability for Enron file 
at FERC on Nov.1.02 to repeal this status with PJM pre-approval on our filing 
(I went beyond the agreeing not to oppose such a filing).

He agreed with me that PJM wouldn't be able to sign.  We talked a little 
about a middle ground, but he and I did not see any real options.  

Given the time commitments for his lawyers, he is going to file something 
that would (a) agree to a Settlement Judge, (b) ask FERC not to predetermine 
any outcomes, especially a merger, and (c) don't hold his RTO hostage to our 
demands.

I think that given the Alliance RTO and GridSouth RTO language, he'll get his 
Order.

We agreed to keep talking.  I told him that we are trying to enter into 
discussions with the PA PUC about moving their market further ahead and I'd 
keep him in the loop.

He told me that he would be on C-SPAN this Wed am to discuss competition.  He 
really is a big believer in this market.

Finally, and most interestingly, he did not oppose the idea of minimizing the 
central market making functions of PJM.  He does not have a philosophy that 
the Sys Op must manage all of the markets (I specifically asked about Day 
Ahead).  He does see  a need for a workable solution that can shore up public 
confidence right now.  He would like to migrate to a more market driven 
environment in a reasonable timeframe.  He fully agrees that the market is 
better than a Sys Op in determining what happens - his limitations are 
technology and systems.  Ultimately the Sys Op should do nothing more than 
manage the network within the last 10 minute interval."

Subject:	Angelides Oct. 19th Letter to L. Lynch Urging July 1 DA Suspension Date

I'm sure that by now everyone's seen the letter that Angelides sent to Loretta last Friday.  If you haven't, let me know and I'll have it faxed to you.  In short, Angelides blames all of the financial woes of the State on Loretta and the PUC.  Specifically, he claims that by allowing DA sign-ups to extend to September 20th, the PUC may have shifted over $8 billion to ""homeowners, small businesses, and other enterprises...""  Angelides ends the lettery by urging the Commission to immediately roll back the DA suspension date to July 1.

The concern, of course, is that Angelides' assertions are out there and have received alot of press attention, i.e., Direct Access=$8 billion tax on homeowners.  

To her credit, Loretta refuted Angelides in the press accounts and repeated that the best way to get costs down is to renegotiate the DWR contracts.  She also said in the press accounts that she intends to deal with the July 1/September 20 suspension issue at the next commission meeting.

In light of these events (and the increasing attacks on Loretta by Angelides and others in the Administration) It might be useful to give Loretta an assist by drafting a very brief letter to her stating:

Angelides is all wet--DA and ""fairness"" are not mutually exclusive and the PUC has all the regulatory tools necessary to ensure fairness is maintained going forward.  Thus, the 8 plus billion dollar number is without basis.
Re-stating that the PUC has no legal authority to retroactively suspend DA to July 1, etc., etc.

Folks may have other points to make.  Seems that we'd want to keep the letter short and to the point, however.  

A letter might be useful in order to 1) give Loretta some support and 2) get some counter-press in response to the Angelides tantrum.

Any thoughts?  

Best,
Jeff

Gephardt has already declined.  Once we know their status, we may want to 
consider inviting key members of the Bush Cabinet.  We may want to also 
explore the availability of key Committee Chairs.  Phil also noted that we 
should consider having the President-elect during the evening program of Feb.

2. Is volatility the right tool for energy markets?

3. The dynamics of energy prices in the US markets in recent years: a few stylized facts

"Molly,

Thanks for the update. Two points.

Please, let Neil McGregor know that many possible proposals were floated
with regard to Anshuman and there was some noise in the system.
We need L1 visa anyway and we decided to go ahead an arrange it.
I shall also write to him and explain the confusion.

Also, if I have the choice between upsetting Neil or Jeffs (Shankman and 
Skilling),
I shall choose Neil.

Houston for one month, and you had mentioned six months when we spoke

"Greetings Colleen:
I'm not sure who's still working on this and who's not, but sometime back, we did a very extensive effort with Tim Hamilton and the rest of the EES team to get all information compiled regarding OFOs behind PG&E and SoCalGas.  I'm hoping that that information still exists so we can hopefully avoid recreating the wheel.  If, for some reason, the information is lost, the good news is that all OFO tariffs are compiled and easily retrievable on the SoCalGas' and PG&E's websites.  Please let me know how else we can help.

Best,
Jeff

Leslie -- Funny you should ask.  Columbia of Ohio called 51 OFO/OMO days last winter.  Other Columbia companies ( C of Penn., C of VA) did likewise.  Attached is a confidential draft complaint from our attorney in Ohio that I believe provides the info you seek.  Also attached is the Complaint filed by Hess,et al in Pennsylvania against Columbia there.  The facts and allegations are essentially the same:  confiscation/interruption of banked gas during OFO; OFO called for economic, not operational  reasons; heavy penalties for failure to deliver full MDQ; etc. 
My recollection is that Peoples and NorthShore called few, if any OFOs last winter.  Ditto for Nicor. I have a call in to those that know first hand about these latter three utilities so I'll forward that answer as soon as I receive it.
Please call if you have any questions or if can be of further assistance.

Last week I asked you about OFOs and you requested a list of the LDCs we are most interested in.  At this time (and in this order), I need any information you can give us on OFO history (frequency, actual dates, reason for OFO--system long or short?, etc.) on the following LDCs:

	PG&E, Socal	
	NIGAS, Peoples (Chicago), Northshore
	Columbia of Ohio

This is a good starting point for now.  Just so you know, we need this data as we are trying to verify/set/modify (whatever you want to call it), the price curves being set by the traders reflecting LDC risk.  Obviously, the frequency of OFOs will affect our risk of doing business on a particular LDC, so we need to try to compare and access charges associated with each.  Any help or direction you can provide on where to get this data would be most appreciated.

"Sue:
Sorry that I didn't get back to you over the weekend but with Arthur's 
baseball schedule and all the running around that we were trying to do, 
things were a bit hectic.  I'm officially brain dead today so I thought that 
I would take a break and write to one of my favorite people.

Things on the baby front are progressing well.  On our last ultrasound we got 
the news taht we were hoping for with respect to the placenta problem and so 
I've got the green light basically to do whatever I want to do although I am 
still taking it easy and swimming alot.  The baby weighed about 4 pounds a 
few weeks ago and everything looked great so I was quite relieved.  Now I'm 
trying to spend what little free time I have getting ready.  the people here 
at work are having a baby shower a week from Friday so hopefully that will 
help since other than some of Arthur's clothes I am starting from scratch.  
Work is going well although I am looking forward to winding down in a few 
weeks.  I'm hoping that I can work up until the very end to maximize my time 
off but we will see how that goes.  I really feel great except for being 
uncomfortable at night and not getting much sleep but i suppose that this is 
good practice for when the baby comes.

Arthur is doing great.  We got him 2 gerbils as a substitute for a larger 
pet!  They're pretty cute, small, clean and so far easy to maintain.  He is 
still heavily into baseball and was just selected for the All-star team which 
we were absolutely thrilled about as was he!  He called dad practically every 
day that he was trying out for the team to give him an update and I'm hoping 
that dad can fly down for the tournament this weekend.  Arthur would  be on 
cloud nine if he came.  We'll see.  Mom and dad offerred to keep Arthur for a 
week over the summer and we are looking into that.  I'm toying with the 
possibility of sending him when the baby is born, but  I'll just have to see 
how it works out.  I would really love for you and mom to come once the baby 
is born.  Do you have any thoughts on that?  You are obvious;y welcome at any 
time, but i sense from mom taht she would prefer to wait until sometime in 
august.  Let me know what you think.

How is Cindy doing?  Do you know what she needs for her new addition?  Do you 
want to get her a joint gift?  Let me know.  I'm happy to do either something 
on my own or jointly with you.  How's Cate?  Give her my best.

What's new with you and your career situation?  I hope that you are enjoying 
what you are doing.  I certainly am and  I am still undecided about what I am 
going to do once that baby is born, although I would really like to take the 
rest of the year off.

I've got to run to my ""baby class"" tonight.  Take care and I will try to 
catch up with you sometime.  I love you!

Carol"

Sara, RMT/NNG was put on hold per Tony Pryor's request pending restructuring 
of NNG.  This restructuring is finished (it involved NNG going from 100% 
Enron-owned to about 98%).  I talked with Tony yesterday on this and he says 
the ISDA may now proceed. Tax has confirmed this is still an RMT deal.

Re the fx trade you mentioned, the confirm desk has drafted a deemed ISDA for 
this that needs fixing. (not sure what they are doing drafting deemed 
ISDAs).  I am working with Melissa Rodriguez on this.  

I do have a voice mail in to Tanya to ask her if credit wants to re-review in 
light of the new NNG ownership structure.  Even though the ownership change 
seems minor, it seems like the procedurally sound thing to do is to run this 
by credit.  Have not heard back from Tanya and will bring this up at 
legal/credit meeting this afternoon.

I will take this over, including the ISDA master.  Susan, in the meantime, 
could you e-mail me the credit review sheet on this if you have one. -- Bob

Subject: Salmon Energy Post-Closing Risks Justifying Guaranty

Steve, per our phone conversation, the following are examples of post-closing 
risks that justify Delta's provision of a Parent Guaranty:

- Delta Affiliate issues a $5 million Change Order to GE, but doesn't have 
the money to pay for it; Enron decides to pay for that change order in order 
to maintain our relationship with GE and then Enron's recourse is limited to 
the Delta Affiliate that defaulted on the GE Change Order payment in the 
first place

- Delta Affiliate stops paying for the Insurance that the LLC must have; 
Enron decides to make the Insurance payments and then must recover the costs 
from the Delta Affiliate

- Despite its representations, Delta Affiliate has incurred a brokerage fee, 
defaults in that payment, Enron covers it and then must recover from Delta 
Affiliate

- Delta Affiliate incurs some third party personal injury liability and Enron 
becomes liable for it, and can seek recovery from the Delta Affiliate

- Delta Affiliate breaches the agreement and Enron seeks damages which are 
limited to what it can recover only from the Delta Affiliate

As a compromise, there could be a monetary cap on the guaranty that it be 
tied to the Transaction Value (ie $68 million)

I'm happy  to let everyone know that Cheryl Costa has joined our group as a
regular member. This is very timely for us, and she will be focusing on
finishing off the documentation for the Electro Bolt project as a priority
matter.

We have had to re-juggle the seating plan a little to accomodate this and
other changes, and the moves will occur this weekend.  Cheryl will be
moving into the office presently occupied by Bob Sevitz, who will be moving
into the space presently occupied by Mike Lewis.  Kristi Dobbs will be
moving into the space just outside of John Rigby's office presently
occupied by boxes. The Carlos Sole Memorial Office presently occupied by
his memory is reserved for the new attorney who will fill in for Carlos
(fill in only, of course, there can be no substitute).

I will be scheduling a meeting Friday, if not over lunch then in the early
afternoon to discuss a few minor developments with you guys and to get some
thoughts from you on the TurboPark and other off balance sheet models.

Well, here's a chance to take your mind off of things.  I've got a pair of exceptional 49er tickets--lowest section in 2nd tier, right on the 50 yardline. (My girlfriend's parents season tickets. I can't use them--in fact, ain't crazy about football)  They're playing the Saints, which will be a great game.  

I'm selling them for face value, which is $50 each.  Like to be able to give them to someone in the office if possible.  If you're interested, please let me know ASAP.

		 Subject: California Update 3/22/01

Executive Summary:

? The as yet unnumbered rescue bill by Davis made it to the Senate floor
? An exemption of the gas-fired QFs from this bill (as proposed by Sen. 
Keeley) could further forestall an involuntary bankruptcy filing.
? If passed, the draft CPUC order would give the utilities another 15 days 
after rate hikes to pay the QFs
? The negotiations with the QFs are complicated by the issue of payments owed 
by the utilities to the DWR. Senators are demanding that the utilities set up 
a trust fund from rate revenues to pay back the DWR. 
? The CalEnergy ruling (as reported by Bloomberg this PM) is an attractive 
option for other QFs looking to at least temporarily escape long-term supply 
contracts with Edison.
? If neither the CPUC nor the legislature exempts the gas-fired generators 
from the new rate structure, an immediate involuntary bankruptcy filing is 
expected.  However, if the exemption is implemented, then a bankruptcy filing 
would be delayed.

1. ""QF Bill"" Makes it to Senate Floor


The ""CPUC bill"" (the number is not yet known) is in mock-up form and does the 
following:

* Repeals PUC Code section 390, which set a formula for QFs under 
deregulation.
* Amends portions of AB 1X which will ensure that DWR receives money for its 
power purchases, and includes provisions for the issuance of bonds.
* Includes a provision for SDG&E rates since they were not covered under 
other legislation.

The bill passed the Senate Energy (8-2), and also just passed the Senate 
Appropriations Committee (8-2) and is headed to the Senate Floor.  


2. Senator Comments on the Bill:

Keeley (author of bill) presented that the bill would allow the PUC to decide 
the QF contracts which is the proper authority  to debate the issue.

Most of the opposition to this portion of the bill was regarding the fact 
that the bill provides no guidance to the PUC regarding voided costs for 
natural gas-fired QFs.  Republicans offered an amendment to not have section 
390 repealed for gas-fired generators, but Keeley had concerns with the 
amendment.  Keeley stated that he did not think they should limit the PUC's 
flexibility and that as drafted the amendment was too broad.  He also 
indicated that gas-fired utilities have a legitimate issue with the draft 
order.  He said that the PUC order needs to be amended, and Keeley is 
confident that the PUC has recognized that in discussion over the past 48 
hours.

3. Opponents to the QF Bill:


The following people testified in opposition to QF portion:  TURN, Delta 
Power (QF), Syke Energy, John Hancock Financial, California Manufacturers 
Association, Crockett Cogeneration, Independent Energy Producers, Clean Power 
Campaign, PG&E, SCE.

The gas-fired QFs that testified in opposition noted that they have been 
off-line for a couple of months and cannot come back on-line unless their 
issues are addressed.

In response to the QFs not getting paid, Sen. Bowen stated that if the 
utilities do not pay the QFs as directed under the draft order, then she 
would personally see to it that they go into bankruptcy.

4. PG&E and SCE Testimony:

Sen. Battin asked both utilities about the draft order, which states that 
after the change in the rates by QFs the utilities must pay the QFs within 15 
days, and whether the utilities would abide by the order.

PG&E's response was that they are receiving $400 million per month, the cost 
of their own generation is $100 million, and the QF amount is $240 million 
per month; the draft order would lower the QF cost to $140 million.   PG&E 
was cut off at this point and asked point blank whether their answer to 
Battin's question was ""yes or no.""  Battin, Bowen and Murray all asked
whether it was yes or no.  The PG&E rep stated that it would be ""no"" if the 
issue of the payments owed to ISO and DWR is not resolved.  If the ISO costs 
of purchases were included in the DWR payments, then PG&E would not have a 
problem.

The SCE response was that if the money coming in was less than the money 
going out, then it could not comply with the PUC order.

5.  Payments to DWR

Senator Sher then asked both utilities regarding a requirement under AB 1X 
that the utilities set aside those moneys that are owed to the DWR for 
purchasing power that they collect from ratepayers in a trust fund those.  
SCE responded that they are still in negotiations with DWR on the terms and 
conditions.  Several legislators responded angrily that this was not part of 
the bill, and that they should have a trust fund set up.  PG&E noted that 
they are setting 'some' money aside, but would not state how much. Sen. Sher 
ended the conversation by stating that if the utilities do not set up a trust 
fund by tomorrow they would either pass emergency legislation or 'go after 
them' for violating the law.

1X Provisions:

Tim Gage from Dept. of Finance noted the Governor's support of the entire 
bill, and noted that the 1X provisions would ensure that DWR gets paid.

PG&E also testified in opposition to these provisions.

Senator Bowen made the following statements:

* Senator Peace has announced that he has received another notice of $500 
million appropriation needed to purchase power and will not approve the 
funding unless PG&E and SCE drop their challenge to the PUC regarding the DWR 
issue.
* Also stated that the PUC could always raise rates as a way to resolve the 
issue.

		 Subject: Change to standard ISDA Schedule

Dear All,

In the course of current ISDA Master Agreement negotiations with an 
Australian counterparty it has come to my attention that the ISDA netting 
opinion for Australia specifies that certain Sections of the ISDA Master 
should not be altered; otherwise reliance on the opinion, and close-out 
netting, could be jeopardised.  In particular the opinion specifies that 
Section 2(a)(iii) should not be altered.  

Enron has a standard alteration to Section 2(a)(iii) in Part 5 of its 
standard form Schedule, viz.  

""(a) Conditions Precedent.  The condition precedent set forth in clause (1) 
of Section 2(a)(iii) shall not apply to payments owed by a party if the other 
party shall have satisfied in full all its payment obligations under Section 
2(a)(i) and shall at the relevant time have no future payment obligations 
whether absolute or contingent, under Section 2(a)(i).""

Obviously, in the case of Australian counterparties this condition precedent 
should not be included in our documentation.

In addition, there are a number of other countries (including Germany, Italy, 
South Korea and Switzerland) where the effectiveness of the ISDA netting 
opinion presupposes that certain Sections of the Master, including Section 
2(a)(iii), are not altered in any material respect. To that end I would 
suggest that our standard condition precedent does make a material alteration 
and that it should not be included in ISDA Master Agreements with 
counterparties trading from these jurisdictions.

Certainly from the London end, I think that when we start negotiations with a 
new counterparty we should check the ISDA opinions to ensure that we don't 
trip ourselves up.

Regards, 

Edmund

Diann Huddleson has spoken with PG&E on numerous occasions, and they have

PG&E has changed the method of calculating the PX Credit recently.  Prior to 
June they appeared to be using a market based price for power, but in June 
the credit dropped to about $40/MWh which looks like utility-owned gen.

We want to make sure we are not missing a utility-levied charge in our 
forward curves ( e.g. CTC charge that will be applied to DA) so we're trying 
to verify the utilities' method of calculating PX credits.

I talked to the PG&E accounting person who said that their Regulatory group 
has sent Enron's regulatory group information on the way the PX Credit is 
calculated.  Can someone locate this information and forward it to me as soon 
as possible?  Given that our customers are all switching to DA we don't want 
to discover there's a charge we don't know about.

Thanks,
Tamara.

Subject: FW: Revised Lease Model


Current negotiations with AALLP has provided us "" a new look "" at the current 
lease model.  It has loosened up somewhat to our benefit.  AALLP has agreed 
to a ""two bucket"" approach as indicated on the attached matrix.  Note that we 
may operate under this model until the EITF provides definitive guidance 
which is expected in December 2001.  

We should now focus on the O&M aspect of an existing or development project.  

If we pass bucket one as it relates to O&M and offtake limits of 95% or less, 
we will not be in a lease and do not proceed to bucket 2.  Bucket two is 
essentially where we have been up to now.  

In a nutshell, if Enron does not operate, does not have the ability to hire 
and fire the operator (must have less than 50% voting on this), does not set 
or approve operating policies and procedures and takes 95% or less of the 
offtake, we should not be in a lease and we stop there.  If we supply the 
fuel and take 95% or less of the offtake and pass O&M criteria, the fuel 
supply agreement must have significant LD's.  See specifics for Bucket 1 on 
the attached.

NOTE:  Please keep us in the loop on new deals as we roll out this new 
model.  We still need to scrub the deals in order to keep AALLP informed.




Please distribute to those I have missed.

"I believe ENA is still agent for Columbia Energy Services and Columbia Energy 
Marketing on several pipelines.  Rich Contos's (the only CES person I know) 
last day is this Friday.  I left Rich a voicemail asking him if CES/CEM 
should continue to exist as a legal entity on the pipelines.

As ENA, I believe I sould at least begin terminating the agency (and

You're right about the secondary market.  The Commission imposes a 120%
limit on everyone.  The problem is, this is unenforceable.  Marketers will
just bundle transportation with commodity and inflate the commodity price to
extract the transportation premium.  This happened a few ago on the
interstates when FERC tried the same thing."

Republican Plan B
A source reports the following regarding the Republican Plan B proposal:
? Encourage direct access for consumers.  (The problem with this, however, is 
that these direct access deals would not have a dedicated rate component, and 
too many might undermine the cash flow and credit worthiness of the bonds.)
? The Republicans will ""suggest"" that generators take a 30% haircut.  ""We 
think this is doable.""
? The Republicans strongly oppose purchasing the transmission assets.
? Restore the invetor-owned utility model for generation.  They would 
establish a dedicated rate component for construction of native generation by 
the utilities.  They would grant ratepayers equity interest in these plants.
? Resolve the QFs' financial issues.

Assemblyman Cox commented afterward that the Republcans have been trying to 
work on a bilateral basis with the Democrats on these issues, but they feel 
""frozen out.""  Moreover, he senses the Democrats moving back toward having an 
option to purchase SoCal's transmission assets, which the Republicans oppose.

Democratic Plan B
A source reports the following regarding the Democratic Plan B:
? The Democrats are formulating a Plan B that incorporates the Governor's 
MOU, the Nation Plan B and other ideas that they have.  This plan reportedly 
has not yet been introduced into the legislature yet because it is still 
being finalized and the Democrats are not certain that it will work.  
Specifically, the option to purchase SoCal's transmission assets is 
reportedly still being debated.  Some Democrats reportedly believe that this 
may be unnecessary.
? The details of the plan are reportedly as follows:
- Set aside the $3.1 bilion undercollect in a separate account funded by a

their  claim or they can try to get up to 100% of their claim adjudicated 
through a  dispute.
- This plan could be used as a template for going to the bankruptcy judge to 
strike a deal  for PG&E.
? Sources indicate that the Democrats are developing a post-petition plan in 
cast SoCal files for bankruptcy, including the following:
- The state would buy both utilities out of bankruptcy.  It then would sell 
of pieces of  the utilities to various private-sector buyers, but with a 
lifetime stipulation on  how they will be run.
- Some Democrats reportedly believe the state could do this with as little as 
$5 billion if  it assumed the utilities' debt and got a cram-down by the 
bankrutpcy judge to quell  the protests against such a plan that would very 
likely erupt.  Democrats reportedly  believe that the Judge Montali would 
support this idea.

there is a chance that we will fly out tomorrow, spend tomorrow night in NY, 
then I can fly to Chicago Thursday am.  I still plan on flying back on

Also, I know we talked about several dates around early november, up to now
it seems like the 9th would be a candidate... If you could choose one (a

you could be free for a diner on the evening preceeding the presentations,
or on the day of the presentation I could set up a time table.

Hope all is going well.  I received your message about a meeting today,

be able to attend - I will be in  Thursday and Friday, so if there is 
anything I can do, just let me know.

"Cindy:
Thought I would try e-mailing you since using the phone is more of a 
challenge.  So far so good although I can't say that we are on any type of 
schedule.  Before I forget, what is the name of the breast pump that you are 
using?  Looks like the one that I have is not that great.  How many ounces 
should I expect to be able to pump?  I'm trying to judge whether I should 
keep this pump.  Anyway, back to Charles Eugene, he is pretty much of a night 
owl so i try to sleep when he does when I can.  We are ion a feeding frenzy 
every 21/2 to 3 hours and I'm hoping I can extend that at night soon.  Any 
suggestions?  What type of formula do you use?  Alos, do you have any secret 
methods for putting Jillian down to sleep?  Do you let her suck on a 
pacifier?  All Charles wants to do is suck on me.  Arthur was better at 
falling asleep on his own.

How's Jillian doing ?  I can't wait to see a picture of her and I will be 
sending out pictures soon.  Arthur is adjusting well.  He is really into 
tennis now which I am thrilled about.  We were able to convince Bill's mother 
not to come this weekend because I am not quite up to a visit.  I think she 
took it well but you never can tell, but at this point I really don't care 
what she thinks because i am not ready for her to visit until I'm more mobile 
which hopefully I will be in another week or 2.



Sue,
How are you and Cate doing?  Can you talk to mom about scheduling a  visit so 
that we can schedule a christening date?  Bill's older sister's husband Bill 
is the godfather.  Mom mentioned late August but I would like to pin 
something down soon so that we can make the necessary arrangements.


Well, I've got to go as I hear Charles waking up.  Take care both of you and 
call or write me.

Love, Carol

Thanks for the feed-back. To assist in the further development of the
product, are there any specific areas your group would like to see improved
? Based on comments made during our meeting, it sounded like your main
concern was whether or not CHARM would have the capacity to cover the very
different and complex risk areas that your company is involved in. Would
you mind if someone from our CHARM group called you or Mr. Kaminski for
some specific comments ?

Greetings Vince!
=09During the brief idle moments we have here in the lab, I have been ponde=
ring yet another possible project.  We have built sensor boards and written=
 programs to calculate the current flow along High Voltage Direct Current l=
ines, the type that form the Western Inter-tie.    There are six of these l=
ines to the west, i.e. to the WSCC  - four between WSCC and MAPP and two be=

s flowing between them.  (In this case, directionality is no problem.  For =
once there is actually something flowing!)  Of course if this is useful, th=
e project could expand to other inter-regional zones.  HVDC lines exist in =
the northeast between the large Canadian hydro projects and the metropolita=
n cities in New England.  Globally, there are several large grids being for=
med - one in Scandinavia, one in North Africa, an East Russian/Chinese syst=
em and a Russian/Korean/Japanese system.  Naturally these have to connect i=
nternally with DC lines as there are power frequency, power reliability and=
 power control differences between each of the generating countries.

"Well, the staff level is prettly low here, for just about every group related to HPL.  Stacey did leave, so I am back to trading Waha.  However, it's going a lot better this time.  I am actualy enjoying it somewhat.  With the majority of the desk leaving, I am looking into moving into the day trading arena for the new Texas Desk.  We'll see how that goes.  Bidweek was kinda rough this time.  In addition to Stacey leaving during the middle of the week, we have some major outages on the A/S line where we have to stay balanced on Texoma and balanced on the south end.  The line has been split into two seperate systems.  Handling that has been a constant battle.  Plus, with the pending sale, people just don't care as much about the business.  It's a little harder to get things done.

Anyway, things are going pretty good at the house.  But, the list of things to fix and do keeps getting longer and longer.  We are extremely busy.  The kids are loving the stairs.  You ought to see Jake go down.  We taught him to turn around backwards and crawl down the stairs on his belly.  Well, that was too slow for him.  Now, he get's on his belly, feet up in the air, and slides down, barely skiming the stairs.  He looks a penguin sliding down a snow bank, except on his stomach.  Cole is doing his best to either run Jake off or make him tough.  Cole runs over Jake with his toys, pushes Jake out the way, or just walks right over him.  It doesn't affect Jake, though, he gets right back up and keeps on going.

Anyway, I need to get back to work.  Hope the family is doing well.  Maybe you can come down for lunch next week.  I'll give you a call in the next couple of days.

Elizabeth,
Below is the one comment from Pacificorp on the CA that I had marked up.  I am attaching the markup I had sent to Pacificorp.  Prior to sending execution copies I thought you might want to look at it in light of the fact that the contingent call option portion of the proposed transactions would likely be a physical deal with EPMI.  I am taking the next two days off but will be back on Monday.

""Volatility of Electricity  Prices - Measurement and Analysis of Underlying  
Causes""
Dr.  Vincent Kaminski
Managing Director and Head of Research for Enron  Corp.

?

Abstract:

The last three years were characterized  by exceptionally high volatility of 
the power prices in the US markets. The  market developments have created a 
number of unique challenges for energy  industry economists. One immediate 
question we have to answer is how to  measure volatility of energy prices. 
Although we can all agree that the  prices in the power markets are 
characterized by high variability, the  traditional measures used in 
financial economics (annualized standard  deviation of log price returns) may 
not fit well electricity prices.  


The second challenge is to explain the  sources of high price volatility and 
to answer the question to what extent  it can be attributed to problems that 
can be addressed in the long run. Such  problems include flaws in market 
design that allow some market participants  to abuse market power, limited 
availability and/or unequal access to  transmission, temporary shortages of 
generation capacity. Some factors  underlying high volatility of electricity 
prices may be of permanent nature  and may be a necessary price to pay for 
increased market efficiency and  expanded customer choice.

Subject: Half-Hourly Option Forward Volatilities

Dear all,

Firstly, apologies for the delay in finalising this study; a considerable 
amount of data analysis was required.  The idea is to aggregate monthly, 
weekly and daily volatilities such that we can price individual options on 
half hours into the future.  We have a reliable methodology for the monthly 
vol curve at the EFA slot level.  The first issue to address was to use a 
""reverse basvol"" to estimate the monthly vol curve at the half-hourly level 
of detail.  This required an estimation of half-hourly price return 
correlations.  This resulted in a scaling factor of approximately 1.30 that 
is applied to all EFA vols to convert to half-hourly (the scaling factors are 
slightly different by EFA slot, but not by nearly as much as might be 
expected). 

For the weekly and hourly half hourly vols, a historical analysis was carried 
out on the past few years data; a weighting-scheme was applied to add more 
emphasis to standard deviations calculated on more recent data.  

COMBINING THE VOLATILITIES
The idea is to let the monthly vol curve get us to the start of the month and 
then assume that all half hours are positioned at 2 weeks and 3 days into the 
next month.  The volatility is aggregated using these time-weightings to 
ensure that we don't have a wildly different volatility for the options at 
the start of a month and at the end of a month.  Below is an example for half 
hour #38:

I put the spreadsheet HalfHourlyVolModel.xls into the public directory, 
S:\RESEARCH\ANJAM\HHOPTIONVOLMODEL\. I suggest we use the matrix of forward 
volatilities on the summary page and see what kind of numbers we get.  There 
may need to be some fine-tuning of the time-weightings, but in general, I 
believe we can start utilising these semi-final numbers.

Regards,

Anjam

Also, there are two ways of getting edit access through this database.  One

Thank you for suggesting the group that we talked to today.  They all seemed 
to be at the same level and hopefully got something out of what we said 
today.  I mentioned to them that you have all of the latest LC and Guaranty 
forms and that you would be sending those around to them.  I will work on the 
form of confidentiality agreement and send that to you next week.  Before I 
go on maternity leave, I will send down to you a binder with hard copies of 
all of our forms, along with the User's Guides to the ISDA and CSA.  We are 
still putting the finishing touches on the ISDA and CSA Schedules.

Could you also mention/remind the group that now Samantha Boyd's name should 
be added to all credit worksheets and Tana'a name taken off and that all day

is off the day to day stuff and working primarily on special projects?

Subject: FERC Staff Concerns on the Gas Side

Folks -- 

Had a good discussion with a Senior Staff member at FERC in preparation for 
the Pipelines Outreach meeting next week.  He told me that the two issues on 
the gas side that are of primary concern to the Commission are 1) Marketing 
Affiliates and potential abuse on the pipelines (Think El Paso); and 2) the 
failure of CFTC and/or SEC to more closely oversee derivative trading. 

Apparently, staff is considering whether to ban all transactions by marketers 
on an affiliated pipeline, and some form of filing/reporting requirement to 
better understand the derivative market.  Due to a lack of information, some 
at FERC are assuming the worst.    

I believe these proposals are in the formative stage and have not been 
presented to Senior Staff or Commissioners as a recommendation.  I think 
Staff would appreciate some information (ammo) to refute the need to further 
regulate marketing affiliates or delve into derivative trading.

INGAA filed comments and a study concerning Marketers' use of affiliated 
pipelines in response to the Marketing Affiliate Conference at FERC.  These 
are attached.   Staff questions whether the underlying information remains 
accurate.  We are considering whether to update the underlying information 
used in the INGAA Study and how best to address these issues (probably during 
Q&As) during the Staff Outreach.

I believe it would be helpful to put back together the coalition that Leslie 
Lawner used at the last Market Affiliate conference to request a meeting as 
part of the current Staff Outreach to discuss Staff's concerns.  In addition, 
I think it would be helpful to request a separate ENRON meeting with Staff to 
discuss how the derivative market works and why FERC does not need to 
establish ongoing reporting requirements or otherwise become involved in 
these markets.  Unfortunately, in this meeting we would probably be asked 
about our involvement in the El Paso Merchant Transportation deal into 
California, in light of Peggy Hegg's comment on the Frontline Show that El 
Paso hedged some of the risk with Enron.  

We can discuss further on Friday's call.  Later Joe

Vince,

Nothing like a real deal to focus our thoughts on JCC.  JA Aichi is an agricultural association that purchases over 200,000kl per year of Heavy A.  They would like Enron to price a JCC swap (our offer) that would help them manage their Oct 2001 to Mar 02 position as given below.  I'd like to see what we could offer given the volumes and term.  We can then compare with the JCC offers shown by MS.  We are checking the credit of this company.

It would be good to put a live deal in front of Shankman that wasn't too huge or of too long term.  Concept of minimizing the cost of our education and testing our hedging strategy for JCC.

Let me know if you need additional info.  I presume that you are fairly far along with evaluation of JCC and that we should be able to derive an offer?  If not, please let me know.  If possible we'd like to send out an offer next week.

thanks.

Joe

Please refer to the conversation we just had.
Customer (JA Aichi) is looking for to hedge Heavy A (Low Sulphar A) with Index as follows : 
I am already contacting Singapore Office for Dubai Index or Singapore Gas Oil Index but not JCC. 
The condition is as follows:

1. Enron sells swap to JA Aichi (Financially Swap settled monthly)
2. Index    : JCC 
3. Period   : Oct 2001 to March 2002
4. Volume : Oct 2001 : 1,000 KL (  6,289 Barrel)
                  Nov 2001 : 1,000 KL (  6,289 Barrel)
                  Dec 2001 : 5,000 KL (31,447 Barrel)
                  Jan 2002  : 5,000 KL (31,447 Barrel) 
                  Feb 2002 : 5,000 KL (31,447 Barrel) 
                  Mar 2002 : 3,000 KL (18,868 Barrel)

                  Total         20,000 KL (125,787Barrel)

Please let me know if you need further information.

Hi, How are you doing ? 

Have received an inquiry form JA Aichi (Different from UNICOOP) in Japan as follows: 

In order to hedge the price of Low Sulphur A, they want to enter the swap based on 
Crude Oil Index or Gas Oil Index, since it has a correlation with the product. 
It would be very appreciated if you could give me a price as following. 

1. Enron sells swap to JA Aichi (Financially Swap settled monthly)
2. Index    : Dubai Crude Oil, Platts Singapore Gas Oil Reg. 0.5% 
3. Period   : Oct 2001 to March 2002
4. Volume : Oct 2001 : 1,000 KL (  6,289 Barrel)
                  Nov 2001 : 1,000 KL (  6,289 Barrel)
                  Dec 2001 : 5,000 KL (31,447 Barrel)
                  Jan 2002  : 5,000 KL (31,447 Barrel) 
                  Feb 2002 : 5,000 KL (31,447 Barrel) 
                  Mar 2002 : 3,000 KL (18,868 Barrel)

                  Total         20,000 KL (125,787Barrel)

odd unto itself, since state legislation to openly provide billions of doll=
ars in benefits to one private corporation may be unprecedented.=20

Literally dozens of versions of legislation to bail out Edison have floated=
 around the Capitol, ever since Davis announced last spring that he had rea=
ched agreement with John Bryson, chairman of Edison International, the util=
ity's parent corporation. The Edison deal was announced just a few days aft=
er PG&E rejected Davis' overtures and took itself into bankruptcy court. Bo=
th utilities ran up many billions of dollars in debts buying power in the l=
ast six months of 2000 because the state rejected their pleas to raise reta=
il rates.=20

Edison's -- or perhaps Bryson's -- fear of bankruptcy is another puzzling a=
spect of the issue, given the almost cheerful manner in which PG&E placed i=
tself in receivership. Edison has spent millions of dollars on lobbying, ad=
vertising and other forms of political persuasion, trying to nudge the Legi=
slature into passing a rescue plan that lawmakers are clearly reluctant to =
do.=20

Is avoiding bankruptcy a matter of personal pride for Bryson? Or, as some s=
uggest, does it stem from Edison's tardiness in erecting an impregnable fin=
ancial fire wall between the utility's assets and those of the parent holdi=
ng company, Edison International? Edison scrambled to build a fire wall aft=
er bankruptcy loomed, but financial analysts are uncertain that it's as str=
ong as PG&E's.=20

The dynamics within the Capitol and among various interest groups are equal=
ly odd, following none of the patterns that usually explain why politicians=
 do what they do. Legislators of both parties are all over the map on the E=
dison issue, and factions that are ordinarily allied find themselves at odd=
s. One example: Liberal consumer groups are strenuously opposing any bailou=
t for the utility, while liberal environmentalists like the current scheme =
because it would bring thousands of acres of Edison-owned Sierra watershed =
under state control.=20

Perhaps the most mysterious aspect of the Edison situation is why Davis, or=
dinarily the most cautious, commitment-averse of politicians, is making suc=
h a crusade of keeping the utility out of bankruptcy court. Why would Davis=
 put so much of his gubernatorial prestige behind such an iffy proposition =
that exposes him to leverage from lawmakers seeking other favors from the g=
overnor and, polls indicate, is not popular with voters?=20

Harvey Rosenfield, the consumer gadfly who has established a ""war room"" nea=
r the Capitol to fight the Edison scheme, believes that Davis' unusual effo=
rts stem from a desire to run for president in 2004 and a fear that Wall St=
reet would blackball him if Edison follows PG&E into bankruptcy court.=20

Another possible explanation is Davis' decades-long relationship with Bryso=
n. The two served together in former Gov. Jerry Brown's administration (Bry=
son was Brown's Public Utilities Commission president) and both have strong=
 ties to the Democratic political organization in West Los Angeles headed b=
y Reps. Henry Waxman and Howard Berman, who, in effect, allowed Davis to la=
unch his career by winning a West Side state Assembly seat in 1982.=20

The most influential member of Edison's board of directors is Warren Christ=
opher, a Democratic elder statesman and former secretary of state. Bryson a=
nd Christopher flew to Sacramento late last year to plead with Davis to tak=
e command of the energy crisis, allow utilities to raise rates and staunch =
the red ink. Davis refused, and nearly a year later finds himself trying to=
 keep Edison out of bankruptcy court.=20

We may never know why Davis is going to bat for Edison, but we will know, v=
ery soon, whether he can pull it off or will wind up with egg on his face.=

   California Power-Buying Data Disclosed in Misdirected E-Mail By Daniel T=
aub  Sacramento, California, July 6 (Bloomberg) -- California Governor Gray=
 Davis's office released data on the state's purchases in the spot electric=
ity market -- information Davis has been trying to keep secret -- through a=
 misdirected e-mail.  The e-mail, containing data on California's power pur=
chases yesterday, was intended for members of the governor's staff, said Da=
vis spokesman Steve Maviglio. It was accidentally sent to some reporters on=
 the office's press list, he said.  Davis is fighting disclosure of state p=
ower purchases, saying it would compromise negotiations for future contract=
s. This week, Davis appealed a state judge's order to release spot-market i=
nvoices, purchase orders and confirmation sheets for power contracts signed=
 through June 27. The state is buying electricity on behalf of utilities, w=
hich are burdened by debt.  ``It's an internal document,'' Maviglio said of=
 the e-mail. ``We have a meeting every morning where we discuss issues of t=
he day.'' The e-mail contained minutes of today's meeting, he said.  Accord=
ing to the e-mail, the state bought 283,000 megawatt- hours of electricity =
for $37.4 million yesterday. One megawatt- hour is enough electricity to li=
ght 750 typical California homes for an hour. Prices ranged from $25 to $14=
9.99 a megawatt-hour. Maviglio said the information in the e-mail is accura=
te.  Power for next-day delivery during peak-use hours averaged $79.67 a me=
gawatt-hour on the California-Oregon border yesterday, according to Bloombe=
rg Energy Service. California paid an average of $132 on the spot market, a=
ccording to the e-mail. Prices on the spot market tend to be higher than on=
 the day-ahead market.  The governor has proposed releasing data on spot-ma=
rket purchases once a quarter, arguing that the state uses power-buying str=
ategies tailored to each season. Lawyers for the media and Republican legis=
lators say state law requires disclosure of contracts within seven days aft=
er they are signed.  =09

 ""We applaud the Governor?s plan to increase electric generating capacity i=

""Rather than using tax money, we?re investing billions of private-sector

possible to conserve electricity at home and work.""

Subject: Re: ISDA Enron Europe  

John, I would be very interested to see what the local derivatives market is 
developing.  My guess is that the document is probably being prepared for 
transactions between two Argentine companies.  If this is the case I would 
also like to know what is being done on the tax side by the association to 
fix the tax problems caused by doing swaps in Argentina.  If the Argentine 
Association of Derivatives has a draft we would like to study it.  Also, are 
we going to become a member of this association and are we going to send 
someone to the meetings regularly?  Do we have any brochures or other 
information regarding the makeup of the association?  

From my conversations with Mark Taylor I do not think that ISDA has any plans 
to implement a Spanish language ISDA master.  The translation process of the 
master, the schedules, and all of the various definition books would be a 
serious undertaking (there are literally hundreds of pages of documentation 
that would have to be legally translated).  And most US companies that make a 
market in derivatives products would not have the legal and back-office 
personnel to negotiate and process masters and transactions in Spanish.  I 
know that ENA does not have the capacity to do this at the moment.  I think 
the only other language ISDA is published in is Japanese and that is a 
restricted format used only between two Japanese companies for a limited 
number of types of trades specific to the Japanese market.  English will 
likely remain the language of choice in international transactions such as 
what we are doing now between ENA and Argentine counterparties.  If the tax 
situation in Argentina were to change and ESA sets up its own trading entity 
in Argentina with front, back and middle offices, then the language issue 
could be assessed locally.  

I wish there were a simple answer to the current situation.  Please keep me 
updated in any local market information you come across.  

Thanks,
Brent

Subject: Re: ISDA Enron Europe  

I'm in the need of informing the whole team that Argentina through the 
Argentine Association of Derivatives has developed a document that's 
circulating in the market and will surely be optimised to the extent that 
Argentine companies will use it in the near future if not inmediately. This 
document has been prepared by experienced groups of professionals with 
foreign support on terms of credit and legal issues. 

My impression is that will be competing against that document in a great deal 
of disadvantage. This disadvantage will be a ""cultural"" disadvantage from the 
moment that latin american countries tend to have ""shorter"" documents written 
in the local language where the transaction is taking place. 
If the ISDA was at least written in Spanish (rather than French or German) it 
would be of great help. This is an issue that really ""tickles"" me: Why isn't 
the ISDA document translated into Spanish being that it is after English 
probably the language most spoken through out the globe and second that 
there's much more opportunity of selling Risk Management Products to Latin 
American countries rather than French companies through my more than 
disappointing experience in trying to close a deal with French Total.

I believe Sara's visit would be more that important. I'll try to forward 
everybody a copy of the document that was drafted in Argentina for 
everybody's info.

I strongly believe in the matters of evolution and I'm sure that in the 
future ESA's market will mature in such a way that will just like Enron 
Europe a document to match market's needs.

I have taken a quick look at the schedules attached and unfortunately they are not standard ISDA schedules and are not in a form to which we can agree.  We can provide ISDA documentation to you tomorrow which would be satisfactory from a legal perspective but it will not be exactly the form attached to their e-mail.  We will also need Credit's approval and they rarely approve ISDA masters without any credit provisions.  There is an existing ISDA between ENA and an entity called Entergy-Koch Trading, LP which we would be able to use from our side but I don't know if that would work for them.  (It's existence might speed the negotiation process for an ISDA since we could pretty much duplicate its terms [except for credit and the additional provisions we require for regulated utilities] for Entergy.)

          Writer Patrick O'Brian Dies at 85


          A.P. INDEXES: TOP STORIES | NEWS | SPORTS | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | 
ENTERTAINMENT 


          Filed at 3:21 p.m. EST

          By The Associated Press

          LONDON (AP) -- Patrick O'Brian, whose celebrated novels of 19th
          century seafaring won praise from critics and the loyalty of 
legions of
          readers, has died. He was 85. 

          O'Brian died in Dublin, Ireland, where he had been working on a book
          for several weeks at Trinity College. The cause of death was not 
given
          and there were conflicting reports of the date. 

          The British Embassy in Paris said O'Brian died Tuesday, but 
newspapers
          and the news agency Press Association said he died Sunday. O'Brian
          had lived in France since 1949. 

          O'Brian's major work was a 20-volume series set in the Royal Navy
          during the Napoleonic wars. 

          A deep knowledge of naval history and 19th century life enabled him 
to
          evoke a time and place so vividly that, in this era of supersonic 
jets and
          smart bombs, his readers were gripped by the slow-motion suspense of
          sea battles fought under sail. 

          The series, begun in 1969 with ``Master and Commander,'' is the 
story
          of the friendship between a bold and ambitious navy officer, Jack
          Aubrey, and the ship's surgeon Stephen Maturin, a naturalist and 
secret
          agent who doesn't much like sailing. 

          Although the books were well-reviewed and found an enthusiastic
          readership from the start, it wasn't until the 1990s that they 
achieved
          wide recognition abroad and were lifted out of the ``historical 
fiction''
          genre in which they generally were reviewed. 

          In 1991, a New York Times critic called O'Brian ``the best novelist 
you
          have never heard of.'' 

          ``Patrick O'Brian has written great and enduring literature which 
happens
          to be set largely at sea,'' the Sunday Telegraph wrote in 1997, 
praising
          ``the intensity of characterization, the complex elegance of the 
plotting,
          and the brilliance of the writing.'' 

          O'Brian also proved that, in the hands of a skilled writer, 
specialist
          language need not be an obstacle to understanding. Readers who can't
          remember which side of a ship is starboard still can feel the 
frantic activity
          on deck as the sails unfurl and catch the wind, and the excitement 
as a
          man-of-war turns to engage the enemy. 

          A lexicon explaining O'Brian's nautical terminology was published, 
but
          O'Brian didn't think definitions important. 

          ``Ignorance of the cross-catharpins is not necessarily fatal,'' he 
once said.
          ``Explanation almost certainly would be.'' 

          O'Brian's fans range from actor Charlton Heston to critic John 
Bayley, a
          former Oxford professor of literature who wrote that O'Brian's
          ``originality consists in the unpretentious use he makes of 
(history) to
          invent a new style of fiction.'' 

          ``No other writer,'' Bayley wrote, ``not even Melville, has 
described the
          whale and the wandering albatross with O'Brian's studious and yet 
lyrical
          accuracy.'' 

          O'Brian guarded his privacy, and in his few interviews resisted 
questions
          about his personal life. 

          He was born Dec. 12, 1914, in Chalfont St. Peter, west of London, 
and
          it wasn't until 1998 that he was revealed to be the son of an 
English
          doctor and not an Irishman as had been widely believed, the Daily
          Telegraph said in an obituary Friday. 

          The newspaper said O'Brian was born Richard Patrick Russ, but
          changed his name in 1945. During his school years, he was 
frequently ill,
          spending much time reading. His writing career began at age 15, 
when he
          published a book about the union of a giant panda and a snow 
leopard. 

          During World War II, O'Brian drove ambulances and worked briefly
          with Britain's Political Intelligence Department. 

          In 1949, he and his second wife, Mary, moved to Collioure, southern
          France. His first seafaring novel was ``The Golden Ocean'' in 1956,
          about a Pacific expedition. 

          O'Brian's Aubrey-Maturin series was already well under way in 
Britain
          by the beginning of the 1990s, when editor Starling Lawrence of the
          American publisher W.W. Norton chanced to read one on a flight 
home. 

          The rest, as they say, is publishing history. 

          Several years ago, the writer said he would end the series with the 
20th
          book, but last month he said he was working on volume 21, the Daily
          Telegraph reported. 

          O'Brian also wrote biographies of Picasso and naturalist Sir Joseph
          Banks. A linguist, he translated the work of French writers Simone 
de
          Beauvoir and Colette. 

          O'Brian was made a Commander of the Order of British Empire in 1995.

          Funeral plans were not announced. He is survived by a son, Richard,
          from his first marriage. "

"Brian,

What about meeting around 5:50 - 6:00 p.m. at the Angelica Movie Center
on Smith. There is an underground parking between Smith and Louisiana
and the movie theater will validate your parking ticket.

There are several bars at the center.

The movie starts at 7:00 with some boring speeches. Saturday should be more
interesting - it's a comedy day.

"I'm still not wild about 27.5, which says they have no liability for any 
advice they give us which is not required by the agreement.  It seems that we 
could get into an argument about causation of a problem, and what was in/out 
of their scope under the agreement.  

I don't know that I have any brilliant ideas about how to narrow this carve 
out. I guess we could say no liability so long as the advice is clearly 
outside the scope of work, and is given in good faith and in accordance with 
industry standards.

Re:  Acquisition of General Electric 7EA Turbines

Ladies and Gentlemen:

Pursuant to our discussions last week, the following summarizes the main=20
commercial terms agreed to by NorthWestern Corporation (=01&NorthWestern=01=
8) and=20
Enron North America Corp. (""ENA"") regarding NorthWestern=01,s purchase thro=
ugh=20
the LLC referred to below or as otherwise accomplished without violation of=
=20
the Turbine Contract referred to below (the =01&Purchase=018) of two (2) Ge=
neral=20
Electric (=01&GE=018) 7EA combustion turbines (the =01&Turbines=018), the f=
irst of which=20
is presently located at a GE storage facility, and the second of which is=
=20
scheduled to be available for delivery in February, 2002, and both of which=
=20
are subject to purchase from GE under an agreement with GE dated as of May=
=20
31, 2000 (the =01&Turbine Contract=018) with respect to which ENA has the r=
ight to=20
cause a joint venture limited liability company in which, prior to commerci=
al=20
operation of the Turbines, ENA holds a 20% equity interest and a wholly-own=
ed=20
NorthWestern subsidiary (the =01&NorthWestern Subsidiary=018) holds an 80% =
equity=20
interest (the =01&LLC=018) to become the purchaser:

1.  Purchase Price:  NorthWestern will pay ENA $48.0 million for the Turbin=
es=20
(subject to adjustment as described below). [Adjusted how?  Need specific=
=20
reference. Is the statement that the payment is for the turbines consistent=
=20
with the structure?  Definitely sounds like a UCC deal,  for what that=01,s=
=20
worth.]
2.  Closing Date of Purchase:  The Purchase will close on a date on or prio=
r=20
to September 1, 2001, as selected by NorthWestern by not less than 30 days=
=01,=20
written notice to ENA,(provided that such notice may not be given less than=
=20
30 days after the signing of a definitive agreement relating to the=20
Purchase).  [What happens at closing?  Payment of the balance?  In the=20
interim are we going to be obligated to perform under the GE contract in a=
=20
certain manner?  Are we taking on implied obligations to NW?]
3.  Cash Down Payment:  NorthWestern will pay ENA an $8.0 million down=20
payment for the Turbines.  The first installment ($3.0 million) of the $8.0=
=20
million down payment will be due upon the signing of a definitive agreement=
=20
with ENA providing for the Purchase.  The second installment ($5.0 million)=
=20
of the $8.0 million down payment will be due at the earlier of (i) closing =
of=20
the Purchase, or (ii) July 15, 2001. [The remaining $40m due at closing, as=
=20
well as any other amounts due to changes, etc?]
4.  Liquidated Damages:   If, prior to the assignment of the Turbine Contra=
ct=20
[is proper reference to closing?], the purchaser under the Turbine Contract=
=20
receives any liquidated damages under the Turbine Contract, then ENA will=
=20
give notice thereof to NorthWestern as promptly as possible. [Then what?]
5.  Carry Period:  ENA will provide an interest-free carry on the unpaid=20
purchase price of the Turbines until July 15, 2001. If the closing of the=
=20
Purchase occurs after July 15, 2001, then the unpaid purchase price of the=
=20
Turbines will be increased by interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum on the=
=20
unpaid purchase price of the Turbines ($40.0 million) for each day from, an=
d=20
including, July 15, 2001 to, but excluding, the closing date.
6.  Dual Fuel Conversion on Unit 2:  ENA will not proceed with this change=
=20
order to effect the conversion.  Instead, it will be the responsibility of=
=20
NorthWestern to effect the change order with GE.  [does this mean they will=
=20
be negotiating a change order while E Next is still the purchaser? Are we=
=20
committing to pay for the increase?  Does the purchase price increase?  Is=
=20
there a limit?]
7.  Unpaid Price of Second Turbine:  At the time of closing, one or more=20
installments of the purchase price of the second Turbine will be payable to=
=20
GE under the Turbine Contract (the =01&Unpaid Installments=018).  ENA will =
be=20
obligated to pay the Unpaid Installments to GE as they become due under the=
=20
Turbine Contract.=20
8.  Guarantees:   There will be no guarantee by Enron Corporation of any of=
=20
the representations, warranties, covenants, indemnities or other obligation=
s=20
of ENA in connection with the Purchase.  All obligations of the LLC under t=
he=20

Subject: Summary of Today's Call/Agenda for Tomorrow's Call


Greetings:
n order to keep everyone in the loop, the folks on today's call wanted to
send out a brief summary of the call for the benefit of those who couldn't
make it.  Apologies for any omissions, inaccuracies, etc.  Others who were
on the call please chime in if I've gotten anything wrong, or missed
anything.

Best,
Jeff

SUMMARY
   Enron, Duke, El Paso and Williams were on the call, as was Michael
   Hoffman of the Blackstone Group (the Governor's financial advisors).
   On the subject of how the group would organize itself, it was agreed
   that the calls would be open to anyone who wanted to participate.
   A smaller group consisting of Duke, El Paso, Enron, and Williams would
   take the lead on walking the halls of Sacramento, meeting with policy
   makers, and advocating whatever plan the group develops.
   Folks agreed that achieving a comprehesive solution requires a tangible
   process; that is, the principals need to get in a room, face to face,
   for however long it takes to work out a resolution.
   It was agreed that the process should start no later than the beginning
   of next week, and that it should take place in Sacramento.
   It was decided that the Legislature and the Attorney General needed to
   be brought into the process as soon as possible, i.e., next week.
   There was some discussion regarding the release today of ""Plan B.""  Plan
   B is a plan proposed by Democratic and Republican legislators as an
   alternative to the MOU that the Governor struck with Edison.  After that
   call I received a copy of ""Plan B.""  If you'd like a copy please send me
   your fax number.
   Folks on the call agreed to have the next ""supplier-only"" call-in
   meeting on Friday.
   Finally, Michael Hoffman said that they are hoping to have a ""ratings
   agency level"" presentation prepared by the end of the week.  The goal of
   the presentation is to reassure capital markets that the bonds the state
   seeks to issue are solidly backed by retail rates.

The Agenda for Tomorrow's Call with the Governor's Staff
Item #1:       The Credit Issue
   Michael Hoffman said that the Governor's office wants to start
   tomorrow's meeting discussing the creditworthiness issue.
   Hoffman said that the Governor's folks are hoping to have completed by
   the start of tomorrow's meeting a draft of an agreement between the
   California PUC and CDWR.  The agreement is designed to ensure that DWR
   gets paid for power services delivered.
   If the draft is ready, they'd like to discuss on the call tomorrow.

Item #2:       Identify the Components of a Comprehensive Solution.
   It was agreed that our group should put on the table at tomorrow's
   meeting the universe of issues that need to be included in a
   comprehensive solution.
   Enron was asked to take a first stab at what those components are.  The
   following is a brief outline, which is not intended to be definitive,
   but a starting point for discussion.
     Utility creditworthiness
        retail rates must reflect costs
     Increase supply
        streamline and otherwise reform the siting process
     Decrease demand
        establish real-time pricing
        implement demand buy-down and other conservation programs
     Create a real market
        Remove the State from the power-buying business as soon as possible
        (e.g., once new rates are in place and utilities are returned to
        creditworthiness; approximately 3-6 months)
        Return the procurement role to the utilities
        Reinstate Direct Access immediately for all customers
        Within 18-24 months, create a ""core/noncore"" market structure for
        electricity, similar to California's market structure for natural
        gas
     Keep the industry in the hands of the private sector
        Reject proposals calling on the State to take over transmission,
        generation, etc.
     Resolve outstanding legal claims, investigations, etc.
        Resolution requires certainty and prompt payment (understanding
        that discounts on receivables is on the table for discussion)

"
"The following points refer to the methodology that we are taking to rebook 
the New Albany Plant.  Please send me a note immediately if you disagree.
Assume that NewAlb is a non mark to market entity and Enron is the mark to 
market entity.  However, it is fully owned and operated by us for now.


*  The power mark to market book will pay NewAlb a capacity payment of $4.87 
for 5 years.  We shaped this payment as follows:

2001 - $5.06
2002 - $4.96
2003 - $4.86
2004 - $4.75
2005 - $4.65

*  This payments allows Enron to supply gas to NewAlb and receive power. 

*  Enron will pay NewAlb $1000 per unit start.

*  Enron will also pay NewAlb $1.05/MW hour for varialbe o&m.

*  This will create an entity ""NewAlb"" that will return 9% assuming a book 
value of $336/kw on 12/31/2005 vs. 409 currently.

*  If NewAlb pays the 9% out that entity should be relatively flat each year 
for the next five."

Dear Doug,

I decided to wait until after Christmas to respond to your letter.

I have drafted an amended petition which adds Randy, Steve, and Enron as
defendants.  Among other matters, the petition includes tort claims arising
from acts of slander, fraud, and tortious interference with contract.

You have been critical of my decision to file the original petition in
September because, as I understand it, you believed that I had failed to
exhaust other avenues for redress.  I believe that every other potential
means of resolution had been exhausted.  However, in respect for your offer
of constructive criticism, I would like to once again extend an offer for
mediation in an attempt to resolve the ECOGAS matter, and now these matters.

I called your office and understand that you are not in today.  As I
anticipate that you may be on vacation this week, I will wait until next
week before proceeding with any new filings.

Please contact me if mediation is of any interest to your client.  If it
won't be you, please let me know if you happen to know who will be
representing the additional defendants.

Best regards,
Tom

Enron Corp, (global finance) has a FASB 125 structured deal executed in Dec., 
2000 which requires amendment for tax purposes.  A new  total return equity 
swap on EOG stock will need to be executed between ENA and Rabo.  ENA must be 
the swap counterparty (""normal course of business"") for the legal opinion 
which must be issued for the structure.  I would like to send Rabo our ISDA 
format so as to avoid any surprises; time is short.  I assume we do not want

2. We can detect ""market power"" by dissociating the seller from the buyer, 
distinguishing between the physical ""cost"" in gas to run the generators and 
the transmission cost in dollars, i.e. the basis.

3. (As you noted) We can detect ""storage"" as the difference between inflow 
and consumption.

It appears to me there are two time series needed for a straightforward model 
of gas prices: flow rates at interconnects (from telemetry) and spot-market 
prices. There is an elevated basis reflecting pipeline companies monopolizing 
capacity, as well as hoarding of capacity by contracts. The dynamics of gas 
prices reflect consumption demand changes due to changes in expectations for 
the weather, as well as their impact on two highly strategic behaviors: 
hoarding of pipeline capacity and storage of gas.  We can ""calibrate"" the 
price elasticity of demands for consumption and storage, and the price 
elasticities of demand for transmission, as well as the extent of hoarding, 
from the two sets of numbers mentioned: flows and prices.  What the basis 
trader needs to understand are the incentives, and disincentives, for storage 
and capacity-hoarding, in terms of the calibrated price-elasticities, and 
each of these are as-if exotic call options at the consumption hub.  Finally, 
flows are ""explained"" by the model, and can be imputed from prices if 
necessary, resulting in a purely stochastic model of the basis in terms of 
the weather.

I believe the problem is quite tractable, and I would like to proceed with a 
model.

I  enjoyed talking with you this afternoon regarding possible Enron/Argonne  
National Laboratory collaboration. As I mentioned, one of our  divisions, 
Decision Information Sciences has built state of the art tools  for modeling 
and simulating energy use. They have trained many country  energy ministries 
on the use of their tools as well as solved complex energy  technology issues.
 
I've  attached a presentation which describes some of their capabilities in 
this area.  Decision Information Sciences also has done much work in studying 
critical  infrastructure issues in both gas and electric systems which also 
may be of  interest. Finally, they have been pioneers in the development of 
agent  based complex adaptive systems for modeling very complex systems that  
are impossible to view with over approaches.
 
I will also include a copy of my  correspondences with one of your e-business 
groups under separate  transmission.

information we have already turned over to the experts.  Based upon a

me to meet with Jeff in Portland to try and solve some of these problems.  I
want to avoid creating multiple databases and both Jeff and I believe it
will be easier to resolve these issues with both the people and the
information at his fingertips.  I am also scheduled to meet with the
Portland General traders on Wednesday to do the audit of their trading
practices as we discussed when we were both last in Portland.  I also plan
to spend a few minutes with Tim Belden to learn what additional information
he might have about my understanding of the trading practices.  If you need
more details, please let me know.

 Hope you had a pleasant 3 day weekend.

Subject:	Conversation with Edison re: Getting Negative CTC Paid

I talked to John Fielder (SVP Edison) about setting up a meeting for Barry Tycholiz with Edison's CFO about hedging Edison's QF price risk. Fielder wanted to talk about the negative CTC issue. Here's what he said:

They plan to ""settle"" with the ESPs and pay them when they pay everyone else, which he re-iterated would be sometime in Q1'02.
Edison is holding firm to the notion that the negative CTC contributed to the utility's undercollection and that the ESP's share of the undercollection has to be netted against the payables attributable to the negative CTC and owed the ESP.
He said that they will propose to net it out in one of two ways:  1) lump sum netting (i.e., if they owe $50MM and the share of the undercollection is $30 MM, then they pay the ESP $20 MM; or 2) future reductions in PX Credit (i.e., they pay the ESP $50 MM, and then reduce the PX going forward until the $30 MM is paid down).  The numbers are illustrative only.
In addition, he said that they have the view that a decision is going to have to be made about 1) whether DA customers pay for stranded costs tied to the DWR L-T contracts, and 2) whether DA customers pay going forward for stranded costs tied to the QF contracts.  (Edison is clearly lobbying the PUC to get DA customers to pay for these costs.)
I recommended strongly that he de-link issues 1 and 2 above from the issue of paying us ASAP what they owe us for negative CTC.  He agreed.
He said that the PUC judge's recently issued pre-hearing conference order requires that Edison ""meet and confer"" with ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th hearing, and that Edison intends to set something up with ESPs prior to that hearing.
Fielder is also the point person on ""getting ESPs paid"" and intends to initiate settlement discussions with ESPs week after next.
It was very clear from the conversation that Edison is going to do everything possible (at the expense of creditors) to maximize headroom under the settlement it struck with the PUC a few weeks ago.  Edison's stalemate with the QFs is evidence of it.  We shouldn't assume anything different with the Negative CTC issue.

If you have any questions, let us know.

Best,
Jeff"

		 Subject: Re: Dereg Articles

I've taken the editor's pencil to Dan's draft.  Here's the result:

 Kirk Johnson's September 26th article, Debate on Need for New Power Plants 
Ignores Conservation, leaves readers with the misperception that competitive 
electricity markets discourage conservation.  True customer choice proves 
otherwise.
 My company supplies electricity to a number of businesses in Maine.  One of 
these customers is a  paper mill that uses more electricity than thousands of 
homes.  When New England power prices temporarily spiked last May, we 
actually paid the mill to shut down ... which they were more than happy to 
do.  As a result, the customer made money, the grid worked better, and 
residential customers didn't hear a word about ""brownouts.""
 The financial rewards in the open market create much better incentives to 
conserve than do the bureaucratic, one-size-fits-all programs of the 
regulatory elite.  It's proving true in Maine, why not give New York and 
other states the same choice?

If you like it, send it to the Letters to the Editor section at the New York 
Times.  The protocol is on the editorial page.

Thanks for the quick response,

Subject: Pedersen inquiry

Hey gang,
I've taken the first stab at answering Norm's inquiry... give me your 
thoughts.  Also, Susan, what is the protocol for a case being litigated at 
the CPUC for inquiries like this?  Should we put a disclaimer that the 
information we might provide is protected under Rule 51 or other ""settlement 
discussions only"" protection?



Mr. Pedersen,
First, I'd like to clear-up the nomenclature being used here.  As you know, 
currently SoCalGas doesn't assign ""primary rights"" to deliveries off of any 
interconnecting pipeline.  The establishment of tradeable rights for 
intrastate capacity is among the issues currently under consideration in the 
CPUC proceeding.   However, if what you are asking about is what has been the 
historical or otherwise available receipt capacity for Transwestern 
deliveries at North Needles, then let me offer the following. 

Transwestern has always operated on the premise that SoCalGas could 
physically accept up to a maximum of 750 MMcf/d at its North Needles receipt 
point.  Consequently, Transwestern has sold firm transportation to its 
interstate customers for west flow deliveries to North Needles not to exceed 
the 750 MMcf/d limitation.  Our west flow mainline capacity is 1.09 Bcf/d.  
The 340 MMcf/d difference between the mainline capacity and the physical 
capacity into SoCalGas at North Needles is used to provide firm service at 
our other delivery points at or near the California border, including PG&E, 
Mojave, Southwest Gas, Citizens Utilities, and in the near future, directly 
connected electric generation plants.

That has Fielder and everyone else at Edison scrambling to continue their attempts to stay out of bankruptcy, which means that Fielder won't be focused, and can't focus on, anything else for the next couple of weeks.

Subject:  Swap Agreement




I am sending this e-mail message to address several issues related to the
swap and to circulate a proposed confirmation for your consideration.

Before addressing the swap, however, I should note that it is not clear to
me that the project team has finally decided to proceed with a swap rather
than a guaranty.  If we are not, I would appreciate someone letting me know
so that we can stop this process.

Comments on the Draft Schedule:

     1.  Part 1(a) ""Specified Entity"":  A Specified Entity is an entity
other than the parties whose actions can cause an event of default or a
termination event.  The draft schedule does not contemplate a Specified
Entity.  I think we should consider whether EPE and/or SCG should be a
Specified Entity with respect to TBS.

     2.  Part 1(b) ""Threshold Amount"": proposes $1,000,000 for TBS, which
seems low given that Enron Corp. is backing it up.

     3.  Part 1(h) ""Additional Event of Default"":  If we use a swap
arrangement, there will be two: one for 72.5% between TBS and ECT, and one
for 27.5% between TBS and a Shell entity.  If that is the case, do we want
an additional event of default under which a sale by Shell of its interest
in TBS could result in termination?

     4.  Part 2  ""Representations"":  I think that we need someone in tax
to determine whether TBS can make the representations.

     5.  Part 4(d) & (e) ""Credit Support Provider"": Shell will be the
credit support provider under the other swap arrangement, not this one.

     6.  Part 4(g) ""Governing Law"", 4(h) ""Arbitration"": The schedule
proposes Texas law with AAA arbitration to be held in Texas.  It would seem
to me that we would want to use arbitration procedures that are similar to
those in the gas supply agreements, with ICC arbitration, held in Miami,
under New York, with joint arbitration if the same issue arises under one of
the gas supply arrangements (such as the proper calculation of price).

Comment on the Proposed Confirmation:

     I have reproduced the gas supply pricing provisions from the EPE Gas
Supply Agreement under the ""Fixed Amount Details"" but have not done so under
the ""Floating Amount Details"", which cross-references the provisions of the
SCG Gas Supply Agreement, because of the length of those provisions.

     Please let me know if you have any reactions to the above comments
or any comments on the attached confirmation.  I will contact Nasim to
discuss the process for pushing the swaps (or, alternatively, guaranties) to
completion.

Regards, Dean

Hey lady!

What's up?  I just had the most hectic week of my life!  I had such a great
time with Dad and Laura - is it just me or does he get cooler every time you
see him?  He took me, Nathan, Michelle and Monica out to this awesome
restaurant and totally paid for everyone.  I was so touched, especially
since I think they're kind of trying to watch the funds.  My car is great!
It's so little and perfect.  Then as soon as they left I went on my Outward
Bound weekend, which was incredible.  We went snowshoeing, did a ropes
course, and learned how to use a map and compass (the last thing was SO fun
- I want to buy a compass and carry it around with me everyday).  Anyway,
I'll have to tell you more about it on the phone since it was kind of
complicated, but super fun.  I had SUCH a great time, and I'm even more
convinced that this is the right job for me right now.  Nathan is still good
- I'm installing a toothbrush at his apartment, which I think is a good
sign.  He's great.

So what's going on in your life?  Call me tonight if you get a chance!

Love, yo sista

Is anyone familiar with an ISDA Master Agreement executed between ENA and the 
above company?  I have received a Security Agreement executed by this party 
seeking ENA's signature and the document references the Endorsement (to a 
policy  - what policy?) issued to ENA on 10/19/00 which defines the ISDA 
agreement.  This could be related to credit activity in London.  I am waiting 
to hear from Jeff Kinneman and Denis O'Connell.

Subject: Re: Price Cap Media--DRAFT  

I have a couple of suggestions on parts of the draft.

Media Action:
In addition to doing behind the scenes editorial board meetings and the like, 
I would suggest that we get our coalition lined up and ready to release 
statements for certain key events which are likely to occur over the next 
several weeks, such as:

1.  SDG&E's selection of the winning bid to their RFP.  Even if Enron isn't 
selected as the winning bid, the coalition should trumpet the market-based 
solution and the enormous market response to SDG&E's RFP.
2.  The Commission vote on UCAN's Emergency Motion.  We should be prepared to 
issue a statement whether the Cmmn votes with us or against us.  With us, the 
market can and did provide reasonable, expedient solutions to SDG&E's 
customers and protection from price spikes.  Against us, despite the 
overwhelming market response, the Cmmn chose to ignore the market solutions 
and impose more regulation.
3.  Potential for ARM members to surface a Provider of Last Resort proposal 
within the next couple of weeks.
4.  ISO Bd. Mtg-keep up pressure against reducing price caps.

Coalition Members:

Agree that those groups listed should be contacted, although the CMA, CRA, 
CIU, CLECA have been luke-warm in their advocacy.

I would add our customers (UC/CSU (especially the San Diego branch), PacTel, 
etc.)  NewEnergy has indicated that Kroger/Ralph's grocery stores, San 
Diego-based, would give testimonials.  I could solicit the members of ARM to 
identify a key customer contacts for interviews.  

We could check with our lobbyists and see who they would recommend (wine 
growers, dairy industry, etc.)  We should also consider the water agencies 
and the rural counties and the City of Pittsburg.  While the immediate 
message is responding to San Diego's situation, this latter group of 
potential coalition members would go to the larger message (keeping benefits 
of competitive markets) from a state-wide perspective.  What about the City 
of Pittsburg?

As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

ECT received a default notice from GSI dated December 3, 2001.  The signature is illegible. There is a path in the upper right hand margin which reads ""Draft: (GWN/MJR)

The letter terminates the Prime Brokerage Agreement between ECT and GSI dated ""20 August 2000"".  As you know, our agreement was dated August 24, 2001.  Can you direct this email to the appropriate GSI person for termination of the appropriate agreement?

Subject: Enron Proposed Response - Summary of the SCE Deal

Here are some thoughts on what our message may be.=20

Unclear how this is going to increase supply, decrease demand, and increase=
=20
customer choice.  Still doesn't make sense to us to have the state buy a=20
crumbling transmission network instead of school lunches.

We don't have enough details.  There are several aspects that are interesti=
ng=20
and could use further study.  Governor Davis needs to make the details publ=
ic=20
as soon as possible so people can understand the full implications.  For=20
instance, what happens to DWR contracts?  Will they be assigned to SCE?  Wi=
ll=20
customers have the right to choose going forward?

The recent events highlight the critical need to make sure that customers c=
an=20
make their own energy decisions going forward.  We know that Government=20
doesn't know how to get this right.  The right answer is giving customers=
=20
more choices, not fewer.

Can't endorse it until we know if our bills are going to be paid in full.  =
If=20
the bills aren't paid in full, highly likely that we'll see involuntary=20
bankruptcy.

Too bad that this deal wasn't done earlier.  It could have saved alot of=20
money and pain.

Why do you need to include the transmission purchase in this deal?  May nev=
er=20
happen.  Make it easy - just deal with the under collection through=20
securitization and throught the EIX refund to SCE and get on with it.

Subject: Summary of the MOU

The following is an outline of the basic terms of the Southern California=
=20
Edison Memorandum of Understanding:

? Commitment to Provide Power =01) SCE will keep its current generation pla=
nts=20
and other generation assets and commit them to provide power on a regulated=
=20
cost-of-service basis for 10 years.
? Dedication of Power =01) Edison International will commit the entire outp=
ut of=20
Sunrise (one of Edison International=01,s non-regulated generating faciliti=
es)=20
to the State on a fixed price basis for 10 years. Phase I of Sunrise is to =
be=20
brought online by August 15, 2001. If not brought online by August 15, 2001=
,=20
Edison International shall be assessed a $2 million penalty.
? Transmission Sale =01) SCE will sell to the State its transmission assets=
 for=20
approximately $2.76 billion (2.3 times the net book value of the assets),=
=20
subject to certain adjustments. Of the $2.76 billion, the $1.5 billion gain=
=20
on sale, will be used to reduce SCE=01,s net undercollected amount as of Ja=
nuary=20
31, 2001. In connection with the purchase, the State will also assume certa=
in=20
liabilities associated with the transmission assets.
? Backup Transaction =01) If the transmission sale does not occur within tw=
o=20
years for reasons beyond the parties=01, control, then if the State elects,=
 SCE=20
shall sell to the State SCE=01,s hydro generation assets. If the hydro asse=
ts=20
are not worth $1.5 billion, then SCE will also sell the state after Decembe=
r=20
31, 2010 enough below-market-price-power to make up the shortfall.
? Conservation Property =01) SCE shall grant perpetual conservation easemen=
ts to=20
the State covering approximately 260,000 acres of its Big Creek hydroelectr=
ic=20
related lands and 825 acres of its Eastern Sierra hydroelectric related=20
lands.  Some of the land may be deeded in fee.
? Contribution by Edison International =01) Edison International will refun=
d to=20
SCE not less than $400 million.  This money will consist of a refund of=20
approximately $293 million in estimated 2000 quarterly tax payments plus=20
approximately $197 million in federal loss carryback tax savings.
? Investment =01) Edison International and SCE will invest not less than $3=
=20
billion over the next 5 years in capital improvements for SCE.
? Litigation =01) SCE shall dismiss certain claims, including its takings a=
nd=20
filed rate doctrine cases.
? CPUC Regulation =01) CPUC shall continue to regulate SCE using historical=
=20
principles of ratemaking.
? Payment for Portion of QF Drop-off =01) SCE shall pay an amount that=20
represents that portion of the net short from January 18, 2001 to April 1,=
=20
2001 that is attributable to QF=01,s not selling to SCE (due to SCE=01,s fa=
ilure to=20
pay the QF=01,s).  SCE will securitize this amount.
? Securitization =01) SCE shall securitize its full net undercollected amou=
nt=20
(approx. $3.5 billion).  The securitization shall occur in two tranches (i.=
e.=20
two different nonbypassable dedicated rate components).

? The first tranche will occur after the passage of legislation and the=20
signing of the definitive agreements and will cover the net undercollected=
=20
amount, less the gain on sale, plus interest on certain obligations in the=
=20
net undercollected amount.
? The second tranche would be triggered if the transmission sale does not=
=20
occur within two years.  Accordingly, the second tranche would not show up =
in=20
rates for two years, if at all.

? Buying the Net Short =01) The State will be required to buy the net short=
=20
through December 31, 2002.  After 2002 SCE will be responsible for covering=
=20
the net short.
? Investment Recovery =01) SCE shall have an authorized rate of return that=
 will=20
not drop below its current rte (11.6%) during the 10 year cost of service=
=20
ratemaking period.
? Next Steps (Definitive Agreements and CPUC Action):

? Definitive Agreements =01) Once the MOU is signed, the next stage is to=
=20
negotiate definitive agreements which contain the specific terms of the=20
transmission sale, as well as the specific terms of the various other relat=
ed=20
agreements (e.g., the O&M Agreement, Transmission Services Agreement and th=
e=20
Facilities Services Agreement).
? CPUC Action =01) Prior to entering into the definitive agreements, the CP=
UC=20
must undertake certain actions (which include: establishing mechanisms for=
=20
preapproval of procurement costs and URG costs, deferring SCE=01,s general =
rate=20
case until 2003, granting SCE some relief from direct access credits and=20
clarifying the first priority condition in the holding company act).

I am just now getting started with work. John met me at the door the first
thing and we talked for almost an hour and a half about a new game plan he
wanted to get my thoughts on. If it hadn't been for my training seminar at 9
I don't know how long we would have talked.

The school nurse called and asked that we keep a watch on Michael for pink
eye. He was taken to see the nurse because his left eye was red. He first
told Norris he rubbed it. Then he said he poked himself in the eye. The
nurse says she doesn't think he has it but there is a case of pink eye in
the class. She said when she asked the teacher if she should call me Michael
said absolutely! She said he was fine and there was no reason to pick him up
early.

Vince and Stinson,

I have Mr. Chen's resume here who has strong background fitting into our 
needs.
He has a Ph.D. in Geophysics from MIT and a MS finance from UH.    Do you 
want to set up a time to talk to him ?

He is currently in IT group reporting to Tom Moore. I got to know him because 
he was
working on option models in ERMS system. He is already familar with many our 
models.
Sounds like he is determinded to move to financial modeling area.

"Gregg,

Sheila was telling me that Enron has an ISDA agreement with Peoples, and 
there's some guaranty language there, also.  I'll try to track this down.

This is a very rough draft based on an agreement done previously with a jv 
company.  I'm sending it for Enron review only, since I haven't even read the 
entire thing yet.  I thought you might want to take a look at it to see what 
you think, and to consider the scope of the services to be provided.

As for legal services, one alternative would be to have the services provided 
by an outside law firm, not associated with either principal.

Could you forward me what you received from Clement regarding the corporate 
guaranty issue?  I would like to see what's the latest in that regard.

Thanks,

Hi Vince,

I was wondering how the chapter of the book is coming along??! Do you want  me
to make 'noise' tomorrow or to leave you until after Easter?

Until then, I wanted to discuss with you an idea  that Les and I have been
throwing around concerning writing a series of articles  for Risk's 'Energy 
and
Power Risk Management'. We would like to propose to  them?that we would write 
an
article a month, covering practical issues  dealing with energy modelling and
energy derivative pricing and risk management.  The articles would be based 
upon
sections of the book so as to promote the book,  and to reduce the effort/time
involved by using?already produced material.  We would like to cover some very
practical topics, but we?won't be giving  too much away as the articles are 
only
1 or 2 pages long.

Each article would be of?the  form;

- introduce?the concept
- give an example using real data
- discuss the problem with a case study
- provide a discussion
- sum up

I've included a list of potential articles at the  end of this e-mail. For
example, for the first one,  ""Estimation of mean reversion in spot energy
prices"", we would introduce  the concept of mean reversion,?show a graph of an
equity index and an  energy price?for illustration of our point, estimate the
parameter for a  series of energies over a number of seasons, and finally,
discuss the  results.

We?are wondering if you would like to be  involved in this project? Your
involvement needn't take much time (although it  is up to you). The kind of
input we are hoping for (again, this is up to you) is  that you?would?review 
the
list of articles and  provide?suggestions of additions or deletions, suggest
reasonable data sets  or case studies to work with on each article, and then 
to
run your eye over  ""near finished"" articles, which?we would supply to you for
your?practical experience?input.? Would something like this  interest you? If 
it
did, we would try to sell Risk on making it a regular  monthly ""feature"" of
EPRM, authored by all three of us.

We are hoping to present our proposal to Risk in  the next few weeks, so 
please
let us know if you are interested.

Best regards.

Chris.


Potental EPRM articles;

1- Estimation of mean reversion in spot energy  prices (with parameters
estimated for oil, gas, and electricity data over  different seasons)

2- Estimation of jumps in spot energy prices (with  parameters estimated for
oil, gas, and electricity data over different  seasons)

3- Simulating a mean reverting spot price process  for pricing energy
derivatives (with case study applied to an Asian option on  oil)

4- Simulating a jump / diffusion spot price process  for pricing energy
derivatives (with case study applied to a Swaption on natural  gas)

5- Simulating a mean reverting jump / diffusion  spot price process for 
pricing
energy derivatives (with case study applied to  hourly caps on spot 
electricity)

6- An analytical pricing formula for pricing caps  in a mean reverting spot
price model (with example applied to a cap on natural  gas fitting the Forward
curve and volatlity structure)

7- using a tree consistent with the forward curve  and vols for pricing swing
options

8- implying a single?factor vol function from  market Futures option prices 
and
variation of parameters thru time

9- adding jump volatility to the tree

10- An analytical pricing formula for pricing caps  in a multi-factor forward
curve model(with example applied to the same cap on  natural gas and a
discussion on the differences between the two  approaches)

11- Estimating volatility functions for  multi-factor forward curve models 
(with
estimates of oil data over different  periods)

12- Estimating volatility functions for  multi-factor forward curve model from
market option prices

13- pricing swing option in multi factor model  using tree for exercise 
strategy

14- comparison of VaR methodoligies applied to the  same energy derivativ
portfolio.

"Too hot a market: How energy producers manipulate California 


(Published Sept. 22, 2000) 
The priciest place to shop this August in California was in Pasadena. There 
at the California Power Exchange, where much of the state's electricity is 
bought and sold, prices that utilities paid for power (an average $166 per 
megawatt) were up fivefold from the previous August ($32). What is happening? 
Among other things, too much power on hot days is being purchased in the 
near-panic environment that develops in the hours before a possible crisis. 
Too little is being purchased as it should be -- days, or even months, in 
advance. 
How was this new market-based system of buying electricity supposed to work? 
Much of the action was supposed to take place at the Power Exchange. There 
vibrant trading was supposed to exist in a variety of markets. Some utilities 
would be busy shopping for electricity the next day. Others, depending on 
their needs, would be squirreling away supply a month, even a year, in 
advance. 
Selling this power are private companies that have been busy purchasing 
fossil-fuel burning generators from the state's investor-owned utilities. 
Under the state's restructuring of electricity, these utilities were 
obligated to sell their fossil-fuel burning plants, but not necessarily their 
nuclear or hydroelectric generators. 
On any given day, up to 95 percent of the power needed to fuel California was 
supposed to be already purchased. The idea was to leave just a little bit for 
the last minute. Headquartered in Folsom, the state's entire grid is managed 
by an agency known as the Independent System Operator. The ISO's job is to 
buy whatever extra power is necessary to keep the lights on. With literally 
only hours to work with, the ISO is ill-suited to drive hard bargains. The 
ISO pays up to $250 per megawatt. 
The problem is that the ISO's spot market is way too big, and too pricey. It 
is buying up to 30 percent of California's power on some days, particularly 
hot ones. This August, less power is being purchased in those struggling 
futures market down in Pasadena. More was being bought in Folsom. This is a 
telltale sign that California's electricity market is working for those who 
own power plants, not those who pay the bills that are poised to rise.

I believe that you agreed at our last meeting that it might be well for you 
and me -- and Ken if available -- to discuss plans for this group in 2001. My 
feeling is that we should review its composition after the election -- we may 
lose Larry or want to add a Democrat (Laura Tyson?); we can take a hard look 
at who is contributing and who isn't etc.
My agenda would be:
1. What can be done to increase the value to Enron? As I see it we have two 
purposes: to create fans of and spokepersons for the company in important 
fora, and to enrich management's understanding of the outside world (what it 
is like, and how it views some of the problems that Enron faces).
2. What are the likely topics that it would be valuable for Enron to discuss 
in 2001, as best we can judge things at this early point in time? 
3. What should the composition of the group consist of in 2001, given 
whatever we decide in #1 and #2 above.
4. How can we maximize the chance of achieving Ken's objective of attracting 
outside guest speakers? Advance scheduling? Fees? And what sorts would we 
like to attract?
I am sure there are many other items; these are designed merely to start you 
thinking.
Let me start the bidding by suggesting November 29 or December 4, inn 
Washington if you happen to be in town, in Houston if that is more convenient.

"
"We met with the commercial team this afternoon and I was able to piece 
together the following:

Access to the auction site will be by clicking on a button on the EnronOnline 
(note spelling) trading page.

Most users of the site will already be signed up for EnronOnline - both a PA 
and ETA executed.

Other users will be given a user ID and password that give them ""guest"" 
access to EnronOnline and trading access to the auction page.

On the auction page the users may submit their offers to transact (either to 
buy or sell) with Enron.  The page will list a reserve price and identify the 
number of credits to be auctioned.  We are willing to commit to transact up 
to that number with the best bidders (at or beyond the reserve  price) but 
may transact larger volumes if we choose.

Users' offers may be submitted at any time during the auction period (this 
time frame remains a bit unclear - probably one day, possibly a week or more) 
and must remain binding until the close of the bidding and determination of 
winning bidders.

Certain uncreditworthy users may be required to post a deposit in the full 
amount of their offer to buy.

It is not yet clear if we will publish the offers after the fact (maybe just 
the winning offers - all without names of course) or even during the auction 
period but we would like to have that option.

I'm sure I've missed a few points but that gives you the flavor.  Harry is 
preparing the ""GTC"" for the actual purchases and sales - I assume based on 
our standard contracts for these products.  We need to put the legal 
framework together for the rest of it.  If the existing PA and ETA are 
adequate, that would be great but I haven't reread them with that in mind.  
We REALLY don't want to have to have existing users sign another piece of 
paper.  It makes sense that the existing ETA covers some territory that won't 
matter to users who only have access to the auction page (e.g. references to 
master agreements) so a stripped down version of the ETA for those 
counterparties would make sense.  

Can we talk on Monday?"

Subject: FERC Order on Morgan Stanley Complaint Against ISO


We have good news on the ISO price caps front.  The FERC has made it
clear that ISO does not have the ability to mandate that generators sell to 
ISO at its price caps and that the proper response to inadequate supply is to 
lift the price caps.

On Friday, the FERC issued its Order on Complaint in connection with the July 
10 complaint filed by Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc. (""MS"").  As you may 
recall, MS requested FERC to issue a stay of the ISO's maximum purchase price 
authority and to direct the ISO to reverse any price cap reductions.  MS 
sought Fast Track processing pursuant to Rule 206(h), which was granted by 
FERC on the grounds that the complaint ""warrants expeditious action.""

As a quick background summary for you, last November, FERC issued an order 
approving Tariff Amendment 21 which extended ISO's price cap authority 
through 11/15/00.  That order stated that the ISO ""maximum purchase price was 
not a cap on what the seller may charge the ISO, but a cap on what the ISO 
was willing to pay.""  The Commission said that sellers dissatisfied with the 
price cap could ""choose to sell those services into the California Power 
Exchange or bilateral markets.""

FERC notes in Friday's Order that the 6/28 the ISO's Board resolution lowered 
the caps to $500 and ISO further directed that, ""To the extent permitted by 
law, regulation and pre-existing contract, Management shall direct generators 
to bid in all their capacity when system load exceeds 38,000 MW.""

The MS complaint alleged that the cap reduction was unlawful and would, 
""threaten the stability and integroty of the marketplace.""  MS also requested 
an emergency technical conference to examine ISO's justification for the 
price cap reduction.

FERC denied the MS stay request, as well as its request that the $750 maximum 
purchase price be reinstated.  The Commission reiterates that it is not 
approving a cap on sellers' prices, because they can sell at whatever price 
they want.  Rather ISO has simply stated the maximum price it is willing to 
pay.  ""Because sellers are not required to sell to the ISO, the ISO cannot 
dictate their price.""

Importantly, however, FERC also states that, ""ISO has no more or less ability 
to procure capacity and energy than any other buyer of these services....if 
the ISO is unable to elicit sufficient supplies at or below its announced 
purchase price ceiling (because generators are free to sell elsewhere if they 
choose), it will have to raise its purchase price to the level necessary to 
meet its needs.""  [Emphasis added]  FERC then notes that this may lead to an 
increase in Out of Market (""OOM"") calls and that OOM calls are not subject to 
a maximum purchase price.

Also, with regard to the ISO's resolution stating that generators must bid 
their capacity into the ISO markets when system load exceeds 38,000 MW, FERC 
states clearly that, ""such a requirement is not permitted by our November  12 
Order and the ISO tariff.""  [Emphasis added]

FERC goes on to say that any requirement to sell to ISO in conjunction with a 
maximum purchase price would require significant revisions to ISO's market 
rules, which could not be made effective without a corresponding amendment to 
ISO's tariff.  This would require 60 days' advance notice, ""and could not be 
implemented prior to Commission approval.  As stated above, our November 12 
Order was clearly based on the premise that the proper response to inadequate 
supply (due to a low maximum purchase price) is to raise the maximum purchase 
price.""

ISO is then ""put on notice that any amendment to mandate sales must be 
accompanied by a demonstration that this extreme measure is the proper 
response to low supplies in the ISO markets.""

Concurrences were filed by Commissioners Massey and Hebert.  Massey suggests 
that the state has to facilitate solutions to market issues, such as risk 
management tools, removing constraints on hedging opportunities, introducing 
real time pricing through real time metering and expediting approval of new 
generation and transmission projects in California.  Hebert says that the 
previous November Order tried to ""straddle the fence"" and that, ""Today, the 
Commission at least starts to lean slightly in the right direction of 
recognizing that we have a role.""  He then reiterates his preference for 
removing all price caps.  He also suggests that, ""Getting to the bottom of 
the problem, in my view, requires us to begin a proceeding to rescind our 
approval of the ISO as operator of the California grid.  The record supports 
such a move.""  He refers approvingly to the Collins resignation letter, 
stating that it, ""thoughtfully outlines consequences to the market of a 
return to 'command and control.' ""  Hebert states that, ""The independence of 
the ISO's governing structure stands threatened.  We should 'stand up,' to 
quote the resignation letter.""  Hebert advocates opening a section 206 
proceeding now, as part of the recently announced inquiry into bulk power 
markets, ""including the California markets.""

This decision makes it clear that ISO cannot lower the caps at tomorrow's 
meeting and expect that sellers will be required to sell to it at that 
price.  This is an important development and very good news in our ongoing 
efforts to seek economic sanity at the ISO.

Please call if you have any questions.

Kathleen,

I have spoken with Mr. Greene's attorney - Ed Legner - and let him know that 
his minor suggested changes for the one year extension of the Pontiac site 
option were acceptable.  I indicated that we would send out originals for 
review and execution this week.

The procedure we agreed to was as follows:

We will send originals to Ed Legner in Pontiac for his review and initials.
He will forward to Dick Greene in Florida for execution.
Dick will sign and send to us
We execute and return their original along with the the two checks in the 
amount of $5000 each - one for exercise of the six month extension, and the 
other for making our requested changes for turbopark compliance and for 
granting an additional 12 month extension option at the end of this year.

I would like to get this inked as soon as possible in order to ensure the 
viability of the Pontiac site for a 2003 COD.

Vince,

Good to hear from you and I'm glad you're available. How is Wednesday at
2:30?

I did look at EOL and am not surprised to see its quality. I was unable to
say much about it in my Risk Electricity Hedging and Trading report because
of deadline pressures. How is the site doing? I am intrigued by the
competition for trading platforms and was astonished to hear that Goldman,
Morgan, BP and Shell were going to launch a site to compete with yours. Talk
about a shotgun marriage!

If we have time next week, I could step you through our website --
www.weathereffects.com. I'm very proud of what we've done. I can't give out
a password yet but would be happy to walk through the site with you over the
phone using my password. It's a very ambitious site -- with state-of-the-art
WSI weather (seasonal, 6-10, and day to day) driving a good load model for
PJM and NEPOOL. ESAI contributes oil and gas input price forecasts, capacity
judgments, and ""herding"" ideas to develop power price forecasts for same
time periods. After one month's full-bore effort, I'm pleased with the
results (e.g., we forecast Nepool onpeak to be $43 and it turned out $46).

Have a great weekend.

Ed

I'm glad you liked it.  My next ""Enron"" task is to try and develop a better
understanding of the way you describe the use of BTU swaps to create a
synthethic multi-fuel plant.  I understand the basic concept but want to
learn more about the swaps (duration, cost, etc) which will impact a
company's decision to build a single vs multi-fuel generator.  Do you have
some example transactions or analyses that I might look over to learn more?

See ya in April (we're going to learn to ""rope"" calves this year).

term of the Transaction will be a Determination Period. The Notional Quantity 
per Determination Period is the volume submitted multiplied by the number 
days in the relevant Determination Period.  The Payment Date(s) will be 5 
business days after the Floating Price is determinable. The Floating Price 
shall be the average of the Index for each day in the relevant Determination 
Period.
The term of the Transaction shall be from the Effective Date to the

   draft will be 11-12 ish but where?  dan has volunteered his house
   (pearland)...we can do it at mine (katy)...or anywhere else that might
   be more centrally located?
   jody has shown interest for years and even held the draft at his place
   a few years back (the infamous pool basketball tournament...and the
   black
   eyes which resulted from it....and let's not forget the HAWK/rotweiller
   -C
    URBY/warlock doberman showdown).  i say we give him the first
   opportunity.

   jody,
   once we figure who has designated a franchise player then the remaining
   teams without one have what we call a supplemental draft....basically a
   catch up round.  there is one catch for those who pick franchise
   players....
   when we draw numbers for the 1st ""official"" round they pick at the
   bottom
   because they have the best players in hand.

   sorry if i'm being the brother at arms but we need to finalize asap.
   the
   cost
   is $225????  someone please confirm.   jody, john szallai is back in
   town
   and wants in on the action and i will share a team with him if necessary
   or you can???  we also vote at every draft what upcoming changes we
   desire for the following year.

   there.  Dan's e-mail is bouncing back - so Ty try and get in touch with

   and Jody if need be.

   I'm assuming that the franchise player issue for next year will be voted
   on
   at the draft, as usual.  Kiske, a motion to eliminate Tight Ends?

   Current status quo - franchise players were voted on at last year's
   draft
   and will be allowed for this season, but we will be voting on whether or
   not
   to eliminate them for upcoming seasons.

   Everyone comfortable with announcing your franchise player by August 31?

   I'll designate my franchise player as Edgerrin James.
   I vote for September 8th as well,  11 or 12 is fine with me.

   I sent an E-mail to Deluke and others and was told that the agreed upon
   date
   was Sept 8...mainly due to the previous weekend being Labor Day.  I
   would
   prefer our usual start time around 11 or 12.  I have somewhere else to
   be
   around 5pm or so.  We also agreed to divulge franchise players and
   determine
   draft order the day of the draft.  If anyone has issues...then speak
   now.

   Later,

Subject: People to consider recruiting

As requested, I've created a list of people who:
have mentioned to me that they are interested in changing careers/companies or
I think would be a great asset to Enron.

I've jotted down what I know about each person and I hope you find it 
useful.  I've organized it from most experienced to least experienced.  If 
you would like to talk me about any of these people or ask me to contact 
them, just let me know.

Andy Dunn - until 2 weeks ago he was a director in the PwC risk management 
practice.  Due to a falling out between Andy and the partners (not client 
related), he left the firm.  He is extremely well respected by both the audit 
and the non-audit personnel, and his leaving came as an unexpected surprise.  
I have worked with him on a number of occasions and would highly recommend 
him to Enron.  The downside to Andy is that he lives in Denver, is used to 
travelling a lot, but, at the last time we spoke (a few months ago), is not 
interested in leaving Denver.  His cell phone (if still in use) is 303 807 
0040.

Mark (Allan) Smith - Mark is in the PwC energy risk management practice in 
Houston.  We worked very closely together throughout 1999 on projects for 
Coral Energy and Equiva trading.  Prior to working at PwC, Mark was at BP for 
15 years where he had many different roles (he worked as a crude trader, 
products trader, he worked in the risk management department, in the refinery 
itself as an engineer).  Mark was excellent to work with.  Clients are 
extremely impressed with his knowledge and background.  I would highly 
recommend him for a leadership role at Enron.  I spoke to him yesterday and 
he is interested in talking with you.  His direct number is 713 356 4233.  
His cell phone number is 713 412 3890.

Alan Beaton - senior manager KPMG's systems control group (IRM).  He works 
with my husband.  I know him on a personal basis.  He is trying to find 
opportunities outside of the audit/consulting area (general line 713 319 
2000).

Marilyn Chee - She currently works for Equiva trading, manager in-charge of 
accounting for derivatives.  Her role has expanded to encompass FAS 133 and 
all mtm accounting entries.  She liases with all book heads (crude and all 
products).  In the past, she worked in the Texaco internal audit department.  
She was my main contact at Equiva when I was at PwC.  She is extremely 
diligent and very professional.  I enjoyed working with her greatly and have 
to say she was one of the best people I have worked with in the capacity of a 
client/professional relationship.    Marilyn has a lot of responsibilities at 
the alliance and is extremely well respected.  She has had a difficult year 
as she is doing a job that should be done by 3+ people.  She has mentioned to 
me that she is not happy about the fact that her load continues to increase, 
and has even mentioned finding another job.  However, due to the fact that 
she is so well respected where she is, she may be difficult to recruit (713 
277 6280).  If you contact her I would not want my name associated with it 
due to the PwC/alliance relationship.

Rebecca Crider - She has been working at Coral Energy for approximately a 
year, reporting to the VP of risk control.  Before that she was an audit 
manager at AA.  I have worked with her briefly and she seemed very 
conscientious.  I do not know if she is looking or not, but its worth a try! 
(713 230 3000 general line).

Kim Nelson - She is a manager in the risk group at AA, and just transferred 
over from KPMG.  I have not met her, but I did hear that she is not doing 
what she had expected at AA.  I don't know her number but you could reach her 
at the general AA line.

Kevin Schroder - audit manager at KPMG in the energy department.  I do not 
know him, but do know he is looking for opportunities outside the 
audit/consulting area (general line 713 319 2000).

Keith Considine - He is currently a senior accountant at PwC.  He is the best 
senior PwC Houston has, as well as probably one of the best people I have 
ever worked with (the top of his class).  Although he only has 4 years of 
work experience (all at PwC), he performs in a manager capacity.  He worked 
for me on the Coral Energy audit engagement and received an excellent 
evaluation from both myself and the partners (we all agreed that he is one of 
the best people any of us have seen or worked with).  He is currently working 
on a project at one of PwC's clients to standardize their mid office 
processes .  He definitely does not see himself as a long time employee of 
PwC, but is currently planning on staying there until he is promoted to 
manager.  I actually recommended him for a promotion to manager at July 1 
this year, but due to capacity issues, I don't expect that the promotion will 
be approved. Since I've only been with Enron a short time and would like to 
continue good relations with PwC, I would appreciate whoever contacts Keith 
to elude that it is someone else other than myself who gave you his name. His 
number is 713 356 5617.

Dave Simpson - analyst at Koch Energy in Houston, has a degree in accounting 
and has work experience of about 9 months.  He is very interested in leaving 
Koch.  I know him on a person basis, but have not worked with him.  He is a 
good guy and very likeable.  I don't have his phone number, but should be 
reachable through the general number for Koch.

Admin assistants

Connie Shugart - she is currently working at PwC as an administrative 
assistant.  She is also involved in recruiting experienced personnel for 
PwC's audit and internal audit service lines.  She is very interested in 
Enron and has asked me a few times to get her a contact here.  I have not 
worked directly with her but due to her close proximity to my office I talked 
to her a number of times and was very impressed. (713 356 4000 - general PwC 
number).

Ellen Robertson - She is an administrative assistant who is looking to leave 
PwC.   I have never worked with her, but she did come to ask me my opinion on 
how she should go about finding other work. (713 356 4000 PwC general line).

"Dear Gang:
I don't know about you folks, but I woke up to over 100 emails from Telecom 
Reports today.  It seems to border on spam at this point.  Is anyone else 
having this experience?  The info is very valuable, but I'm wondering if 
there's a way to get, say, 3 emails a day rather than the 50 or more I'm 
currently receiving.

Wondering if the lights will stay on today,

USA: Senators renew high-speed Internet tax credit bill. 
  
01/23/2001 
Reuters English News Service 
(C) Reuters Limited 2001. 
WASHINGTON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - A bill that would encourage businesses to 
bring high-speed Internet access to underserved areas was reintroduced in the 
Senate on Tuesday, with the hopes that President Bush would include the item 
in his budget.
Computers equipped with a ""broadband"" or high-speed Internet connection can 
download information at a rate of up to 1.5 megabits per second, or about 25 
times faster than a standard, dial-up connection. While broadband access is 
currently available in many business districts and affluent residential 
neighborhoods, the service has not yet spread to less affluent or more 
sparsely populated areas. 
The bill would provide a five-year, 10 percent tax credit to Internet 
companies that extend broadband service to rural or underserved urban areas.
Companies who build ""next generation"" networks, with download speeds of up to 
22 megabits per second, would receive a 20 percent, five-year credit.
The bill was introduced by Republican senators Olympia Snowe of Maine and 
Orrin Hatch of Utah, and Democrats Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia and John 
Kerry of Massachusetts. It was co-sponsored by 32 other senators.
The 36 senators sent a letter to President Bush urging him to include the 
bill in his initial budget proposal.
The bill attracted the support of 59 senators and 115 House members last 
year, the letter claimed.

"Ryan,

In the follow up to the meeting we had on Wednesday I would like
to reinforce one point I made. I feel strongly that I cannot support
the valuations my group has produced so far for the LJM/Raptor
related transactions without examination of all the related legal documents.

I feel that we did solid work based on verbal information,  but I cannot
guarantee the quality of the final product without looking at the contracts.
These transactions are too complex and controversial to bypass due diligence requirements 
that you would expect from any professional.

"Does it make sense to have a quick call (15-30 minutes) just to update you on the status of Edison/PG&E talks, what's going on at the PUC, etc.?  Let me know.  Today looks pretty good for me to try to do it.

This looks like we are going to be in a long pissing match with Edison.  It would be very helpful to know what our position is with DA customers before Cal Push 1 and Cal Push 2 going forward.  I know that this is probably a pain, but it seems like that's information that we need to know.  Also, it appears that Edison is under the opinion that we were short a call option to them during the ctc recovery period.  Edison gets to keep positive ctc's while they get to recover negative ctc's from esp's.

jeff d., what does edison say to the point that they got to keep positive ctc's and are now attempting to amortize negative ctc's?

Subject:	Update:  Meeting w/Edison RE: recovery of Negative CTC Claim

?	We met with Edison yesterday in the attempt to settle our negative CTC claim.
?	Edison continues to take a very hard-line, extreme position.  This is it in a nutshell:
1.	all customers--bundled and DA alike--""contributed to Edison's undercollection"" and all customers must pay it down; 
2.	bundled customers contributed through frozen rates and DA customers contributed through the negative CTC;
3.	Edison says it will pay ESPs past due amounts related to the negative CTC, but it intends to then turn around and assess a charge on all customer bills--DA and bundled alike--to recover its undercollection. 
4.	Edison intends to collect it over approximately 2 years.  Edison estimates that the charge to DA customers over this period would be about $25-27/MWH.
5.	Under Edison's plan, Enron would likely end up paying Edison, i.e., the present value of the ""undercollection"" charge would exceed the present value of the lump sum negative CTC payment.
?	Obviously, with respect to any settlement with Edison, we're extremely far apart and we're therefore considering other 	options.
?	In the meantime, the California PUC is engaged in DA and PX credit-related activities beginning next week and Edison 	will try to get the Commission to adopt their proposal.
?	We are working with other market participants and gearing up to vigorously oppose Edison's proposal at the PUC.
?	We will distribute something on Monday describing our approach and tactics at the PUC for folks to review and 	comment on.
?	We are scheduled to meet with Edison again next Thursday to try to knock some sense into them (the probability of 	which is low).

If you have any questions, let us know.

Best,
Jeff"

"Larry Gagliardi has been talking to Valero Marketing and Supply Company about 
doing some gas crack business, and it appears Valero  will not trade with us 
under the current form of Master Swap Agreement we have in place with them.  
They will only trade under their form of ISDA Master, a copy of which is 
attached below.  I spoke to their lawyer, Kim Bowers, who is very nice, and 
she asked us to make our comments to their form by email.   After talking to 
Tanya while you were out, it appears that we need to revisit their credit 
situation since the credit under our existing master swap is quite old.  We 
will try to work on reviewing the legal terms while we wait to get the credit.

Thanks for your call this morning.  I was in the middle of legging some gas
cracks and had to go.

Before we begin trading with you, we need to execute an ISDA.  I am
attaching a copy of our standard schedule.  We have this agreement in place
with all of the major dealers; and so, in general, we will not accept
substantial changes to the agreement, particularly with regard to credit
terms.

Again,  thanks for your call, and I look forward to dealing with you in the
future.

I've added the concept of a date certain for the delivery.  I'm referring to 
these as ""Equipment"" and part of the ""Units"" so it is clear that the

Subject: Carlos Sole

Barbara and Peggy,

I understand that we may be looking for someone to provide some assistance on 
the Mexico transactions, and that Carlos Sole may be interviewing for the 
position.  Carlos and I worked together on multiple transactions in Mexico 
while I was with EECC.  In fact, I hired Carlos to work with me because 90% 
of what I was doing was in  Mexico, and Carlos has a good background in 
transactional work in Mexico. He assumed ""first chair"" responsibility for all 
the Mexico work when I left EECC. Carlos is bilingual in Spanish, and he 
conducts business in Spanish quite comfortably.  He is a very bright, a hard 
worker, and a lot of fun to work with.  I personally think he would be an 
excellent addition to our group.

Please let me know if I can provide any more information about Carlos.  

Kay

 LET'S MAKE SOME COOKIES!!!

THIS IS A TRUE STORY

A little background: Neiman-Marcus, if you
 don't know already is a very
expensive store i.e. they sell your typical
 $8.00 t-shirt for $50.00.Lets let them have it!!!
My daughter and I had just finished a salad
at a Neiman-Marcus Cafe
 in Dallas and decided to have a small dessert. Because
 both of us are such
 cookie lovers, we decided to try the ""Neiman-Marcus
Cookie."" It was so excellent
 that I asked if they would give me the recipe
 and the waitress said with a
small frown, ""I'm afraid not but, you can buy
 the recipe.""

 Well, I asked how much, and she responded,
""Only two fifty, it's a great deal!"" I agreed with approval, just add it to
 my tab I told her. Thirty days later, I received my VISA statement and it was
 $285.00. I looked again and
 I remembered I had only spent $9.95 for two salads and about $20.00
 for a scarf. As I glanced at the bottom of the
 statement, it said, Cookie Recipe -$250.00"" That was outrageous!

I called Neiman's Accounting Dept. and told them the waitress said it
 was ""two-fifty,"" which clearly does not mean ""twohundred and fifty dollars""
by any *POSSIBLE* interpretation of the phrase.= Neiman-Marcus
 refused to budge.They would not refund my money, because
 according to them, ""What the
 waitress told you is not our problem. You have already seen the
 recipe. We absolutely will not refund you money at this point.""

 I explained to her the criminal statues which
 govern fraud in Texas. I threatened to refer them to The Better
 Business Bureau and the State Attorney General Office for engaging in fraud.
I was basically told,""Do what you want, it doesn't matter, we're not refunding
 your money."" I waited, thinking of how I could get even, or even try and get 
any
 of my money back.
 I just said, ""Okay, you folks got my $250, and now I'm going to have
 $250.00 worth of fun.""
 I told her that I was going to see to it that every Cookie lover in
the United States with an e-mail account has a $250.00 cookie recipe from
 Neiman-Marcus...for free. She replied, ""I wish you wouldn't do this."" I
said, ""Well, you should have thought of that before you ripped me off,"" and
 slammed down the phone on her.

So here it is!!! Please, please, please pass it on to everyone youcan
 possibly think of. I paid $250 for this...I don't want Neiman-Marcus
to *ever* get another penny off of this recipe....

 NEIMAN MARCUS COOKIES (Recipe may be halved)
2 cups butter
 4 cups flour
2 tsp. soda
 2 cups sugar
 5 cups blended oatmeal ***
24 oz. chocolate chips
 2 cups brown sugar
 1 tsp. salt
 4 eggs
1 - 8 oz. Hershey Bar (grated
 2 tsp. baking powder
 2 tsp. vanilla
3 cups chopped nuts (your choice)

* Measure oatmeal and blend in a blender to a fine powder.
 * Cream the butter and both sugars.
 * Add eggs and vanilla, mix together with flour, oatmeal, salt, baking 
powder, and soda.
 * Add chocolate chips, Hershey Bar and nuts.

 Roll into balls and place two inches apart on
 a cookie sheet.
* Bake for 10 minutes at 375 degrees.
 * Makes 112 cookies.

 PLEASE READ IT AND SEND TO EVERY PERSON YOU
KNOW WHO HAS AN E-MAIL
ADDRESS!
 THIS IS REALLY TERRIFIC!

 Have fun!!! This is not a joke-this is a true
story. Ride free,
 citizens

required, if they don't know already.  As I mentioned in my email, there 
needs to be a definitive decision made as to whether the change order should 
be funded out of WestLB (prior to December 15) or will be funded through

I faxed change order #2 to Al so that he has the form.  If this will be

Wow, I didn't know I could control anything!  

Change order 2 was initialled by Dale and signed by Chris on November 2, re 
stack extensions.  I also have a hand marked up change order form from Ed 
Danhaus referring to brush power system stabilizers.  Is this what you are 
looking for?

The procedure has been that the project team/attorney prepares the draft of 
the change order (or has EECC do it), I give it a sanity check and arrange 
for signature from GE.

The issue now would be whether this change order should be processed in the 
next week, or be a change to the break out contract.  I do not believe the 
cost has been included in the payment schedule.

Please give me a call if you would like to discuss this.

effective Jan 27 and terminating the  MOPA by selecting an Early Termination  
Date ( which date may be no earlier than 10 Business Days after delivery of 
notice)

Feb 4 - Control Area - File complaint  relating to TVA's actions against 
EPMI's control areas, which lawsuit would be filed in the Eastern District of 
Tenn. (Judge  Edgar) as part of the already filed lawsuit on the interface 
issues

If you have any questions or concerns with this schedule, please notify me 
immediately.  

Unless there are any objections, we will proceed on this basis; provided, 
however, if we hear from Mike Miller that the target operations date of Jan 
24th can not be met, we would then propose to expedite this schedule.  If we 
move up any of these actions, we will notify everybody,

Hi Lori,

I believe we are still pulling our Local Production from you behind NYSEG,
please let me know ASAP if you disagree.

I am going to pull    1620 dth's/day  , again, let me know if this creates a
problem for you.

Thanks!

"As you are aware, the legal group has been considering EPMI's options given 
TVA's failure during the summer of 99 to treat Enron's control areas in a 
manner similiar to other control areas. 

 One option we have considered is the possibility of claiming monetary 
damages against TVA  for TVA's breach of NERC policies.  In order to make 
such a statement, we would, in essence, be required to assert that the NERC 
policies are a ""contract"" which all NERC members are obligated to abide by 
and for which the failure to do so could result in monetary damages.  One 
concern with this strategy is whether EPMI and/or its affiliates could 
possibly be damaged in other, unrelated  proceedings if it was determined 
that NERC policies were indeed ""contractual obligations"" (e.g., a third party 
claims monetary damages against EPMI for an alleged violation of NERC 
""contractual policies"").

It would be very helpful if you would consider this issue and get back to me 
with any thoughts or comments you have.

Thanks for your help.

Hi Jeff-
Howz it going?  Long time no see - we need to do a happy hour so that we can
catch up!  Hope you had a blast at the Resort at Squaw of couple of weekends
ago.  Wasn't it a gorgeous weekend!  

So, Meg called and asked me to contact one of the individuals on your list
of names because that person - Ashish Bhargava- had a specific question
around choosing between day and evening programs. Since I had to make a
similar decision, Meg thought I should talk to him. 

If you have already called him, don't worry about it.  If not, go ahead and
we can trade someone from my list, and I will call Ashish.  Just let me know
who you pick on my list!

Take care,
Deepika

Comrades:

Attached you will find the call assignments for the
new admits.  We all have five or six people to call in
the next 7-10 days.   I made a couple of matches where
it seemed there was some kind of similarity in
background or career, but for the most part, the
assignments were essentially random.  The list
includes names, phones at home and work, company and
title.

Remember these are newly admitted students who have
not yet accepted our offer of admission.  The deadline
to accept this offer is April 27th.

A general outline of the phone call, should you choose
to use it, would be:

1) Congratulations on being admitted to the Haas
School

2) indentify yourself as ""involved with the student
government at the Haas School, and the evening office
asked me to give you a call to see if you had any
questions about the program.  Then answer the
questions, if you can, or refer them to me or Ken for
further follow-up

3)describe your own experience at school and how it
has worked with your career--timing, advancement,
scheduling, tuition payments, etc.

4)invite them to attend a class so we can show them
around.  EMBA office will coordinate.

5)remind them of the ""New Students Admit Reception"" on
April 19th from 7-9 in the Wells Fargo Room (drinks
and hors d'oeuvres served). (Refer to Diane's recent
email for other particulars. 

Some pieces of information you might want to have
handy
 
-required new student orientation is August 11-12;
classes start on the 13th

-fees will be $1580 per unit; 42 units required,
including the two units for MPAR

-orientation packages will be sent out mid-June

-administration will call each new student in July
with class schedules

-second round of admits come out in early June

Thanks very much for helping.  Let me know if there is
anything else you may need or could suggest to help in
this effort.

"Scott,

Carlos Sole' is supporting Mitch and John's efforts relating to BPUB, ie, 
coal fired generation.  Any contracts for that effort should be coordinated 
through Carlos.  Carlos will assist with the coordination of the finance and 
accounting requirements.  Due to the complexity of the issues some lead time 
is necessary.  Unfortunately, there are no ""forms"" for generation projects 
(given accounting/finance requirements), or any assurance that a contract 
that worked a month ago will work now. 

My preference is that contracts not be sent to counterparties prior to ENA 
(or EECC) Legal review.

Thanks,

Kay

Scott,

Please find attached below a copy of the Amendment 2 and Transmittal letter 
that I just sent to Burns & Roe today as well as an electronic copy of their 
PSA Agreement.  Hard copies are in interoffice mail.

I am also attaching the latest standard Tasking Letter form for work being 
done for EECC.  If work is to be done for another Enron entity, an affiliate 
Tasking Letter for would be used.  Bart Clark has used the Tasking Letter 
form on an exception basis for Turbo Park projects; however, ENA needs to 
review the language within the Tasking Letter prior to execution to ensure 
that it conforms to the accounting requirements of off balance sheet 
financing.  You need to ensure that an ENA attorney has reviewed everything 
prior to your sending it out because one error in a contract could cause the 
entire project to be put on the balance sheet.

Let me know if you need anything else.

I am also copying those ENA attorneys which you mentioned were assisting with 
the Coal Initiative so that they have the opportunity to review and comment 
on this Agreement and how it relates to that project.

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES=20

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Federal energy regulators may investigate whether =
the operator of California's wholesale electricity market has been manipula=
ting its power-purchasing practices to reduce the costs of power the state =
purchased under long-term contracts, according to documents obtained Friday=
 by Dow Jones Newswires Friday.=20

At issue is whether the California Independent System Operator has violated=
 its own market rules by purchasing expensive power secured by the state un=
der contracts rather than cheaper power available in the spot market. The s=
tate's need to sell off surplus power secured under those contracts has pro=
ven embarrassing for Gov. Gray Davis, who signed $43 billion in deals to he=
ad off a summer of spiking prices and blackouts that never materialized.=20

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will hold a meeting in California =
Monday to address generators' complaints. The energy companies say that the=
 California ISO's purchasing decisions are difficult to comprehend and out =
of line with the market, according to a letter sent by Andrea Wolfman, lead=
 FERC counsel for market oversight and enforcement.=20

The letter was sent to the ISO, the California Department of Water Resource=
s - which has been buying power in lieu of the state's struggling utilities=
 since mid-January - and several generators, all of which were to attend th=
e meeting.=20

""Recently we have become concerned that the scheduling and dispatch procedu=
res of the California ISO, as they have had to change in the last nine mont=
hs, are not well understood or are not well suited to the current market st=
ructure,"" Wolfman said in her letter. ""The purpose of the meeting is to dev=
elop agreement between the ISO and those that participate in the scheduling=
 and dispatch (generators, utilities, CDWR) on appropriate practices and pr=
ocedures.""=20

ISO Procedures Need Explaining -FERC=20

The ISO's main responsibility is keeping power supply and demand in balance=
 on the state's electrical grid. As part of that job, the ISO determines wh=
ich power plants to call into service and which suppliers to buy power from=
.=20

If the ISO can't explain how it makes its decisions, FERC may conduct an au=
dit of the organization and investigate the possibility it has manipulated =
the market, Wolfman's office said.=20

""As discussed, FERC may schedule a technical conference and operational aud=
it of CAISO,"" a second letter from FERC's market oversight and enforcement =
division states. ""This unprecedented examination of CAISO operations could =
lead to the belief that complaints by generators of market manipulation and=
 other practices by the ISO should be investigated.""=20

The ISO's operating rules generally call for it to purchase the cheapest po=
wer first.=20

""The information that (generators) have provided all leads to a theory that=
 the CAISO is manipulating the market in order to purchase surplus DWR powe=
r at high prices and protect Gov. Davis from political embarrassment,"" the =
second letter says.=20

The ISO has said only that the market isn't operating as intended, and decl=
ined to answer other questions about the allegations or discuss Monday's me=
eting.=20

arently inexpensive power in the ISO's spot market only to find weeks later=
 that the price was much higher. That's because, according to the allegatio=
ns, the ISO is letting DWR supply expensive power into the market as ""out-o=
f-market"" purchases that aren't averaged into the real-time prices that ISO=
 market participants see.=20

DWR continues to buy out-of-market power regularly at the ISO's request, DW=
R operations chief Pete Garris has said, but those purchases are being made=
 in the spot market and are never being satisfied by power from DWR's long-=
term contracts.=20

The out-of-market purchases appear to be expensive, however. According to t=
he ISO's August market report, the average out-of-market price for peak hou=
rs was $55.90 a megawatt-hour, compared with $26.49/MWh on the ISO computer=
ized market. Brokered prices of western electricity have been lower than th=
e out-of-market prices for months.=20

None of the companies mentioned was willing to comment on the record.=20

The meeting is scheduled to be held at the ISO's headquarters in Folsom, Ca=
lif., and representatives from power producers, utilities and the state are=
 expected to attend. FERC will serve as facilitator, Wolfman said. The meet=
ing isn't open to the public.=20

The meeting will begin with a presentation by the ISO on its practices and =
operational procedures, followed by adjustments that may be needed to impro=
ve the market.=20

""The objective is to develop a written set of procedures that is agreed to =
by all the market participants and that is consistent with good utility pra=
ctices,"" Wolfman said in the letter.=20

"One minor edit---it's the PX, not the ISO, that's taken itself into voluntary 
bankruptcy.  See redline version attached.  

Only other comment:  I'm not sure that, technically/contractually, we entered 
into transactions with the PX (in the same way that I don't think that folks 
enter into transactions with NYMEX).  (See opening line of last paragraph.)  

We have exposure to thePX based on our commercial activity that took place 
through the PX, and that exposure depends on how the PX /FERC decide 
particular issues.  In short, we have transactions with the utilities, and 
exposure to the PX based on transactions that we entered into with other 
counter parties via the PX market mechanism.  That said, seems to me that, 
for the purposes of the disclosure, the language is fine---just want to raise 
the flag. Might be useful to run it by Richard Sanders.

Hope this helps.

In this third e-mail, I write you concerning the interest expressed by two
colleagues in being considered for employment by Enron Corp.:

1.  The first candidate is UT Finance Ph.D. student James Doran, who is
confidentially re-evaluating his interest in the Ph.D. program.  James has
done some consulting work with me in the energy area, and thus has some
background in the field.  Although his quantitative/computing skills do not
quite match those of Cantekin, I strongly believe they warrant an
invitation for interview at Enron, and recommend you consider such an
invitation affirmatively.

I enclose James' resume in Resume2001.doc.

2.  The second candidate is David B. Good, formerly of the Nucleus Corp.  A
resident of Houston, Dave has an MBA from Wharton and several years
experience in the energy sector.  You met Dave during the recent EPRM
training course in Houston.  I have had occasion to work with Dave whilst
he was director of quantitative analysis at Nucleus Corp. and have found
him an MBA with good quantiative skills and excellent intuition.  While I
cannot recommend him for your Research Group, I believe he is well suited
for a structuring/marketing position within Enron.

Dave's resume is also enclosed herewith in DBG resume.doc.

Should you and/or your colleagues have any questions regarding James or
Dave, please feel free to contact me.

The process for approving these involves sending the names to the General

"Just so we're clear.  To say that it would not be a problem for very large tranches of customers to leave the system as part of ""community aggregation,""  and then say it WOULD be a problem for individual customers to do the same, is, well, ridiculous.  In short, if you can work out the terms and conditions under which potentially huge tranches can go DA, then it is certainly feasible to do the same thing for individual customers. Finally, we're checking, but it seems that it will be be extremely difficult to say that its legally kosher for the PUC to permit DA under 9X, but suspend all other DA.  Very interesting.

http://www.etei.org/handbook_changed.htm. 

 In general, the site http://www.etei.org/ is a great source of info, and the 
the parent site, http://www.emissions.org should be checked out as well. If 
you'd like me to purchase the handbook (it will take three weeks) let me know.

Looks good.  I'll work to fill in some of the details.

To make matters worse, one of the two units had a compressor blade break off, 
taking the whole unit down (lost 180 Mw).  We might want to hold off until 
Monday when we have a better idea of the total damage and the total time the 
unit will be down.

2. Key Barriers to Distributed Generation

Excessive and Unnecessary Utility Stand-by Charges

Solution: The executive orders issued by the Governor on February 14th took=
 a=20
step in the right direction.  Utility stand-by charges have always been=20
designed by the utilities to protect their monopoly position, extract=20
monopoly prices from customers, or both.  But there is no reason to limit t=
he=20
elimination of these charges to generation facilities that are less than=20
1MW.  These limits will only lengthen unnecessarily the time it takes for=
=20
California to close the significant gap between supply and demand and reduc=
e=20
the risk of black outs this summer.  We would propose lifting the cap by=20
offering amendments to SB27X, which is designed to facilitate development o=
f=20
distributed generation.
=20
Excessive delays and costs related to interconnecting facilities with=20
investor-owned and municipal utilities

Solution:   The Governor=01,s executive order regarding interconnection is =
a=20
step in the right direction=01*D-D-26-01 requires utilities to complete=20
interconnection studies within 7 days.  California should ensure that this=
=20
requirement applies to all generation facilities, including distributed=20
generation.  In addition, the financial conflicts the utilities face when=
=20
interconnecting generation facilities are simply too powerful to overcome=
=20
through executive orders or other regulations.  To the greatest extent=20
possible, California should shift control over interconnection away from th=
e=20
utility and place that control with the California ISO.  This could be=20
accomplished through amendments to SB 27X.

Permitting and Air Quality Issues
Developers of distributed (i.e., =01&on-site=018) generation that is 50 MWs=
 or=20
greater must receive certification from the California Energy Commission an=
d=20
therefore face all of the impediments to development that large-scale=20
generation faces. =20

Solution: California should ensure that the executive orders (D-22-01 thru=
=20
D-26-01) issued by the Governor to expedite plant siting and maximize plant=
=20
output apply equally to smaller scale, =01&distributed generation=018 facil=
ities.=20
In addition, distributed generation that is less than 50 MWs continues to=
=20
face local opposition.  The State should ensure that local, parochial=20
interests cannot block otherwise beneficial distributed generation projects=
. =20
These objectives could be accomplished through amendments to SB27X.

3. Credit Concerns Regarding Authority Granted to DWR in AB1X to Purchase=
=20
Electricity on Behalf of the Utilities=20

Enron responded to the RFP issued by DWR to enter into power contracts with=
=20
suppliers.
Enron is in active discussions with DWR to establish contract terms with th=
e=20
goal of entering into a power purchase agreement as soon as possible.
However, ambiguities contained in AB1X have created significant credit risk=
=20
concerns that need to be resolved in order to finalize contract terms.
We understand that the lion=01,s share of counterparties share Enron=01,s c=
redit=20
risk concerns.
Enron has proposed several options for resolving the credit risk issues and=
=20
is working with DWR to arrive at a solution that is mutually agreeable to=
=20
both sides and that might serve as a template for power purchase agreements=
=20
going forward.

Summary of the Source of the Credit Risk Issue

Ambiguous Ratemaking Authority
The language in AB1X is ambiguous as to whether DWR has any authority to=20
charge California ratepayers for the costs of purchasing power.  From our=
=20
analysis of the bill, the language in AB1X appears to leave intact the=20
California PUC=01,s exclusive jurisdiction over ratemaking in California.  =
As=20
such, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree to include in rat=
es=20
adequate charges to cover DWR=01,s costs of power purchases.

Ambiguous Regulatory Authority Regarding Contract =01&Prudence=018
The language in AB1X leaves open the possibility that the California Public=
=20
Utilities Commission could determine that power purchases made by DWR are=
=20
=01&imprudent.=018  On the basis of such a finding, the CPUC could then ref=
use to=20
allow DWR to collect from ratepayers the costs associated with its power=20
purchases.  Consequently, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agr=
ee=20
to include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that=
=20
DWR has entered into with suppliers.
=20
Ambiguous Language Regarding the Ratemaking Mechanism that Will Be Used to=
=20
Recover DWR=01,s Costs of Power Purchases
In addition to the ambiguity regarding ratemaking and regulatory authority=
=20
noted above, the language in the bill is equally ambiguous with respect to=
=20
the specific ratemaking =01&mechanics=018 that AB1X directs the PUC to empl=
oy to=20
permit DWR to recover its power purchase costs. Based on our analysis, it i=
s=20
extremely difficult to determine how the PUC would design the rates to ensu=
re=20
DWR recovers its power purchase costs.  Moreover, as currently drafted, it =
is=20
difficult to determine whether AB1X would even permit the PUC to include in=
=20
rates all of the charges necessary to fully recover DWR=01,s power purchase=
=20
costs.  Again, this ambiguity raises significant credit risk concerns since=
=20
suppliers have little assurance that DWR will have the ability to recover=
=20
from ratepayers the costs of purchasing power.

Options to Resolve Concerns Regarding Credit Risk=20

We have been working diligently with DWR officials to resolve the credit ri=
sk=20
issues.  We have identified three options:

Amend AB1X
The amendments, which are attached to this email, would clarify that a) the=
=20
PUC would accept as =01&prudent and reasonable=018 all purchase costs incur=
red by=20
DWR, and b) the PUC is obligated to include in rates the charges necessary =
to=20
ensure that DWR fully recovers its costs of power purchases.  This is the=
=20
preferred option, though we understand that the there may be some political=
=20
challenges standing in the way of amending AB1X.  (See attached file=20
entitled, =01&AmendAB1X.doc=018.)

Clarify the Ambiguities in AB1X through an Order Issued by the PUC, and=20
through Contract Language
This is the option that we are currently working with DWR officials to=20
implement.  However, it is more complicated and could take significantly mo=
re=20
time to implement than the ""legislative"" fix.  We have attached electronic=
=20
copies of the talking points related to the order that the California PUC=
=20
would need to issue under this option.  (See attached file entitled,=20
=01&cpuctalkingpoints.doc.=018)

Make Use of Other Instruments Designed to Address Credit Risk
As indicated in our letter responding to DWR=01,s RFP, we are willing to ac=
cept=20
other forms of credit from DWR.  Those options include a letter of credit,=
=20
cash prepayment, or an acceptable form of collateral.  DWR officials have=
=20
indicated to us that DWR prefers to pursue the second options. That is, DWR=
=20
prefers to clarify the ambiguities in AB1X through a PUC order and through=
=20
contract amendments.

4. California=01,s Supply-demand Picture Heading into Summer 2001

Both the California Energy Commission and Cambridge Energy Research=20
Associates (CERA), a private sector energy think tank, have issued reports=
=20
showing that California faces a severe supply-demand imbalance.  They diffe=
r=20
only on how much and how soon additional supply will be made available.  Al=
l=20
credible sources agree that supply will be very tight throughout the Summer=
=20
of 2001 and that unless a solution is found immediately, blackouts are=20
likely. =20

CEC and CERA both forecast that California will be short of supply this=20
summer by approximately 5,000 MW.   These numbers are in line with our=20
estimates.  California=01,s supply base currently has a 6% capacity margin,=
 well=20
below the average 15-20%, which is recommended for reliable system operatio=
n=20
in the West.  Since the West relies more heavily upon hydroelectric power=
=20
than other regions, reserves are particularly important, owing to the=20
unpredictability of the weather and the dry year the West has experienced t=
o=20
date. In the event of a low rain and snow period, the system must possess t=
he=20
flexibility to respond to the reduced availability of power supply. =20
California=01,s very low reserve margin makes it especially susceptible to =
this=20
requirement. =20

Other reasons for reduced supply for the Summer of 2001 include the early=
=20
draw-down of reservoirs in the continual effort to manage California's seve=
re=20
supply-demand gap; emissions restrictions on existing plants; and a reduced=
=20
number of customers who can be curtailed under their contracts with the=20
utilities.  Cambridge Energy Research Associates asserts that at the curren=
t=20
pace of siting, permitting and construction, adequate supplies will not be=
=20
added to correct the market imbalance until 2003 at the earliest.

CERA predicts that California is likely to face approximately 20 hours of=
=20
rolling black outs this summer.  The CEC paints a considerably more=20
optimistic scenario, betting that California will bring an additional 5,000=
=20
MWs on line to meet peaking summer demand.  It is our view that California=
=20
should view the CEC's ""rosy scenario"" with considerable skepticism.

5. Suggested Package of Legislative Proposals Designed to Solve California=
=01,s=20
Electricity Crisis

This email offers an overview of our proposed legislative solution.  We wil=
l=20
deliver to your office tomorrow specific legislative language and existing=
=20
bills that we believe can accommodate our proposals.

As we have suggested throughout the crisis, any solution to California's=20
crisis must focus on four issues:

Increase supply
Decrease demand
Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market
Return California=01,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency

Increase supply--Legislative vehicle: SB28X (Sher)
To site and construct a power plant in Texas takes approximately 2 years. =
=20
Enron and others have completed the entire process in other states in less=
=20
than a year.  In California, it takes about six years, or longer.

The Governor=01,s executive orders and Senator Sher=01,s siting reform legi=
slation=20
are steps in the right direction.  Our suggested amendments can improve tho=
se=20
efforts by further addressing the difficulties that project developers face=
=20
in securing air emission reduction credits to meet the air permit=20
requirements included in the CEC's certification requirements.  Enron=01,s=
=20
proposal seeks to streamline the process for 1) obtaining credits and 2)=20
transfering credits between air districts.  In addition, it creates an=20
innovative emissions reduction bank to allow project sponsors to fund=20
emissions in advance of obtaining certification, and permits the affected a=
ir=20
districts to use those funds to finance projects that will produce the=20
required reductions in pollution emissions.

Decrease demand=01*Legislative Vehicle:   AB31X (Wright)
Because of the delay in getting a solution in place in California, closing=
=20
the supply-demand gap through energy conservation and efficiency offers the=
=20
best chance of avoiding blackouts this summer.  This can be accomplished mo=
st=20
effectively and quickly in two ways:

Buy-down demand
California is tapping into an enormous amount of money from the General Fun=
d=20
to finance DWR=01,s power purchases.  California could likely reduce demand=
 more=20
economically by running an auction to determine the payments businesses wou=
ld=20
be willing to receive to reduce their demand for a sustained period (e.g.,=
=20
through the summer months).  DWR could easily run an on-line auction to=20
determine the price it could pay for these demand reductions.  To=20
participate, businesses would be required to have the metering equipment=20
necessary to monitor and verify that they are actually achieving the=20
reductions.  Enron has developed an on-line auction software package, =01&D=
eal=20
Bench,=018 that it would be willing to contribute to the effort.

Use Price Signals to Incent Voluntary Curtailment
To be successful, customers need access to the following key elements:

An internet based hour-ahead price posting system to track the market price=
=20
for hour-ahead power in real time.=20
Real-time metering systems for baseline demand and voluntarily curtailment=
=20
verification.
Settlement process that allows for market clearing prices of energy to be=
=20
paid for load reduction (=01&Negawatts=018).

The potential benefits of an effective demand response program would includ=
e:

=01&creation=018 of additional summer peaking capacity in California, parti=
cularly=20
in the short term, without requiring construction of additional generation=
=20
resources.
reduction of  peak or super-peak load on the over-stressed California=20
electric system, thus potentially reducing the overall cost of electricity =
in=20
the state.
fostering of demand elasticity without subjecting customers to the full ris=
k=20
of hourly market price volatility by passing market price signals to=20
customers and allowing them to voluntarily shed load and be compensated for=
=20
responding.=20

We estimate that we could generate a summer 2001 on-peak demand response in=
=20
excess of 400 MW during certain high cost hours, and a demand response for=
=20
summer 2002 on-peak hours that could exceed 1000 MW.  We further estimate=
=20
that the market response to this program from all ESPs could be 2 to 3 time=
s=20
that amount.  We recommend that the State of California provide rebates=20
directly to customers to fund the installation of advanced metering and=20
control systems that would support load curtailment implementation.

Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market=01*Legislative vehi=
cle:=20
SB27X
The only customers who were protected from price volatility in San Diego we=
re=20
customers who chose Direct Access and signed fixed price deals with energy=
=20
service providers.  Ironically, AB1X takes that important option away from=
=20
customers and businesses.  It is critical that AB1X be amended to remove th=

Hi Leatha,

Neil and I went to D Taylor and looked at an Escalade. We liked it,
however, we want to price it with a couple of extra features.  I like the
extra wood package, and Neil likes it with the gold trim package.  When we
asked for a price, it added around $1700, which I thought was ridiculous.
They offered to discount it by $200, which I again thought was ridiculous.
When we priced these options at McGinniss, the price was less ($600 for the
wood package instead of $995, for instance), and they offered to discount
the options by a third.  So, we can get the deal done if they will get
reasonable over these options.  The sales guy (Nathaniel) was going to
""work on it"".  The fellow you had told us to ask for wasn't in, by the way.

I will be out of town on Monday, but Neil will be in, and will have my
Lexus.

Thanks,

Kay

Subject: Can Fibre Lackawanna

I have received notice from Can Fibre Lackawanna that there are in default 
under the payment obligation under the Subordinated Loan Agreement.  The 
Subordination provisions state that until the Senior Debt is paid off in 
full, the Subordinated Lenders (thats us) can not accelerate, foreclose, 
etc.  There is not 180 day period.  There is nothing.  Nonetheless, this does 
highlight the need to get these documents reviewed by counsel and start to 
weigh our options and strategy.  This is specially true for matters with 
respect to the Construction Completion and the additional $4.5 million that 
remains unfunded.  The letter of credit backing the $4.5 million obligation 
expires on June 30, 2001.  At that time we have an argument that we will not 
replace the letter of credit and because they are in default, we are not 
going to fund.

I think we should start having outside counsel get up to speed on this now.   
Can Fibre knows we do not want to fund and so it is better to be prepared.  
An analysis would include.

1.  Review of the applicable conditions to fund the $4.5 million and make 
sure that all steps are taking to hold them to the letter of the agreement.  
In particular, since they tests are under the terminated EPC contract, we 
want to make certain that no rights have been waived.  Also, we want to put 
them on notice that they have to follow everything to the letter and we need 
to develop any strategy or experts to contest any certifications.

2.  Review the documents to see if there is any wiggle room based on the 
current default.

3.  Understand our obligations.  The loan agreement requires us to fund $4.5 
million upon completion (regardless of the posting of the letter of credit).  
By being in default, does that provide us a defense to funding.  Can they 
cure the default and make us fund.  What does bankruptcy do to this scenario.

Let me know your thoughts and who we can talk to regarding these issues.

"Mark:

Per our conversation, I understand that the Canadian company has a number of 
outstanding OTC FX transactions with one or more counterparties.  Each of 
those transactions should be documented by a confirmation which confirms the 
economic terms of each deal.  Each confirmation must be subject to (1) an 
existing type of master agreement (such as the ISDA, IFEMA, FEOMA), (2) a 
""deemed"" version of such an agreement or (3) ""terms and conditions"" appearing 
in the confirmation itself.  It is quite likely that in any of these three 
types of confirmations, there are provisions for assignment of trades, credit 
event upon merger, material adverse change, additonal events of default or 
termination, etc.  which may be triggered by the pending acquisiton of the 
Canadian company.  Further, there may be credit issues associated with the 
transactions and/or master agreements (in the form of specific credit 
provisions in a confirmation or a credit annex to the master agreement).  As 
a result, a party attempting to ""step into the shoes of the Canadian company"" 
must review the existing documents, subject to any confidentiality 
restrictions, in order to evaluate the positions and risks associated with 
assuming those positions.

Thus, we need to conduct a thorough due diligence of the financial trading 
positions of the Canadian company.  Please let me know if you have any 
questions.

We are pleased to announce the formation of the Credit Markets Group which is 
responsible for developing innovative products to better manage the risk of 
our internal credit portfolio as well as, looking  for opportunities to 
provide third party credit protection.  Initially, we will be making markets 
in bankruptcy protection on reference credits which are currently in our 
portfolio but we expect to add additional credit products and reference 
credits very quickly.

The team will utilise EnronOnline as its primary trade execution tool, 
looking to quickly build market share by capturing the eyes of our current 
counterparts.  Simultaneously,  we will launch an external web site focused 
on credit protection where potential customers will have access to real time 
prices and filter on specific reference credits as well as, access to credit 
models and research papers on effective credit risk management.  Utilising 
e-commerce business principles, we expect to aggressively claim the space for 
corporate credit protection.  We expect to make a public announcement about 
these new products in late January.

In order to effectively access the global market for credit protection, the 
group will be based in London with an initial local desk set up in Houston as 
well.  Bryan Seyfried will be transitioning out of RAC, where he was 
responsible for the Trading Controls and Research teams in Europe, to lead 
the group and he will report to me.

		 Subject: New Security and Human Rights Policy - Legal Comments

Rob has asked me to collect legal department views on the attached statement 
of principles regarding Security and Human Rights that Enron Corp is 
considering endorsing. These have been worked out over the past several 
months by a task force of the US and UK governments, along with 
representatives of industry (including Enron) and NGOs (including Amesty and 
Human Rights Watch) under the auspices of Secretary fo State Albright and 
Foreign Secretary Cook.  As a result, we really don't  have the ability to 
change the text, which is fixed. 

As you know, Enron is very concerned about human rights issues because of 
their intrinsic value and their community relations impacts.These guidelines 
would be in addition to the Human Rights Policy Statement the Enron board 
adopted last year, which really do not touch on security matters as such. I 
have sent this to each of your since your business units are those that have 
the most extensive operations in the developing countries in which these 
issues are of primary concern.  (I am separately collecting comments/concerns 
from within EES and EECC.)

The Enron effort on this guideline project has been lead by Lauren Goldblatt 
of the Corp. PR group. Lauren has run the attached drafts past Mike Hicks and 
Pete Vandergam at Corp. Security for their views of whether this can be 
implemented by Enron.  We as the legal department have been asked to express 
our view on are the following:

(a) Are there any show stoppers that would argue that Enron should not 
publicly express its ""endorsement"" of these polices?
(b) If Enron were to express its endorsement of the policy statement, what if 
any material problems do you think your business line might encounter in 
implementing the policy?
(c) Do you see any unintended practical or legal consequences that might 
arise from Enron publicly adopting or endorsing this as policy?

Please take an hour few hours to read through the materials, or have one of 
your lawyers do so. You might need to consult with your operation personnel 
for their practical views as well.   I would be grateful if you could express 
any concerns you may see with the guidelines by November 7 (Wednesday) so 
that I can coordinate comments and get the responses out.   (The deadline for 
Enron and other companies to express their endorsement of the policy has been 
extended from the November 8 deadline expressed in the attached to November 
15. To allow time for Enron to deal with responses, we have been asked to get 
our feed back to Lauren by November 8 (Thursday).)

You cane-mail your comments or phone them to  me at 713-646-6309. If I get 
suffucient expressions of interest for a conference call by Monday, I will 
set up a call in number for Wednesday morning US.

"FYI. Split between Davis and Lynch is now very public.  Davis is likely losing his mind.  Can Ron Carroll or Dan Watkiss search these filings down at FERC?  Thanks.
Best,

State PUC seeks to void Davis's power contracts 
Deals gouge consumers, agency tells federal regulators 
In a move that could undermine California's hard-won control of the power market, state regulators are urging the federal government to throw out prices for some electricity contracts agreed to by Gov. Gray Davis. 
The state Public Utilities Commission, in what amounts to a rearguard action against the governor's power strategy, is arguing that some of the deals gouge Californians. The PUC says energy firms probably took advantage of the state's power crisis earlier this year to charge unfairly high prices, and it wants some of those prices cut. 
""The state is going to get itself into serious trouble with those contracts if they're not renegotiated,"" Commissioner Richard Bilas said. ""I would support anything that would help us get the prices of those contracts down."" 
The PUC apparently did not tell Davis administration officials that it was challenging the contracts before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
""It's definitely not something that's a favorable thing to have happen to us,"" said Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the state Department of Water Resources, which negotiated the contracts. 
Hidalgo said the long-term contracts, even though more expensive than current market prices, are the bulwark that protects the state from another round of spiraling spot market prices. 
""It would be a mistake to try to void those contracts out,"" Hidalgo said. ""If that's the goal, then we're back to square one. Prices would start to creep up."" 
The state is paying an average of $69 a megawatt hour under the contracts it has signed with private generators. Peak prices for electricity last week were less than $30. 
Hidalgo could not say whether the PUC actions could expose the state to lawsuits by the contractors or threaten a planned $12.5 billion bond issue to repay the state general fund for the power purchases. 
Over the past three months, lawyers for the PUC have filed challenges on various grounds before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission against deals negotiated with PacifiCorp Power Marketing Inc., Alliance Colton LLC, Sempra Energy and a Calpine Corp. subsidiary, said PUC attorney Sean Gallagher. 
SEMPRA, CALPINE CONTRACTS
Taken together, Sempra and Calpine have sold about half the electricity that the Davis administration has agreed to buy in an array of 53 agreements, some of which last 20 years. In all, California has committed to spending at least $43 billion for electricity. 
The deal with PacifiCorp Power Marketing has already come under attack because while the state was negotiating the $1 billion contract, one of Davis' energy consultants owned stock in the power supplier's parent company. 
Gallagher said PUC attorneys may recommend commission actions against other contracts. 
Davis' spokesman Steve Maviglio said Friday the administration couldn't comment until it had studied the PUC submissions. 
The PUC's challenges mark the latest battle between Davis and the five- member commission, which is resisting administration energy policies even though it is controlled by the governor's three appointees. 
The commission has rebuffed Davis' attempts to nail down a mechanism for utility customers to cover the costs of the long-term power contracts and pay off the planned $12.5 billion bond issue. 
STATE TREASURER'S WARNING
State Treasurer Phil Angelides warned last week that the PUC's actions threatened to delay the bond issue and leave a $9 billion hole in the state budget next year. 
PUC President Loretta Lynch opposes the bond plan because it requires the commission to rubber-stamp the power contracts and forces the state to maintain a prolonged role as an energy buyer. 
""We should not, through the instrument of the bonds, lock down the policy choices for the state for 15 years,"" Lynch said last week. ""We should stay as flexible as possible. 
Lynch could not be reached for comment on the commission's challenges to the contracts. 
Commissioner Jeff Brown, Lynch's fellow Davis appointee, said the filings don't rule out Davis' bond financing deal. Nor do they threaten a state default on the long-term contracts, he said. But federal action could help the state improve the deals, he said. 
""The state of California has never consciously defaulted on a contract,"" he said. ""Even if we renegotiate, we'll renegotiate within the confines of the contract."" 
Hidalgo, however, said he doubted the state could modify the contracts. Under power granted by the Legislature, he said, the water department made its own finding that the contract prices were reasonable. 
Jan Mitchell, a spokeswoman for ScottishPower, parent company of PacifiCorp Power Marketing, said both sides agreed to the contract after full negotiations. 
""Now another California agency is disputing it,"" Mitchell said. ""We obviously disagree, and we'll continue to work with FERC, making sure the contracts are honored."" 
PUC CRITICAL OF DEALINGS
The PUC argues that the Portland energy firm wielded excessive market power when the state signed its 10-year, $1 billion deal with the company July 6. That forced the water department to accept unfair prices to avoid blackouts, the PUC says. 
""News reports suggest that the (water department) paid substantially over the then-current market prices for this contract, prices which will be passed through to California retail ratepayers,"" the PUC said. 
An energy consultant to Davis, Vikram Budhraja, admitted in August that he owned as much as $10,000 worth of Scottish Power stock while the deal was being worked out. Budhraja sold the stock July 30, and state officials said he had nothing to do with the PacifiCorp Power Marketing deal. 
Uncertainty over the contracts adds to growing turmoil in the state's energy picture. While the issue has slipped from the public eye, Davis' solutions to the energy crisis are meeting resistance not only from the PUC but from fellow Democrats in the state Senate, which has refused to pass his plan to stabilize Southern California Edison's finances and stave off a second utility bankruptcy filing. 
While officials fight among themselves, the energy industry is moving aggressively to reverse state efforts to put the brakes on deregulation.

Looks good, except for the comments on ""discourages generation"".  Make it 
""discourages peaking generation"".  

Although I agree that any price cap has a ""discouraging "" impact on the 
generation market, it is a matter of degree in this sound bite environment.  
To the point, without a creative exit strategy, I would not waste development 
money on a 10000-13000 BTU/KWh heat rate peaking project.  However, even with 
the FERC order, I will continue to spend money developing base load, 7000 
BTU/KWh heat rate projects.  The state is tremendously short on power, the 
price cap goes away (theoretically) in two years, $150 is well above the 
average expected price in our forcast models (although I agree not above the 
price for particular hours if scalers are applied.)

I agree with much of what Jeff has written.  Here are some additions -

On FERC getting a lot right, look at the Order in relation to our 4 key 
points filed in the White Paper -
Removing Market Transparency - Still need FERC to take action
Development of Forwards Market and Risk Management - Great results
Removing distortions on Prices - Wrong action
Ending Cal ISO / Cal PX Stakeholder Boards - Great results

On the risk management issue, FERC itself said ""The single most important 
remedy that California market needs is the elimination of rules that prevent 
market participants from managing risk"". [FERC PRESS RELEASE]

ADD - FERC Staff did a great job on preparing a detailed analysis of the 
market issues.

Here are the messages as I understand them.  Please let me know if I've 
misconstrued anything.  Thanks.

FERC got  a lot right in the order and we're very encouraged as a result.
In particular, ending the PX buy/sell requirement and permitting utilities to 
manage risk through a portfolio of short and long term contracts is a 
fundamental step in the right direction.
However, the proposed price cap is unworkable and will jeopardize realibility 
in California.  As structured, it will:
discourage the development of new generation to serve California
fail to provide adequate incentives for demand responsiveness.
force Enron to abandon 300 MWs of new power projects planned for California.
We look forward to participating in FERC's process and are hopeful that 
FERC's final order will fix the deficiencies in the current price cap 
proposal.
We encourage California to work with FERC to implement the proposals and 
quickly fix the flaws in the market on behalf of the state's consumers.

Exporters Rush to Ex-Im Bank's Defense --- Lobby Campaign to Prevent Budget 
Cuts Seeks Help Of 100,000 Small Firms
By Michael M. Phillips and Laura Heinauer
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

03/07/2001
The Wall Street Journal
A2
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

WASHINGTON -- Angry and confused that a Republican administration has 
targeted one of their favorite programs for big cuts, America's largest 
exporters are appealing for help from lawmakers. 
Boeing Co., Caterpillar Inc., Enron Corp., Halliburton Co. and others are 
launching an aggressive lobbying campaign on Capitol Hill to protect the 
Export-Import Bank from budget reductions; the White House labels the Ex-Im 
Bank as corporate welfare.
""The administration has fired its shot, and now we're firing ours,"" said 
Edmund B. Rice, president of the Coalition for Employment Through Exports, an 
industry group that is leading the effort. 
Since they got wind of the proposed cuts a few weeks ago, business lobbyists 
have been trying to rally sympathetic lawmakers. And executives at Boeing, 
Caterpillar and other big companies plan to contact some 100,000 smaller 
suppliers that benefit indirectly from the $12.6 billion of export loans, 
guarantees and insurance that Ex-Im Bank provided in the last fiscal year. 
Those small companies, the executives hope, will create a groundswell of 
support in Congress for the Ex-Im Bank. 
""Companies large and small who have similar interests here are banding 
together to provide an educational effort so people understand the impact of 
this,"" said Chris Hansen, Boeing senior vice president for government 
relations. 
Corporate lobbyists also have dug up a speech that Vice President Dick 
Cheney, while chief executive of Halliburton, gave in 1997 praising the bank 
and scoffing at those who consider it a giveaway to big business. They plan 
to pass Mr. Cheney's comments to influential members of Congress this week. 
""We'll be circulating them very broadly,"" Mr. Rice said. 
A spokeswoman for Mr. Cheney had no immediate comment. 
Ex-Im Bank officials aren't talking publicly, avoiding the appearance that 
they are battling the White House to overturn the proposed 25% cut in the 
bank's $865 million operating budget for the current fiscal year, which ends 
Sept. 30. But an Ex-Im official said the topic has come up in conversations 
between key lawmakers and Ex-Im Bank Chairman James A. Harmon, who is soon to 
be succeeded by Mel Sembler, a Bush campaign fund-raiser and a 
shopping-center developer. 
At first, business lobbyists assumed administration budgeteers were just 
looking for savings anywhere they could find it. Before President Bush 
released his spending plan last week, companies appealed to Mitchell Daniels, 
head of the White House budget office, in an attempt to keep the Ex-Im Bank 
cuts out of the final proposal. 
The Ex-Im Bank's corporate clients include some of the country's largest 
political contributors. Boeing, the bank's largest user, received $3.3 
billion of financing last year. The Seattle aerospace company and its 
employees contributed $1.8 million to politicians and parties during the 2000 
election cycle, 61% to Republicans, according to federal election data 
assembled by the Center for Responsive Politics. Caterpillar, a Peoria, Ill., 
maker of engines and heavy equipment that secured seven Ex-Im Bank deals last 
year, and its employees contributed more than $500,000 -- 96% to Republicans. 
Company officials deny they wanted to leverage donations to try to secure 
political support for the Ex-Im Bank. 
Many lobbyists have come to the conclusion that administration officials -- 
those of a libertarian persuasion -- oppose Ex-Im Bank as a form of welfare 
for corporations. Indeed, the White House budget plan criticized the bank's 
operations as unjustified public subsidies for companies. ""That makes it a 
much more serious issue,"" Mr. Rice said. ""We're concerned that the 
administration seems to be turning its attention in this direction."" 
Barring intervention from Mr. Cheney, business groups now have largely given 
up hope of convincing the White House to back down, planning instead to use 
their muscle to convince Congress to restore the Ex-Im Bank's funding. Bank 
officials and U.S. companies argue that, far from being a subsidy, the bank 
simply allows American companies to compete with European and Japanese firms 
that receive assistance from their own governments. 
""In many markets in Asia and Africa, the bank is absolutely critical to our 
ability to sell American-made products,"" said Bill Lane, Caterpillar's 
Washington director for governmental affairs.

[What's Brewing in the Real Estate Market] 
No Problem, Houston 
CENTURY DEVELOPMENT is about to announce plans to break ground on downtown 
Houston's third major office development in less than three years. In another 
sign of the strength of the city's energy sector, Century is finalizing a 
headquarters deal with Reliant Resources Inc. to take more than two-thirds of 
the project's 850,000 square feet, says Edwin Murphy, a Century senior vice 
president. 
Two other towers also are underway. In 1999, Hines began building a 1.2 
million square-foot tower for Enron Corp. and late last year Crescent Real 
Estate Equities broke ground on a 27-story tower that will be anchored by 
Ernst & Young. These three projects are the first major downtown office 
projects to get underway since 1986. 
The surge is part of a renaissance of downtown Houston, where new sports 
facilities, hotels, apartment buildings and restaurants have been mushrooming 
in recent years. ""The new amenities have kept people from leaving and enticed 
people to come back,"" says Michael Hassler, of CB Richard Ellis.

Dutch Gas Competition Grows Despite Sluggish Reforms

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- The Netherlands is emerging as an important testing 
ground for E.U. gas liberalization, as new trading hubs for competitive, 
short-term gas supplies from the U.K. and Norway emerge on the Belgian and 
German borders. 
However, much remains to be done. A group of large energy users and traders 
is preparing to confront Gasunie Thursday in a hearing organized by the 
regulator. The main issues of contention are the balancing system, which 
Gasunie conducts on an hourly basis, the extent to which transport tariffs 
are cost-focused and third-party access to storage facilities.
The emergence of competition in the Dutch gas sector is mostly due to the 
initiative of new market entrants who, despite a difficult regulatory 
environment, have managed to develop a market for short-term gas virtually 
from scratch. 
If liquidity improves in these emerging hubs, the Netherlands could become an 
important transit country for freely tradeable gas supplies to other 
countries in northwest Europe, as well as being an important market in its 
own right. However, the difficulty of implementing transparent third-party 
access systems in the Netherlands and in neighboring Germany casts a dark 
cloud over recent progress in competition. 
Since December, Enron Europe Ltd. (U.ENE), Duke Energy Corp. (DUK), E.On AG 
(EON), RWE AG (G.RWE) and Electrabel SA (B.ELE) have been actively buying and 
selling gas, sourced in the U.K., the Netherlands and Norway, in a number of 
hubs between Emden in Germany and Emshaven and Oude Statenzijl in the 
Netherlands. 
David Gallagher, head of European gas trading at Enron in London, estimates 
that at least one trade a day of around 100,000 therms for a quarterly 
contract is done at the Oude Statenzijl hub, where the Gasunie pipeline 
system connects to the network of Wingas GmbH. 
An important element kick-starting short-term trading was the sale, in 
December 2000, of a 2 billion cubic meter a year Norwegian gas supply 
contract to five Dutch-based power generators. 
Robert van der Hoeven, head of fuel procurement at Electrabel, the owner of 
Dutch generator EPON, said his company uses most of the gas it imports from 
Norway for its plants in the Netherlands and trades the rest on a short-term 
basis in the Oude-Emden area. This pattern is common to the other Dutch-based 
parties to that contract. 
Trading in Dutch hubs received a further boost when Nederlandse Gasunie NV 
(N.NEG) decided, after months of wrangling with regulator DTe, to lower its 
transport tariffs by 6.5% from January 2001 and to unbundle its combined 
commodity and service tariff, the so-called CSS system, from July 2001. 
Gasunie now claims its pipeline system is fully open and transparent. To 
prove this, it says it has lost 30% of its customers in the eligible market, 
but that figure hasn't changed much since March 2000. Small wonder that 
critics say the switching figure doesn't necessarily indicate an ideal system 
of third-party access. 
According to energy consultants The Brattle Group, around half of the gas 
used by alternative suppliers goes through the 1 bcm/year Zebra pipeline from 
Zelzate to Zeeland, which was built by Dutch utilities a few years ago 
precisely because Gasunie refused to provide access on favorable terms. 
Shippers have complained that the hourly system used by Gasunie to balance 
the pipeline system raises the overall cost of shipping through its network 
significantly. Gasunie imposes a balancing charge which effectively forces 
shippers to pay for the extra gas brought into the system from storage sites, 
in addition to the capacity and transmission price. Critics say Gasunie has 
so far failed to unbundle these charges, although it agreed to do so in 
January. 
According to the Brattle Group, another controversial aspect of Gasunie's 
tariff system is that it is based on theoretical costs of constructing new 
pipelines rather than its actual costs. 
The DTe is also considering ways of reforming the storage system to make it 
competitive. BP PLC (U.BP) and Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij NV operate 
storage facilities and lease capacity to Gasunie through long-term contracts. 
The regulator is studying ways of allowing third parties access to storage 
facilities. Gasunie has so far shown little sign of negotiating more 
competitive tariffs with storage operators and passing on the benefits to 
customers, critics say. 
The growth of short-term trading in the Dutch gas market is also inevitably 
linked to its potential as a transit country for gas coming from the 
U.K.-Belgium gas interconnector and going towards the 82bcm-a-year German 
market. 
Market participants say liquidity at the Emden and Oude hubs has grown 
considerably since E.On and RWE started trading there earlier this year. 
However, the obstructive attitude of incumbents toward third-party access 
there has meant that so far most gas traded in the Netherlands has remained 
there.

USA: Big U.S. exporters to fight Ex-Im Bank cuts - WSJ.

03/07/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, March 7 (Reuters) - America's largest exporters are launching an 
aggressive lobbying campaign on Capitol Hill to protect the Export-Import 
Bank from budget reductions, the Wall Street Journal reported in its online 
edition on Wednesday. 
The exporters, including Boeing Co. , Caterpillar Inc. , Enron Corp. , 
Halliburton Co. and others, are angry and confused that a Republican 
administration has targeted one of their favourite programmes for big cuts, 
the paper reported.
Ex-Im Bank officials were not talking publicly, avoiding the appearance that 
they are battling the White House to overturn the proposed 25 percent cut in 
the bank's $865 million operating budget for the current fiscal year, which 
ends Sept 30, it said. 
The White House labels the Ex-Im Bank as corporate welfare. 
""The administration has fired its shot, and now we're firing ours,"" Edmund 
Rice, president of the Coalition for Employment Through Exports, an industry 
group that is leading the effort, was quoted as saying by the paper. 
Executives at Boeing, Caterpillar and other big companies plan to contact 
some 100,000 smaller suppliers who benefit indirectly from the $12.6 billion 
of export loans, guarantees and insurance that Ex-Im Bank provided in the 
last fiscal year, the paper said. 
Those small companies, the executives hope, will create a groundswell of 
support in Congress for the Ex-Im Bank, it said.

Major U.S. Exporters Rush to Export-Import Bank's Defense

Dow Jones Business News

WASHINGTON -- Angry and confused that a Republican administration has 
targeted one of their favorite programs for big cuts, America's largest 
exporters are appealing for help from lawmakers, Wednesday's Wall Street 
Journal reported. 
Boeing Co. (BA), Caterpillar Inc. (CAT), Enron Corp. (ENE), Halliburton Co. 
(HAL) and others are launching an aggressive lobbying campaign on Capitol 
Hill to protect the Export-Import Bank from budget reductions; the White 
House labels the Ex-Im Bank as corporate welfare.
""The administration has fired its shot, and now we're firing ours,"" said 
Edmund B. Rice, president of the Coalition for Employment Through Exports, an 
industry group that is leading the effort. 
Since they got wind of the proposed cuts a few weeks ago, business lobbyists 
have been trying to rally sympathetic lawmakers. And executives at Boeing, 
Caterpillar and other big companies plan to contact some 100,000 smaller 
suppliers that benefit indirectly from the $12.6 billion of export loans, 
guarantees and insurance that Ex-Im Bank provided in the last fiscal year. 
Those small companies, the executives hope, will create a groundswell of 
support in Congress for the Ex-Im Bank. 
Corporate lobbyists also have dug up a speech that Vice President Dick 
Cheney, while chief executive of Halliburton, gave in 1997 praising the bank 
and scoffing at those who consider it a giveaway to big business. They plan 
to pass Mr. Cheney's comments to influential members of Congress this week. 
A spokeswoman for Mr. Cheney had no immediate comment. 
Ex-Im Bank officials aren't talking publicly, avoiding the appearance that 
they are battling the White House to overturn the proposed 25% cut in the 
bank's $865 million operating budget for the current fiscal year, which ends 
Sept. 30. But an Ex-Im official said the topic has come up in conversations 
between key lawmakers and Ex-Im Bank Chairman James A. Harmon, who is soon to 
be succeeded by Mel Sembler, a Bush campaign fund-raiser and a 
shopping-center developer.

Deal with state could take until 2002 to close
By LESLIE GORNSTEIN
AP Business Writer

03/06/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

LOS ANGELES (AP) - A tentative deal aimed at rescuing Southern California 
Edison from insolvency might not close in time to prevent the utility from 
begging creditors for more patience, Edison officials said Tuesday. 
The utility's tentative, $2.7 billion agreement to sell its power lines to 
the state could take until 2002 to be consummated, thanks to complicated 
legal issues and other paperwork, an Edison official told bondholders Tuesday.
Once the deal is signed, Edison will try to borrow against the promised cash, 
but Edison International Chief Financial Officer Ted Craver admitted the 
utility might have to ask creditors to simply wait for their money until it 
has the $2.7 billion in hand. 
Energy suppliers owed money by Edison did not immediately return calls for 
comment Tuesday. 
At least four groups of suppliers have sued Edison for millions in unpaid 
bills going back months. Edison and fellow utility Pacific Gas & Electric 
have said they have lost $13 billion on the open power market thanks to 
soaring prices paired with state-imposed price caps. 
PG&E's parent company was able to recently borrow $1 billion to pay its 
stockholders and its debuts. It did not use any of that money to pay PG&E's 
bills. 
Edison's disclosure, meanwhile, shocked state officials. 
Steve Maviglio, spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis, initially declined to comment 
on the status of the Edison deal, but eventually said, regarding its closure, 
""We're optimistic it will be sooner rather than later."" 
The pacing would have nothing to do with whether fellow utilities Sempra 
Energy and PG&E also sell their transmission lines to California, Craver 
said. 
Among the things that could delay the deal's closing is Edison's need to find 
landowners on whose property its lines were built to assure no legal 
agreements are being violated by the sale. Edison would also have to pin down 
exactly what it would be selling to the state - terms that might not be 
decided until after a deal has been inked, Craver said. 
""Trust me,"" Craver said in a phone call after the conference. ""There are a 
lot of legal-type documents - stuff that you and I ... would think of as a 
bloody nightmare."" 
The disclosure comes at a time when an increasing number of power suppliers 
are suing the utility for millions in unpaid bills. 
Edison also disclosed Tuesday that two more lawsuits had landed in its lap - 
one by a group of wind-powered generators including Enron Wind, the other by 
two suppliers including New York-based Caithness Energy. 
Both suits were filed during the past five days, Edison Assistant General 
Counsel Barbara Reeves said. It was not immediately clear how much the 
complainants were seeking; neither Enron nor Caithness returned calls for 
comment. 
The two filings bring the total number of suits by renewable-energy suppliers 
against Edison to four, the utility said. The city of Long Beach and 
CalEnergy Operating Group, a geothermal supplier, have also sued for back 
payments. 
CalEnergy alone has said it is owed $45 million in November and December 
payments. 
The line sale, part of a multifaceted, tentative deal with the state that 
could save Edison from insolvency, could take anywhere from several months 
into next year, Craver said. 
The tentative deal, announced by Gov. Gray Davis Feb. 23, calls for the state 
to pay more than twice the book value for Edison's lines. 
It also would require Edison to sell cheap power to the state for a decade 
and for Edison to end its lawsuit against state regulators. The suit asserts 
that price caps imposed by the California Public Utilities Commission are 
illegal under federal law. 
Additionally, Edison's parent would have to return $420 million it collected 
from the utility over the past several years. The money was used to pay debt, 
buy back stock and pay dividends to investors. 
SCE, PG&E and Sempra have complained they are near bankruptcy because of 
soaring prices on the open market combined with the state-imposed price caps 
for consumers. 
Sempra and PG&E have yet to announce similar line-sale deals with the state, 
though they and the governor have said negotiations are ongoing. The total 
cost of the 26,000 miles of lines has been estimated at $4.5 billion to $7 
billion.

Sierra Pacific CEO Doubts SEC OK Of Enron Unit Buy-Report

03/06/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Sierra Pacific Resources (SRP) CEO Walter Higgins 
said in an interview last week that he doubts the company's $3.1 billion 
acquisition of Enron Corp.'s (ENE) utility Portland General Electric will be 
approved by the federal Securities and Exchange Commission, the Las Vegas Sun 
reported Tuesday. 
The SEC must find that Sierra Pacific is in a strong financial position 
before it will approve the deal, but the company is currently weakened by 
having lost millions of dollars in fuel and purchased power costs, Higgins 
said in the report.
A $311 million rate increase to cover those costs began March 1, but Higgins 
said that money would only pay back those expenses and wouldn't improve the 
company's stability to a level the SEC would find adequate, according to the 
report. 
The Public Utilities Commission can halt the rate hike and order refunds if 
it decides the hike isn't necessary. The PUC is holding hearings to determine 
the prudency of the hike, and members of the state's powerful casino and 
mining industries have filed to intervene. 
Sierra Pacific's plan to shore up its financial position through the sale of 
its 10 power plants, worth nearly $2 billion, may also be in jeopardy. The 
state Senate is considering a bill to block the sales, and Nevada Gov. Kenny 
Guinn recently sent a letter to the PUC asking that it reconsider its order 
allowing electric utilities to sell assets. 
Financial analysts have said that not allowing Sierra Pacific's two utilities 
to sell their assets would have a ripple effect on the company's financial 
position. The asset sales are tied to low-priced power contracts, and if the 
sales are canceled, the low-priced power will be gone as well. 
""If the divestiture is stopped...the state may be dealing with a much bigger 
rate increase,"" Steve Fleishman, Merrill Lynch utility analyst, told Dow 
Jones Newswires recently. 
Sierra Pacific is the parent company of electric utilities Sierra Pacific 
Power Co. and Nevada Power, which serve customers in the state's North and 
South, respectively.

Many Power Deals Announced by California Governor Still Not Final
By Jason Leopold

03/06/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Dow Jones Newswires 
LOS ANGELES -- Many of the long-term power-supply contracts announced by 
California Gov. Gray Davis this week remain under negotiation or are the 
subject of ongoing lawsuits, power suppliers said Tuesday.
The lack of finality to the deals raises questions about the state's success 
in covering its power needs, particularly going into what is expected to be 
an unusually tight summer. 
Generators said privately they were surprised the governor went ahead with 
his announcement Monday, given that many of the contracts haven't been 
signed. 
David Freeman, general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and 
Power, who negotiated the contracts on behalf of the state, conceded that 
details remain to be worked out. ""This is not a done deal,"" Mr. Freeman said, 
adding that credit concerns are keeping generators from signing the deals. 
Gov. Davis announced Monday that California has secured 40 long-term 
contracts that will provide California with about 629 million megawatt hours 
of electricity over 10 years, at a price of more than $40 billion. A megawatt 
hour is roughly the amount of electricity needed to power 1,000 homes. 
Several of those forward deals, however, involve contracts originally held by 
Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison and PG&E Corp. 
(PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric at the California Power Exchange, 
previously the state's main power market. 
The governor seized those contracts earlier this year, just before the Power 
Exchange liquidated them to cover hundreds of millions of dollars in power 
bills the utilities had failed to pay. 
The contracts, which total about 1.3 million megawatt hours of electricity 
and have a market value of about $1 billion, according to market sources, 
have yet to be paid for or signed over to the state. Duke Energy Corp. (DUK), 
one of the suppliers that sold the contracts to Pacific Gas and SoCal Ed, has 
sued Gov. Davis for unlawfully commandeering those contracts. 
Although Duke has reached an interim settlement to continue providing power 
to the state Department of Water Resources until April 30, the company and 
the Davis administration still have to ""develop a comprehensive long-term 
settlement to pay for the power supply contracts,"" said Duke spokesman Tom 
Williams. 
The governor went ahead with the announcement, because the California 
Department of Water Resources believes it will be able to finalize and sign 
the contracts over the next several weeks, Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio 
said. 
Separately, several suppliers named in the governor's announcement Monday -- 
including Duke, Reliant Energy Inc. (REI), Mirant Corp. (MIR), Sempra Energy, 
Enron Corp. (ENE) and Avista Corp. (AVA) -- said they have yet to sign final 
agreements with the state, although negotiations were ongoing. 
""We are working in good faith with the DWR toward a long-term contract,"" said 
Art Larson, spokesman for Sempra Energy Resources, a unit of Sempra. Mr. 
Larson said Sempra signed a terms of agreement with the water-resources 
department and expects to reach a final agreement over the next several 
weeks. 
Reliant said it has only signed a short-term contract with the state that 
expires in about two weeks. The company will only sign a long-term contract 
once it's paid more than $400 million owed by Pacific Gas and SoCal Ed, 
spokesman Richard Wheatley said. 
Mirant said it also won't sign contracts with the state until it's paid. 
Enron said it's reached agreement on terms with the state, but has some 
credit-related details to hammer out. ""Everything's been agreed to except for 
some credit technicalities,"" Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said. 
Meanwhile, small, independent power plants in California that are capable of 
generating 1,800 megawatts of power are shut down because their owners 
haven't been paid by the state's two main utilities, the California 
Independent System Operator said Tuesday. 
The decline in small-plant output has contributed to the state's power-supply 
problems the past two months. Partnerships involving El Paso Corp. (EPG), for 
example, shut down 350 megawatts of generation last weekend due to 
nonpayment, the company said Tuesday. 
SoCal Ed hasn't paid the owners of the smaller generators, known as 
""qualifying facilities,"" since early December, which means the generators are 
still owed for electric production in October, while PG&E has paid only a 
small percentage of its qualifying facility bills since its last full payment 
in early January. 
The plants, one-third of which are powered by renewable sources like wind and 
solar power, meet almost 30% of California's electricity needs. Almost all of 
the closed generators are fueled by natural gas, and many haven't been able 
to pay their gas suppliers and have been cut off from their gas supply. 
The California Senate Energy Committee plans to vote on legislation to create 
a new pricing system for all qualifying facilities this week. The proposed 
bill would cut the prices to qualifying facilities from about 17 cents a 
kilowatt-hour the past eight months to about eight cents, depending on the 
price of five-year natural-gas contracts the generators can sign. The plants 
that run on renewable resources would be paid 5.4 cents a kilowatt-hour.

US Natural Gas Prices Fall As Demand Slips In Most Areas

03/06/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- U.S. natural gas physical prices fell Tuesday as demand 
eased, except in the Northeast and Southeast areas of the country, traders 
said. 
Heavy snowstorms in the upper Northeast supported some pricing, as did cooler 
weather in Georgia, the Carolinas and the Florida panhandle.
Some storage buying occurred in Texas ""if they could make it work,"" a trader 
said. 
""It was a pretty uneventful day,"" a Gulf Coast trader said late Tuesday. 
Also, because of the snowstorm in the Northeast, traders had purchased gas 
ahead of time to make up for needed load, he said. 
A scheduled work outage on Enron's Transwestern San Juan lateral in New 
Mexico was completed, and the return of a power plant in California 
alleviated demand in the West, traders said. 
At the Arizona-California border hub, buyers paid around $13-$33 a million 
British thermal units, West Coast traders said, down as much as $15 from 
Monday. 
At PG&E Citygate, prices were mixed, with buyers paying $9.75-$10.65/MMBtu, 
down 25 cents on the bid, up 15 cents on the offer. 
In the Midwest, Chicago Citygate prices fell 7 cents-8 cents to a range of 
$5.42-$5.53/MMBtu. Alliance Pipeline into Chicago traded around 
$5.47-$5.52/MMBtu, down 4 cents to 9 cents from Monday. 
The Nymex April natural gas futures contract settled at $5.315/MMBtu, down 
2.1 cents in a tight, range-bound, uneventful session that started late due 
to bad weather. 
Physical gas prices at the benchmark Henry Hub in south Louisiana ended in a 
range of $5.25-$5.30/MMBtu, down 2 cents-6 cents from Monday. 
Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line at Station 65 deals were made in a similar 
range of $5.26-$5.35/MMBtu, down 2 cents on the bid, unchanged on the offer. 
At Katy in East Texas, buyers paid $5.21-$5.30/MMBtu, down 5 cents-6 cents. 
At Waha, prices fell 9 cents-12 cents to a range of $5.15-$5.30/MMBtu.

"TO:  All EGM and EIM employees affected
FROM: Sally Beck, Managing Director of ENW-Global Risk Management Operations

Last fall, the Enron Wholesale Services organization was created and announced in an organizational memo from Jeff Skilling.  All wholesale companies (Enron Americas, Enron Europe, Enron Global Markets and Enron Industrial Markets) plus Enron Net Works and Enron Global Assets were included in the Enron Wholesale Services umbrella.  In that organizational memo, the Energy Operations team (now Global Risk Management Operations) was moved into Enron Net Works to align our operational services, information technology and e:commerce platforms in order to offer the best quality services to Enron wholesale customers.  This alignment also positions us to evaluate the prospect of packaging these services for other customers as well.  With this reorganization, we continue to maintain dedicated operations teams that support each of the wholesale businesses.

Since this reorganization occurred so close to year end, I suggested that we wait until January 1, 2001 to move employees under Enron Net Works.  Senior management, accounting and HR agreed with this date for effecting the move to Enron Networks.  Unfortunately, however, the January conversion to Networks did not get fully executed.  

To correct this, effective April 01, 2001, all EGM and EIM  employees  and non-employees who provide risk management operations services and ultimately report in to Brent Price and Brenda Herod, respectively, will be transferred to ENW - Global Risk Management Operations under  company 083E.   Starting April 1st, you should start using new cost centers for coding and timekeeping purposes.  This will formalize the ENW-Global Risk Management Operations' structure.

There are some direct effects that surround the conversion to Enron Net Works. Because you are transferring between Enron payroll companies, IRS requirements state that FICA withholding must start over.  This applies only to the OASDI (6.2%) which has a maximum wage base withholding of $80,400.00 for 2001.  Medicare tax withholding of 1.45% has no cap and therefore does not start over but continues as usual.

The excess OASDI withholding that you incur for the year will credit to you on your 2001 tax return as withholding.  Therefore, to alleviate the burden of starting over, you can adjust your Federal income tax withholding down by filing a new Form W-4 and claim additional allowances which will reduce the withholding to adjust for the excess OASDI withholding.  Be sure to ask your tax advisor what additional steps you can take to balance out these changes.  You may also contact the Payroll Department @ 713/345-5555 to assist you with any questions.  

We will continue to have dedicated HR reps who will work directly with you and your team and who will coordinate among themselves to share best practices that can positively impact all teams.  If you have questions, please call the HR representative who supports your organization, as identified below relative to the business unit to which your team is dedicated:

"Michael is still running 102 fever.  I spoke to the doctor again today, and 
he said that Michael had a pretty good bit of strep.  I'm feeling better, 
though, and have gotten a decent amount of work done.  In fact, Christy 
Chapman may give you some original documents I initialled and faxed to her.  
I'll explain later.  If I had your fax number I think I would have faxed them 
to you.

Have a great day tomorrow.

Not yet.  Karen called me after I sent her my e-mail regarding the several 
missing items and she assured me she would take care of the acknowledgments.  
I did not want to mention it in my e-mail to her yesterday (thought I would 
save that until I had a chance to see if she sent anything to Fred and he is 
out of town).  I have not forgotten about it though.

How are you and handsome doing?  Feeling any better?  I talked to your other 
son ""Carlos"" today and he was thinking about leaving early to go home 
(something he ate yesterday at Massa's).

OK, guys, based on Adnan's information from the counterparty, all contracts 
under Northern Illinois Gas Company will be changed (via name overlay) to 
Nicor Gas Company once Adnan has received the proper name change 
documentation.   Since no changes have been made in GCP to correct the HQ 
company and trade name relationships, the recent ISDA contract was set up 
under Nicor Gas Company.  Once these changes are made in GCP, the contract 
can be changed to the trade name if still needed at that time.

I apologize for all the confusion and hope this helps all parties concerned.

Thanks,
Stacey

Subject: Re: Northern Illinois Gas Company/Nicor Gas Company  

Per my conversation with Nicor Gas Company's attorney, Northern Illinois Gas 
Company changed its name to Nicor Gas Company. Therefore, Nicor Gas Company 
is the only entity that all the deals needs to be booked under. However, the 
attorney also agreed to the fact that they do use the name ""Northern Illinois 
Gas Company d/b/a Nicor Gas Company"" eversince the name change happened. He 
said they had been using both names ""contractually"" and interchangeably even 
though it is all just ONE company, one state registered company.

I'm currently waiting on name change documents, however this is what it looks 
like thats going to happen:
The main HQ company would end up being NICOR GAS COMPANY with all the 
trades/contracts/deals being merged into one record. However, if need be we 
could have a Tradename set up as ""Northern Illinois Gas Company d/b/a Nicor 
Gas Company"" since this is how the company does business as, in some cases.

Nicor's legal Dept could be reached at (630) 983-8676 for any further 
clarifications in this matter.

Subject: Northern Illinois Gas Company/Nicor Gas Company

There appears to be confusion over who and what products we should be trading 
with these entities.

We have an ISDA Master Agreement in place with Northern Illinois Gas Company 
d/b/a Nicor Gas Company.  This is a new master.  If the counterparty is not 
set up this way it need to be.

Physical gas has a master in place with Northern Illinois Gas Company.

There is no master agreement in place with Nicor Gas Company and the only 
trading being done with this entity is online gas trading.

The issue that needs to be resolved is whether we want to trade gas under 
both Northern Illinois Gas Company and Nicor Gas Company.  Frank Davis will 
resolve this issue with Tom Moran in Credit and Stacy Dickson with physical 
gas Legal, and they will let us know who we should be trading with.

When we hear back from them we can finally resolve what counterparty names we 
want to set up and get back to the counterparty if we have not received the 
correct Password Application to match out intended trading partners.

Sorry for all the confusion this is causing.  I am confused too.

"Thanks, Jeanne.

Just to be clear (since we had a bit of a different take last Friday in the meeting that Jim and Sue and I had with Mike).  Mike's take was that we'd be addressing just about everything under the sun, including why we think that hearings are necessary.  This takes a much narrower approach.  Just want to make sure that we're all on the same page.  I understand that Mike was travelling yesterday and the first part of today.  Likely makes sense to have a call this PM to make sure out ducks are all in a line.  Thanks again.

between HoustonStreet.Com and Enron and QuickQuote.com and Enron.   In 90 
days, HoustonStreet.Com and QuickQuote.com will be offering products offered 
on EOL.

I solicit comments from everyone.

As I understand it, a party wishing to trade gas and power can log onto 
HoustonStreet.Com and  deals offered on EOL will 
magically appear. The party might think, ""Hey, I can't do better than this on 
EOL, I'll take this deal"".  The deal is transacted   
and HoustonStreet.Com number is assigned.  As soon as the ""Do the Deal""  
button is clicked, the transaction is sent to EOL where
it is validated.  An EOL deal number is assigned but as far as the party 
doing the deal is concerned, the deal is a HoustonStreet.Com deal.

In the case of a gas deal,  the deal will be bridged to both Sitara and 
TAGG.  The deal at this point would have four deal numbers:

  HoustonStreet.Com Deal #
  EOL Deal #
  Sitara Deal #
  TAGG Deal #

Based on the meeting, the following requirements surfaced.  If you are in 
TAGG,  you should be able to access the deal using
HoustonStreet.Com  Deal #, or the EOL Deal #, or the TAGG Deal #.

If you are in DCAF II,  you should be able to access the deal using 
HoustonStreet.Com Deal #, or the EOL Deal #, or the Sitara Deal #.

This requirement implies that the capture windows in TAGG and Sitara ( I 
assume ) will need to be changed to capture both
the HoustonStreet.Com Deal # and EOL Deal #.  The TAGG Deal number itself  is 
assigned by the Capture program.

This will require a database change as well as fairly significant ( it was 
assumed that there is only one ""Originating System"")  program modifications 
to TAGG Deal Capture, TAGG Deal Clearing,  DCAF II, and Enpower Autoconfirm ( 
clears Power deals ).

Now for some issues:

1) Who is the internal party on the deal that is to appear on the 
confirmation?  Will a HoustonStreet.Com and
 a QuickQuote internal party be set up in Global Counterparty?  

 There are implications for Global Counterparty since all address information 
is set up based on who the external party is doing business with.

 In other words, if there are new internal parties, the address information 
set up for these same external  parties that do trades on EOL will
 have to be set up again for doing business with the new internal parties.

2) Is the confirm to sport a HoustonStreet.Com logo and a QuickQuote.com logo?

3) Who is to sign the confirmation letters when signatures are required?

4) Contract numbers will have to be set up just as they are for trading under 
EOL.  But who are the contracts between?  If
 new internal parties are set up for HoustonStreet.Com and QuickQuote.com, 
then contracts will have to be set up
 between the new internal parties.  But since a HoustonStreet.Com deal goes 
through EOL, how will the appropriate
 contract be assigned?; i.e., if Koch does a deal through HoustonStreet.Com, 
is  a different contract assigned 
 in EOL versus if Koch does the deal through EOL itself?

Tom - I will try and get a USD accounting entity set up in SAP that rolls up to 
ECTEF Inc for legal purposes 

I'm fairly sure we can do this as 54R (ECTRL Global Divisions) is a $ accounting entity of 
138 (ECTRL), a ? entity

Raj - do you have a problem from a tax perspective of having this set up?

Importance:	High

It will mean doing the paperwork all over again and closing the old account assuming ECTEF does not want an account.  This is not a name change but actually a transfer from one entity to another.  It will likely require resolutions to open brokerage accounts for ECTMI if they don't already have them in place.

Aside from looking foolish to Bear I anticipate no hassles from them.  As far as our side it would be wise to have legal give their estimation of the effort and time frame needed to duplicate the effort that was made for ECTMI.

Sara how feasible would it be to prepare account paperwork for the ECTMI company to obtain a Bear account?

Thanks,

Tom

After speaking with David Wall about which entity the Anker debt and equity should be moved to, I placed a few quick phone calls.  I understand that there may be some confusion about what is an investment company, and which ones are available.

The ENA transaction support team suggested ECTMI (Enron Capital Trade Merchant Investments) as one possibility.  There may be another US investment company and an investment company set up in the Netherlands.  The people to follow up with would be Faith Killen and/or Elaine Shields who work in ECT accounting.

I hope this helps you identify where to move the investments.  Please keep me updated on the completion of that move.  AA will be sensitive to us making that transfer into the investment company in the quarter that we have booked earnings on the investment(s) as merchant investments.  As discussed with David Wall, that is consistent with Enron's corporate policy on merchant investments and with the Investment Company Audit Guide which governs our merchant investment accounting.

If you have any further questions or if I can be of further assistance, please contact me at ext. 35882.

Hope all is going well and moving forward.  What always kept me going was the 
idea that in a few days or a week it would all be over and I wanted to be 
able to look back and feel that I had given the best effort I could.  That's 
all you can do.  It is typically more than enough to do very well in grades.  
I will quit preaching now and let you get back to work.  

No big plans for the Easter Weekend.  Will be here in Houston.  I actually

look at his resume, is already with Enron as an Associate.  His e:mail to

Hi Allan:

I  am  writing  you  to express my strong interest in working at Enron Net 
Works
International Private Equity.  I am confident that my experience has prepared 
me
with  the  broad  skills  and finance expertise necessary for success in 
Private
Equity.

The rigorous curriculum in the Anderson School at UCLA has not only confirmed 
my
interest in Finance, but also enhanced my accounting skills. After 
graduation, I
spent  the first four months of my rotation program in Enron at the Asia 
Pacific
Structuring  Group. There I honed my analytical skills, commercial knowledge 
and
cross-functional team experience through financial modeling and risk 
assessment.
I  provided  robust  analytical  support that resulted in a successful bid 
for a
$550  million  power  project in China.  In the past five months at the 
Business
Development   Group  of  Enron  Broadband  Services,  I  managed  the  
strategic
relationship  between  Enron  and  Microsoft. The deal management tasks 
required
broad-based   problem-solving   skills,   effective   communication  and  
strong
understanding  of  the technology market. Recently I also proposed and led a 
new
initiative in developing broadband online gaming content for the Enron 
streaming
media business.

I  have  attached  my resume which details my accomplishments. I look forward 
to
speaking with you and further discuss my credentials in a personal interview.

Raymond James Energy Stat of the Week, published 5/28/2002.

Over the past several weeks, numerous analysts' reports have suggested
there has been a massive destruction of gas demand, as gas prices have
recently moved above $3.50/mcf. We believe the foundation for many of these
reports is both poor analytical methodology and bad data. To conclude that
weather-adjusted natural gas demand has fallen by 5 to 10 bcf per day
implies a demand deterioration level similar to what we saw in early 2001,
when prices soared to near $10 per mcf. Unlike then, today's fuel-switching
incentives still favor natural gas. Secondly, there is little economic
incentive for today's industrial consumers of natural gas to shut down
plants in an improving economic environment. The current economy is very
different than the deteriorating economic environment in early 2001.

3.  Litigation and Other Contingencies

 Enron is a party to various claims and litigation, the significant items o=
f=20
which are discussed below.  Although no assurances can be given, Enron=20
believes, based on its experience to date and after considering appropriate=
=20
reserves that have been established, that the ultimate resolution of such=
=20
items, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse=
=20
impact on Enron=01,s financial position or its results of operations.
 Litigation.  In 1995, several parties (the Plaintiffs) filed suit in Harri=
s=20
County District Court in Houston, Texas, against Intratex Gas Company=20
(Intratex), Houston Pipe Line Company and Panhandle Gas Company=20
(collectively, the Enron Defendants), each of which is a wholly-owned=20
subsidiary of Enron.  The Plaintiffs were either sellers or royalty owners=
=20
under numerous gas purchase contracts with Intratex, many of which have=20
terminated.  Early in 1996, the case was severed by the Court into two=20
matters to be tried (or otherwise resolved) separately.  In the first matte=
r,=20
the Plaintiffs alleged that the Enron Defendants committed fraud and=20
negligent misrepresentation in connection with the =01&Panhandle program,=
=018 a=20
special marketing program established in the early 1980s.  This case was=20
tried in October 1996 and resulted in a verdict for the Enron Defendants.  =
In=20
the second matter, the Plaintiffs allege that the Enron Defendants violated=
=20
state regulatory requirements and certain gas purchase contracts by failing=
=20
to take the Plaintiffs=01, gas ratably with other producers=01, gas at cert=
ain=20
times between 1978 and 1988.  The trial court certified a class action with=
=20
respect to ratability claims.  On March 9, 2000, the Texas Supreme Court=20
ruled that the trial court=01,s class certification was improper and remand=
ed=20
the case to the trial court.  The Enron Defendants deny the Plaintiffs=01,=
=20
claims and have asserted various affirmative defenses, including the statut=
e=20
of limitations.  The Enron Defendants believe that they have strong legal a=
nd=20
factual defenses, and intend to vigorously contest the claims.  Although no=
=20
assurances can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of the=
se=20
matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position o=
r=20
results of operations.

 On November 21, 1996, an explosion occurred in or around the Humberto Vida=
l=20
Building in San Juan, Puerto Rico.  The explosion resulted in fatalities,=
=20
bodily injuries and damage to the building and surrounding property.  San=
=20
Juan Gas Company, Inc. (San Juan), an Enron subsidiary, operated a=20
propane/air distribution system in the vicinity.  Although San Juan did not=
=20
provide service to the building, the National Transportation Safety Board=
=20
(NTSB) concluded that the probable cause of the incident was propane leakin=
g=20
from San Juan=01,s distribution system.  San Juan and Enron strongly disagr=
ee. =20
The NTSB found no path of migration of propane from San Juan=01,s system to=
 the=20
building and no forensic evidence that propane fueled the explosion.  Enron=
,=20
San Juan, and four San Juan affiliates have been named, along with several=
=20
third parties, as defendants in numerous lawsuits filed in U.S. District=20
Court for the district of Puerto Rico and the Superior Court of Puerto Rico=
. =20
These suits, which seek damages for wrongful death, personal injury, busine=
ss=20
interruption and property damage, allege that negligence of Enron, San Juan=
=20
and its affiliates, among others, caused the explosion.  Enron, San Juan an=

s=20
can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters=
=20
will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or result=

of operations.

 Trojan Investment Recovery.  In early 1993, PGE ceased commercial operatio=
n=20
of Trojan.  In April 1996 a circuit court judge in Marion County, Oregon,=
=20
found that the OPUC could not authorize PGE to collect a return on its=20
undepreciated investment in Trojan, contradicting a November 1994 ruling fr=
om=20
the same court.  The ruling was the result of an appeal of PGE=01,s March 1=
995=20
general rate order which granted PGE recovery of, and a return on, 87% of i=
ts=20
remaining investment in Trojan.  The 1994 ruling was appealed to the Oregon=
=20
Court of Appeals and was stayed pending the appeal of the OPUC=01,s March 1=
995=20
order.  Both PGE and the OPUC separately appealed the April 1996 ruling,=20
which appeals were combined with the appeal of the November 1994 ruling at=
=20
the Oregon Court of Appeals.  On June 24, 1998, the Court of Appeals of the=
=20
State of Oregon ruled that the OPUC does not have the authority to allow PG=
E=20
to recover a rate of return on its undepreciated investment in the Trojan=
=20
generating facility.  The court upheld the OPUC=01,s authorization of PGE=
=01,s=20
recovery of its undepreciated investment in Trojan.

 PGE and the OPUC each filed petitions for review with the Oregon Supreme=
=20
Court.  On August 26, 1998, the Utility Reform Project filed a petition for=
=20
review with the Oregon Supreme Court seeking review of that portion of the=
=20
Oregon Court of Appeals decision relating to PGE=01,s recovery of its=20
undepreciated investment in Trojan.  On April 29, 1999, the Oregon Supreme=
=20
Court accepted the petitions for review.  On June 16, 1999, Oregon House Bi=
ll=20
3220 authorizing the OPUC to allow recovery of a return on the undepreciate=
d=20
investment in property retired from service was signed.  One of the effects=
=20
of the bill is to affirm retroactively the OPUC=01,s authority to allow PGE=
=01,s=20
recovery of a return on its undepreciated investment in the Trojan generati=
ng=20
facility.

 Relying on the new legislation, on July 2, 1999, PGE requested the Oregon=
=20
Supreme Court to vacate the June 24, 1998, adverse ruling of the Oregon Cou=
rt=20
of Appeals, affirm the validity of the OPUC=01,s order allowing PGE to reco=
ver a=20
return on its undepreciated investment in Trojan and to reverse its decisio=
n=20
accepting the Utility Reform Project=01,s petition for review.  The Utility=

proceeding, opposed such request and submitted to the Oregon Secretary of=

State sufficient signatures in support of placing a referendum to negate th=
e=20
new legislation on the November 2000 ballot.  The Oregon Supreme Court has=

indicated it will defer hearing the matter until after the November 2000=20

 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has informed Enron that it is a=

=20
Site (the Decorah Site) in Decorah, Iowa, pursuant to the provisions of the=
=20
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCL=
A,=20
also commonly known as Superfund).  The manufactured gas plant in Decorah=

ceased operations in 1951.  A predecessor company of Enron purchased the=20
Decorah Site in 1963.  Enron=01,s predecessor did not operate the gas plant=

sold the Decorah Site in 1965.  The EPA alleges that hazardous substances=

were released to the environment during the period in which Enron=01,s=20
predecessor owned the site, and that Enron=01,s predecessor assumed the=20
liabilities of the company that operated the plant.  Enron contests these=
=20
allegations.  To date, the EPA has identified no other potentially=20
responsible parties with respect to this site.  Under the terms of=20
administrative orders, Enron replaced affected topsoil and removed impacted=
=20
subsurface soils in certain areas of the tract where the plant was formerly=
=20
located.  Enron completed the final removal actions at the site in November=

1998 and concluded all remaining site activities in the spring of 1999. =20

Subject: PSEG Request

Kay:

I talked with PSEG this morning.  PSEG would like to negotiate and sign a 
binding LOI regarding the Kendall project site in Illinois prior to 
negotiating and executing the Definitive SPA.  The specifics of this LOI are:

 PSEG would pay an up-front $300,000 payment to ENA 
 This payment would be non-refundable unless PSEG discovered a ""fatal flaw"" 
in the project (we will have to carefully define this concept)
 The binding LOI would establish a date by which the SPA would be executed or 
PSEG would forfeit the up-front payment
 The $2.7 MM balance of the Purchase Price would be due upon closing (signing 
the SPA and transferring the member interests).

I believe that PSEG is getting nervous that we may close on the Kendall LLC 
with another Buyer before they get their act together.

Call me to discuss the timing of drafting such an LOI.  I would like to 
strike on PSEG while they are anxious and motivated.  My goal is to send the 
LOI to PSEG by Wednesday of this week.  I can work directly with Carolyn if 
that is the most efficient approach.

Melissa,

Please, take a look at this resume. Any interest?
I got it from a headhunter (I don't know her,
it was a cold call on her part and she did not make a good impression).

Hi there Mr. Kaminski! It was a pleasure to speak with you today. I look

forward to lunch one day soon at Brennans.

Wayne Tow is a brilliant man, He worked for many years for a man I know
well.  This man says, Wayne is as good as it get, and he could do
anything that is assigned to him, and do it at  a level in which he was
always amazed.
He loves the E-commerce area, and this is what he wants to do
Thank you, Vince.

"Greetings:

Hope everyone had a pleasant 4th.

I've read the respective Burton and Hertzberg language on amending AB 1X.  The Burton language looks cleaner and simpler, though there may be reasons to include some of the Hertzberg language, too.

I'm proposing to the group the following as potential amendments to the bond bill.  I would appreciate your feedback.  The amendments would be as follows:

Customers who were on Direct Access when DWR started buying power (Jan. 17th?), and are still on Direct Access when the bill passes, should be exempt from paying for the bonds. 

In short, customers should not be forced to pay for power twice--once from their ESP, and once from DWR.  Since these customers receive power services from their ESP, they never consumed DWR power in the first place and it wouldn't be fair to require them to pay for it.

Customers who have been utility customers since DWR started buying power but subsequently switched to Direct Access should only pay for power provided by DWR that they actually consumed, no more and no less.  

For example, if a customer was a utility customer when DWR started buying power but switched to Direct Access on May 1st, then the customer would only be responsible for reimbursing DWR for power deliveries that took place from Jan. 17th thru April 30th.

I believe that we agreed on these concepts during the negotiations that took place over the past 4-5 weeks.  Or if we didn't explicitly agree during the talks, they seem to be principles on which we ought to be able to agree pretty easily now. And rather than leave the issue hanging, which can create unnecessary and costly uncertainty for customers, I suggest that we include very clear and simple legislative language in the bond bill clarifying what customers' obligations are.  Your thoughts are appreciated.

In addition, we have talked quite a bit about providing customers with incentives in the attempt to get California out of the energy hole that it finds itself in.  Providing (20KW and above) customers with an incentive to switch to Direct Access as soon as possible could 1) reduce the net short position that the state (and ultimately consumers) have to finance, thereby reducing spot purchases and price volatility,  2) reduce electricity purchasing costs, and 3) reduce the burden on the state budget.

With this in mind, I'm also proposing that the group consider an amendment to the bond bill that would exempt from bond charges any customer that switches to Direct Access by September 1st.

Finally, it seems odd that the language directing the PUC to suspend Direct Access is still in the bill.  If a dedicated rate component is created, that seems to eliminate altogether the need to suspend Direct Access.  And if that's the case, would it make sense to delete that language from the bill?

Look forward to your comments and working with you to get support for and passage of the ""core/noncore"" proposal.

Best,
Jeff"
"Help me...I don't understand this LME Contract.  Mark says that even though 
we trade it on EOL and the trade is still done directly with us, it is still 
considered an LME contract, and not a lookalike.  I think I might need to 
talk to you about this tomorrow, because I'm confused.

Also, I am getting a lot of calls from the MG people in New York about 
pursuing metals counterparties, and I think we need to figure out whether 
they should be talking to Houston or London Legal...I'm not sure who their 
lawyers should be...also, the online team here in Houston is pursuing their 
business, and it's not clear to me if I should also be having them call you 
about potential metals customers?

Anyway, when I get in can I give you a call?

Also, I left a voicemail for your assistant, I'm trying to track down 
Edmund's address so I can send him a gift, but no response?  Do you know when 
he'll be back, or how I can get in touch with him?"
"The place (outside) is a mess and needs some clean-up (e.g., get all that old 
wood out of the front yard, whack down the weeds).  Possible for you guys to 
come up next Wednesday night and we can do a quick clean up on Thursday.  I'm 
going to try to hire a hauling company to help us and haul it away.  If 
Cameron has to work are you available?

Best,
Jeff"
"Bob,
 Can you determine from the attached if we have a current deal to amend, or 
is this simply a new deal under the Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement.?

"In the Senate:
Today the Senate passed out of committee SB18XX and is expected to pass the 
bill out of the full Senate sometime today.  
The bill would de-link 1) payment for bonds issued to repay General Fund 
dollars used to buy power from 2) payment for power contracts signed by DWR.
The Senate has thus far failed to get its version of the ""Edison MOU"" 
(SB78XX) out the necessary committees in order to get it to the floor for a 
vote by the full Senate.  
It is unclear at this point whether the Senate will try to vote the MOU bill 
out of the Senate, or focus solely on SB18XX (de-linking bonds from DWR 
contracts) prior to leaving for vacation.
Dunn got a resolution passed that permits his investigative committee to take 
depositions of individuals.

In the Assembly:
The Assembly has thus far failed to get an ""MOU"" (82XX or 83XX) voted out of 
the full Assembly, though expectations are that the Hertzberg bill (82XX) 
will get voted out of the Assembly today."

Do you think the production gas can be moved to EES's pool by July 1st?  If 
not, we can sell the gas to Latrove out of CES's pool for July.  However, we 
will not see the fuel credit until August(???) to verify if this works or not.

Subject: Re: Peoples  

Questions that I have:
1)  I am assuming that the Clinton end-user will not go into EESs' pool.  It 
needs to be verified with PNG that I can do a pool to pool nomination to the 
end-user (only a few stand alone customers are grandfathered to receive these 
types of noms.)  This is a critical issue for EES as we are already long gas 
behind the gate and we don't need more production.  If the customer can't 
take my gas from my pool then I will have to bring it in via CNG which will 
only make my pool longer.

2)  If the production meters are moved to EESs' pool then I would suggest 
just a flat index price between ENA and EES.

3)  Will EES be supplying the full 1000/d to the end-user or just the amount 
of the local production transferred to EESs' pool?  

4)  If the fuel credit works the way Chris explains it below then I would be 
willing to sell all of the gas at index but I will need to confirm that with 
PNG.

Subject: Re: Peoples  

1. ENA is responsible for purchases of 500 MCFD (515 DthD) Metered Prouction 
from Phillips Production Company.  This volume is will be decreased  until 
further notice because PNG has increased line pressures thus reducing the 
production volumes to 50-60% of normal (Refer to attached schedule).  There 
are 7 Phillips meters  in CES's pool beginning July 2000.  Heidi Boyd @ CES 
will have to nominate the production into CES's pool and away from the pool 
until the meters are moved.  EES should have 6 Phillips Production meters in 
their pool beginning July 2000.

2.  See Attached Schedule for Term, Price & Volume.  


Note:  PNG has increased line pressures which reduces production into the 
system.  Both Phillips Production and Power Gas Marketing are claiming Force 
Majeure.  Their volumes have been reduced to 50-60% of the original contractd 
volume.

that can take around 1,000 day.  I don't know if that's dt or mcf.  I will 
use mcf for this email until someone corrects me.  This customer has a 
special deal where the pool operator gets a fuel credit on every mcf the 
customer pulls.  For July, assuming the gathering fuel is 5%, and this 
customer pulls 95 mcf from your production pool, you will get a 5 mcf 
credited back to your imbalance account the following month.  I don't know 
how this works with trading imbalances.  But, at a NYMX of $3.95 that works 
out to $.21 - sounds good to me.  Paul said this customer is looking for a 
CNG Index Flat price or and equivalent basis number.  Marde will not sell at 
that price but I will.

Marde said she would charge ENA a $.03 fee for all the volumes flowing.  
Actually, I would prefer to move all the pool and production gas to EES, 
settle up financially with EES and be done with it.  What we could do to test 
Paul's statement, is have the customer pull 300 mcf/day out of CES's pool for 
July.  It would be easy to see since that is the only deal.   AND, have EES 
take over the pool deal with Power Gas Marketing.  Comments / Questions?

Questions
John
1.  Heidi (EES) said you already have some Phillips production in EES's 
pool.  Does CES still have metered production from Phillips in CES's pool?  
If yes, how many meters?

2.  Please give me the following info for the activity behind Peoples
  Phillips   Power Gas Marketing
Term
Price
Volume

Heidi (EES)
If we find out from John that there is still metered production in CES's 
pool, please call Peoples and see if we can move the metered production to 
EES's pool for July.  Heidi Boyd with CES said you could tell them that CES 
is going out of business and they may make exceptions for that.

Marde
I would prefer to move both supply customers over to EES, where EES makes the 
payments and bills either Clinton or Clinton's customer.  At what price will 
you take these deals?  I assume we need to get this info from John before you 
can anwser this.

As of today, Power Gas Marketing volume has decreased from 7,500 per month to 
4,000 per month, until further notice, due to Peoples regulating the volume 
of production into their system.

Phillips Production is also down..

For July, I would sell 4, 000 per month supplied by Power Gas Marketing (pool 
to pool), and 300 MCFD x 1.03 = 309 Dth/day metered production from Phillips 
Production.  The Phillips Production meters are in CES's pool.  It will cost 
$100 per transaction to do a pool to pool transfer.  If Paul Leanza can use 
the gas through November, we should move the Phillips meters to his pool 
(309/Day).  The Power Gas volumes go through October.

"Tanya:
When the Columbia purchase was done in January, did the 1/30/98 ISDA Master 
between ENA and Columbia Energy Services Corporation stay with Columbia or 
come over to us?  The reason that I am asking is that they have sent ENA a 
letter notifying us of Columbia's transfer of its rights under such Master to 
The New Power Company, so it seems as if they believe that that Master was 
not part of our acquisition.  Who in credit needs to be aware of this if in 
fact this Master will be assigned to New Power?

"Good morning.

I didn't wake Paige up this am.  I told Michael he could wake her up when he 
wanted to, which I presume didn't take long.

It feels good to be back.  Last week really wasn't a very good week to take 
off, and I was really stressed. It helps knowing that I have a holiday in two 
weeks!  I'm glad, since Michael is off then as well.

Did you make friends with your venison (or was is pork)?

Greetings
A step in the right direction- the CDWR paid their bill in full for the
February 2001 trade month.

The ISO will be disbursing the dollars a week from today.  One other
important highlight is that the ISO invoiced the DWR for all charges
associated with meeting the net short of the utilities and they did pay in
full- we were expecting they would make only a partial payment. I'm glad we
were wrong.  We can now hold our breath for the rest of the $$.  Please give
me a call with any questions

Subject: EnronCredit Move

John, I need your help again.  Jeff Kinneman's group on level 30 is wanting 
to move to level 14.  There are several problems with this move.


1.  This group utilizes the IPC turrets and the 14th floor is not wired to 
support them.
 a.  The cabling for each station is very costly ($1000 per desk).
 b.  Our Telecom Room does not have enough rack space to handle any more 
cabling for the turrets.
  There is simply not enough closet space for additional 12 pair cabling
 c.  AMP, the vender that makes the 12 pair connectors, are no longer 
manufacturing the connectors needed for the 12 pair cables.
  The vender will be making a special run to make more of them for Enron in 
late December.
  Hopefully, they will make enough to last until June of 2001.

2.  This group also utilizes the Stentofon and Amtel Systems.
 a.  Again this floor is not wired to support these devices.

3.  The Response Time would be affected.
 a.  The Trading Floor Support Team is located on level 31, near the ENA 
trading floors.
  A team of only three supports all Enron's IPC phones, Recording channels, 
Stentofons and Amtels on the Trading Floors.
  Team members would have to use two elevator banks, instead of the stairs 
for one or two floors, before they could be on site for this group.
 b.  We now have three other Trading Floors that we support that are not on 
Levels 30, 31 or 32 and one more would hurt us even more.
  The groups are EBS, EES and Bridgeline.

4.  There is no UPS power for that floor; so their computer systems would be 
susceptible to power outages.


I am not sure what the reason(s) are behind this business unit wanting to 
move to level 14, but I have an alternative plan.  Level 29 has been 
completely cabled out with 12-pair cables for the IPC Tradenet phones and is 
also cabled for Stentofons and Amtels.  This floor has been built out with 
Trading Desk furniture as well.

My suggestion is to have this group relocate to level 29 instead of level 14; 
this will save the company both money and time.  Your help is needed to 
convince Jeff's group to move to level 29 instead of 14.

Any help that you can provide would be appreciated.

Thanks,

and price situation at a recent conference held by the Interstate Oil and Gas 
Compact Commission, and some of the best graphs came from work that Stinson 
and Hector did (see the attached, slides #11, #12, #14, & #15).




I really appreciate their research and hope to be able to use their talents 
again for presentations for the Office of the Chairman..

I think Marta is referring to the supply deal 391119 on 9/6 for 10,545.  We 
do not have a price of GD + $0.04.  We have IF + $0.04.  Please check this

for the generous amount of time you spent with me personally while I was
there.  I found our discussions both informative and stimulating.

    Vince, I was genuinely impressed by the caliber of the group you have
assembled at Enron.  Their individual and collective expertise is obvious;
and they were most generous in exchanging ideas and sharing opinions with me.

    If you or any of your people have, over the weekend, developed further
questions or thought of additional information that might be helpful, I'm
standing by.  I'm eager to continue our dialogue.


    Sincerely,

Barclays call on the guarantee. If they think about it then they probably

guaranteed....we could send out the first draft though and see if they raise
the issue of the guarantee. Do you want to raise the question of

out (a
spot transaction I believe) but will then receive pounds income which it
will
need to convert to dollars to pay interest on the bonds.

The precedent document is the Sutton Bridge currency swap.

Can you please confirm you have been instructed and let us know your timing
for
issuing a document.  The sooner we can see this next week the better.

The bond trustee will as usual require the swap to be backed with legal
opinions
from Enron in-house counsel (Mark Haedicke) re due execution and from V&E
(Terry
Yates) re enforceability. My understanding is that the swap will not be
guaranteed by Corp (correct Julian?).

Linklaters are representing Enron - Julian Davies and Fran Xavier (tel: 171
456
2000). Could you please send them your fax, telephone and email details.
Linklaters have kindly agreed to prepare a first draft of the Mark Haedicke
opinion and to send it out to you Sara.

Thank  you. I look forward to hearing from you.


                         Mark

John,

Here are the simulations for:

Normal roll:  (same as before, but included for completeness)
No Roll: (liquidate position at end of each month)
Roll to fill price gap

I have included in place of the Roll P/L, the cumulative price gap over all the contract rolls ($/bbl).   Negative value means a backwardated market.


Normal Roll	No Roll		Fill Gap

   



Will send the same set of runs for 2nd last day later this morning.

Subject: help with neighborhood

Steve,

I am having a problem with the drainage in our easements in my neighborhood 
and Kevin Hannon suggested I email you.  I live in Garden Oaks (which is 
located off of the 610 North Loop between Shepherd and Yale near the 
Heights).  Our neighborhood was built in the early 1940's, and the city put 
in open drainage (which is basically ditches in the front of all the 
properties).  Over the past 60 years the drains have filled in and leveled 
which is preventing the water from flowing correctly to the sewers, and this 
in turn causes minor flooding and BIG headaches.  

My address is 236 W. 30th Street and the area of 30th Street I am asking the 
city to regrade is between Ashland and Yale (approximately 2,500 feet).  I 
have been calling the City of Houston Public Works Department 713-247-1000 
for about the last 4 years (generally once a month) to ask them to please 
come out and regrade our ditches.  (The Public Works Department only has 
records over the last year because they changed their computer system and 
lost many files including mine.)  For the last year or so I have been 
receiving a more positive response when I call which is: ""This is a Code 1 
priority and will schedule as work load allows.""  Although this response is 
encouraging, I still feel that my request is falling on deaf ears.  

Kevin suggested that perhaps a call or letter to a city council person might 
help expedite this work request.  I would be extremely grateful if there is 
anything you could do to help me and my neighbors.

Edmund - 

I have reviewed the long descriptions I was given for the credit derivatives 
(I can't tell if they are current) and have substantial comments - I have 
attached what I have come up with (sorry it's in 2 pieces).  Basically I 
don't think we should be restating something in the Long Description that is 
already covered (sometimes with different language) in the GTC - this only 
creates an ambiguity and is not necessary to form a complete contract.  My 
other concern - and I have not been able to draft language to fix it - is 
that I can't find any definition of the Seller Payment amount and I don't 
think the Buyer Payment language works  -  can you give me a call so we can 
discuss my concerns?

Hi John,

I'm attaching the current draft of the contract under which we will be able
to buy the Fuel Cell equipment for use on projects in Connecticut.  The
contract will likely be a Connecticut law contract.  Could you have someone
give it a fatal flaw check, or should I use Connecticut counsel?

One issue which is nagging me is their request for a security interest in
the equipment, as I think this might complicate financing.  I assume that
an equipment supplier has certain lien rights under Connecticut law anyway.
Can you have this verified?  I only want the simplest of explanations.

Thanks,

European Gas CERA Alert: Signposts to a High Demand Path for Natural Gas: The 
Large Combustion Plant Directive and German Nuclear Phaseout

Abstract 
Two unrelated developments at the end of June both point in the direction of 
a long-term high demand growth path for natural gas in Europe, consistent 
with CERA's Blue Gold scenario. Both the approval of the Large Combustion 
Plant Directive by EU environment ministers and the agreement on German 
nuclear phaseout between the German government and industry could involve the 
early removal of existing, low-cost generating plants from the European power 
capital stock in the 2010-15 time period and their subsequent replacement by 
natural gas-fired turbines.

"Ashley,

I agree with you. Two trips are the best solution, unless of course Shmuel 
rearranges
the speaker list and the 16th will work for the presentation as well. 

Coordinating so many different events is never easy. Thanks for your
patience.

Vince,

Actually, the General Presentation that I have scheduled for the Faculty Club 
(a dining/meeting room) on campus is set for 7:00 p.m. - 9:00 p.m. on Monday 
the 16th.    I can attempt to change the presentation date again, however I 
feel that it would be very unlikely that we are able to get another facility 
that is near campus.  At this point it may be better to plan on making two 
seperate trips so that we are able to handle both events.  Maybe we could 
combine another presentation in during the same visit.  What do you think?

Tana,

Can you let me know if ENA has an ISDA signed with PG&E Energy Trading Power 
L.P.  I am looking at doing a financial swap against the Ontario IMO spot 
price with PG&E and was wondering if it could be done under and existing ISDA

Subject: PennFuture's E-Cubed - Straight to the Source


PennFuture's E-cubed is a commentary biweekly email publication concerning the current themes and trends in the energy market.

September 26, 2001
Vol. 3, No. 18

Straight to the Source

Last year when PECO Energy and Unicom merged to form Exelon it was big news. Importantly, the merger settlement provided $32 million to fund the development of renewable energy in Pennsylvania.

This year, the company's wholesale trading and marketing unit, Power Team, presented renewable energy advocates with a big surprise - signing long-term contracts to purchase the output of three new wind farms in Pennsylvania. These contracts were not required as part of the merger settlement, and are not included in the $32 million earmarked for renewable energy funding.

Now a key force in renewable energy development in the East, the Power Team contracts are essential to bringing 78 MW of generation online from these new wind farms, two of which will be operational next month. The 15 MW Mill Run wind farm is scheduled to being operation next week, and the 9 MW Somerset wind farm is scheduled to begin commercial operation the following week.

Mike Freeman, the Power Team trader who made the burgeoning wind energy business in Pennsylvania possible, gave us some insight into Exelon's renewable energy commitment as well as how wind energy can be integrated into America's power grids.
---------------------------------
What's in Power Team's renewable portfolio?
We have 525 MW of hydro that is not pumped storage, 150 MW of wind, 100 MW of landfill methane, 35 MW of Municipal Solid Waste, 20 MW of wood waste, and 16 MW of scrap tires.

All of the wind is Green-e certifiable as ""new"" resources. All of the landfill methane is qualified under Green-e, but only 10 MW is new generation. Of the hydro, all of the generation is in larger projects that have been or are eligible for certification under the low-impact hydro standards. The MSW and tire projects are not qualified under Green-e, but the biomass plant is. 

Why is Power Team developing a renewable portfolio?
There were two principal reasons: a perceived demand for renewable energy products in the wholesale marketplace, and a desire to diversify our portfolio from the perspectives of fuel, emissions, and cost.

Was there internal resistance or other issues to overcome?
I think the initial reaction was that renewable projects would be a very minor sidelight to our overall business. I don't think many people paid attention to the implications of renewable portfolio standards or external corporate mandates for renewable purchases. Part of the hands-off approach was due to, I believe, a sense that renewable products only meant the re-packaging of existing generation, not changing the power system in any way. 

Over time I think many people got comfortable with the idea that the creation of products potentially could initiate new projects that would change the power system. For me that's the most important part of our participation - to help encourage new development. I also think that management began to get comfortable with the idea that renewable energy products could be profitable, and that demand for these products could be sustaining. 

Will this encourage new development? 
Generators get a creditworthy counter-party that is not only willing to buy all of the energy at the generator location, but is also willing to talk about additional new projects. Over time, other market intermediaries such as power marketers and retail suppliers may become interested in doing the same. If this chain of events occurs, I think we may even see renewable credits traded over the counter, just like other energy products now. 

How do renewables fit into Power Team's overall business strategy?
We are a growth company and are constantly in search of ways to sensibly increase our overall generating portfolio. So bringing on new renewable generation into our supply mix really is part of that overall strategy. More specifically, we believe there is sustainable demand for renewable energy, not only because of mandates such as renewable portfolio standards, but also because of natural demand. The average person may not think of it this way, but in supporting the idea of paying a premium for renewable energy I think that people implicitly are accepting the notion that renewable energy is an essential component of how we as a country intend to manage our future energy requirements.  

Why Wind?
There's no question that the momentum for wind projects began to build as a result of the PECO restructuring and merger settlements, under which PECO provided funds for new wind projects. A second reason is that the forward electric markets began a steep upward climb beginning in 1998, and especially the off-peak power market beginning in 2000 and continuing into this year. A third reason was the rapid increase in electric demand in the last five years, and a realization that we need to develop a wide-ranging set of answers to meeting the demand, including supply-side and demand-side solutions. We felt that wind generation could play a role on the supply side while meeting what seems to be a growing demand for renewable sources. 

What are the primary financial considerations for a wind deal?
The first is probably the need for a long-term contract. Wind generators typically want to enter into fixed-price, long-term agreements to make it easier and cheaper to borrow money and to provide a stable revenue source over a long period. We don't have a problem with long-term deals per se, although we do want to emphasize diversity in our contracting as well. We don't want to hold multiple long-term agreements and nothing else. 

In my discussions with generators so far, there has been some flexibility on contract length. In fact, our willingness to enter into a long-term contract is perhaps the key ingredient to getting a wind project financed and built. Beyond the long-term contract, the wind developers want to do business with a creditworthy company that has an investment-grade rating. Exelon Generation is rated A- by S&P so we are a natural counter-party for project financing. Right now, there are not very many long term buyers out there with the kind of credit-worthiness that we have. 

Will that always will be the case? 
No. If we're right about long-lasting demand, I think other large companies, including distribution companies, will participate in the purchase of energy from these projects. We've teamed up with a retail marketer, Community Energy, to stimulate demand and market wind energy in ways that will move companies to buy it. In the development of conventional generation, it is not always necessary to enter into 20-year agreements for a project to get built. For example, a developer may want to hedge off a portion of the output on a long-term basis but will be willing to sell the rest of the output for shorter periods. And in some cases, the financing source may be comfortable with a shorter-term agreement for the whole thing. 

Is there a financial advantage for wind?  
If one's view is that the future value of energy is higher than the present value, a generation source with no fuel risk obviously is good to have. Wind has one key advantage over other resources - perpetual availability without any fuel costs or price volatility. This helps mitigate the other risks that wind does present. 

It is of course difficult to predict what will happen even in the near term. But I am a believer in broad trends or cycles that are relatively easier to project, outside of significant advances in technology. Over a long period of time, 15 or 20 years, I think the probability of fixed-price wind energy riding out the low cycles while providing a greater amount of benefits in the high cycles is higher than the opposite.

I do believe that the demand for wind generation will be sustained at a moderate premium over generic electricity prices for the next 15 to 20 years. 

Is it difficult to integrate wind into your portfolio?
With conventional generation and firm transmission paths, a power marketing entity such as Power Team can bring its resources to the highest markets, whether they are hourly, daily, monthly, or longer. Such transactions are supported by a complex communications network that notifies transmission providers of the timing, amount and ultimate sink of expected output. 

The contracts that we enter into on conventional generators depend to a great extent on economic structures that ensure as much as possible that the generator will fulfill our dispatch schedule as close to 100% of the time as possible, so we can avoid the punitive imbalance fees that transmission providers impose when delivered energy doesn't match scheduled energy. The approach we take on wind generation must be quite different, because wind plants provide intermittent output that is difficult to predict within reasonable boundaries of accuracy. 

I think the serious wind developers know we are serious about incorporating wind energy into our portfolio. We're one of the biggest physical movers of power in the country and have a significant amount of assets - that must count for something in terms of our ability to more easily integrate a 50 MW wind project into our overall mix.

How does intermittent generation add complexity?
A wind farm generates electricity when the wind blows, not when you flip the switch on. It takes a lot more than I expected to accommodate intermittency, even for an experienced organization like ours, because the transmission system and the operational rules and procedures were not developed with wind generation in mind. You don't have the ability to give transmission providers real-time information for purposes of regulating the system between supply and demand. 

In PJM, where generators can offer increments of generation on a day-ahead or real-time basis, and receive (or pay) market-clearing prices depending on actual generation, wind energy can be offered into the system in one of several different ways without experiencing significant imbalance penalties. An obstacle, and we're working with PJM on this right now, is that PJM as the transmission provider typically requires no shorter than 20-minute notice when self-scheduled or must-run generators expect to produce electricity or expect to stop producing electricity. For purposes of regulating the system, PJM then has the ability to tell the self-scheduled generator to go ahead and generate, or to hold off until the energy is needed as a result of the real-time balance of supply and demand. 

This will not be practical with wind generation. We'd literally have to assign a trader to the task of monitoring highly suspect expected output from our wind plants and then calling PJM every hour to determine what to do. In the must-run scenario, we'd still have to notify PJM of expected output so PJM can regulate the system with other generators. Either way, we'd have to predict output, which is a dicey 
proposition. 

Does that make wind generation unreliable?
Not at all. We've got excellent modeling to predict the output from wind generation over a longer period of time, such as a full year. Those predictions underlie our contracts. But it's another thing to tell the wind when to blow. The wind energy industry is working on this from the perspective of improved wind forecasting and a more automated approach than what I've described. In PJM, a 54,000 MW system, this may not seem to be a problem when there is only about 25 MW of wind generation in the system right now, but PJM wants to institute market rules that will be appropriate for a larger amount of wind generation when it arrives. A certain magnitude of wind generation will cause PJM to change the way it now regulates the system. 

The complexity cannot be underestimated and we will be part of the solution. 

How can scheduling and other rules  better accommodate intermittent resources like wind?
An alternative is for the transmission provider to model the output from a wind plant as ""negative"" load instead of generation. Which is to say, when the plant is generating electricity, the system load will be reduced by the amount the plant is generating. When the plant is not generating, the load will increase. A tradeoff of that approach is that load typically pays ancillary services expenses such as regulation and spinning reserve. In this unique circumstance, which of the ancillary services apply to negative load, and at what level? We're working with PJM on these questions. 

I'm uncertain whether a significant amount of so-called negative load will require any kind of real-time notice to the transmission provider. Of course the transmission systems are operated to react to the unpredictability of load, and one can view the unpredictability of wind generation in the same way. Other countries, and the western U.S. transmission systems, have figured out how to handle large amounts of wind generation, and so can we. 

Are you working on other approaches?
Another possibility is to dynamically schedule the output from a wind plant that is situated in a control area without a real-time energy market, to a control area that does have such a market. The output signal from the plant would be available to the transmission provider in the second control area on an automated basis.  The output then becomes part of available supply from moment to moment. However, notice requirements would not be sidestepped with this approach.

Will PJM resolve these problems?
Yes. PJM is progressive and innovative, and has indicated to us that they are willing to work with us to find solutions to the scheduling/imbalance issue. It's hard now because we're breaking new ground. I expect that it will be much easier for the next projects developed. 

How big might your renewable portfolio get? Will you keep signing more contracts for new projects? 
As long as we continue to see demand for renewable energy, we'll continue to look at projects where there are energy markets whose long-term forward economics support the purchase of energy. I'd like to aggregate a significant amount of wind generation in a single market, such as PJM, to be able to provide PJM with a more diversified supply curve - with multiple projects it may be possible to smooth the output.

We need to do business with companies that have the financing and the organizational will to get these projects completed. We are looking to form relationships with companies that we can build on. If we execute a contract successfully, we'd like to apply the same concepts to additional projects with the same company. Examples of that are Atlantic Renewable Energy Corp. and National Wind Power. 

What are some key developments to make the industry grow faster?
We need technological efficiencies to drive down the cost of the equipment, standardized approaches to the transmission of wind generation, financial innovations to allow more risk-sharing, and hybrid approaches such as wind and energy storage. 

Perhaps most importantly, we need consumers to buy the wind energy!

new price cap methodology.
The new methodology will become effective 11/3/2000 or as soon thereafter as 
can be implemented.  CAISO staff has indicated that it will be difficult to 
achieve that start date.  They have not yet indicated what an achievable date 
might be.
The new price cap methodology will remain in place until:
Comprehensive market changes have been implemented and the market has proven 
to be workably competitive under a variety of load conditions.
Either FERC or the ISO board orders its removal.
Cap prices will be based on the average NYMEX L3D settlement average and the 
following heat rate table:
  Load Level  Heat Rate  4.00 Gas Example Cap
  <25 GW   10,775   $43.10
  25 GW to 30 GW 14,175   $56.70
  30GW to 35 GW  17,225   $68.90
  35GW to 40 GW  27,225   $108.90
  >40 GW   $250/MWh  $250/MWh
Caps will be rounded up to the nearest $5/MWh increment.
Demand bids and demand responsiveness programs are exempt from these caps.
The ISO will post the price caps for each load level at least 48 hours prior 
to the beginning of each calendar month.  Based on the ISO's two day-ahead 
system load forecast, the ISO will post hourly caps at least 24 hours prior 
to the hour of delivery.

FERC Context
FERC has delegated cap authority to the CAISO until 11/15/2000.
The ISO has asserted that they don't need FERC authority since it is a bid 
cap rather than a sales cap.  FERC regulates sales, not purchases, of 
electricity and therefore can regulate sales prices but not purchase prices.
The ISO has filed with FERC for an extension of the price cap authority.  
FERC has to rule on the filing by 11/18/2000.  (Note that this is 3 days 
after their authority expires)
FERC will release its proposed order on 11/1/2000 based on the results of its 
206 investigation of the California wholesale power markets.  We don't know 
what they will find or what they will propose.
The proposed order will have a 30 day comment period, after which FERC will 
likely issue a final order.  FERC will be accepting oral comments on 
11/9/2000 in Washington.  Enron still has to determine who will provide oral 
comments.
Many companies have filed at FERC advocating or opposing a litany of price 
caps, cost based rates, and market redesign recommendations.
It is likely that the price caps approved by the ISO board will go into 
effect.  How long they will remain in effect will depend on whether FERC 
extends the ISO price cap authority and whether the final order stemming from 
the current 206 investigation stipulates a specific price cap policy.

Impact of Price Caps
The attached spreadsheet contains a table of likely maximum monthly prices at 
different gas price levels.  We think that this is the highest that markets 
would clear since it assumes that each hour clears at the cap.  It is hard to 
say whether actual prices would clear significantly lower than the cap 
because we don't know whether sellers will offer below the cap or at the 
cap.  The assumptions behind our analysis are detailed in the bullets below.
Take actual historical loads from 1999 and 2000.   
Calculate implied price cap for each hour using actual historical load, new 
price cap methodology, and a range of gas prices.
Divide historical hours into peak and off-peak buckets.
Calculate average price for each month for peak hours and off-peak hours.  
For example, we have two years worth of data for the months of January 
through September.  Each month has approximately 400 hours.  for January 
through September, we took approximately 800 observations for each month (400 
from each year) and calculated a simple average of all of the individual 
observations.
We created a peak table and an off-peak table.  The table shows the 
calculated implied cap based off of the acutal loads at varying gas prices 
for each month.  This value represents what the month would clear at if each 
hour cleared at the cap (based on historic loads).  While any given hour 
could be above this value, our calculation estimates the likely monthly 
average cap value!
The blue shading indicates what the caps would be given current (10/27/2000 
NYMEX) forward prices.  The yellow shading indicates those forward power 
prices which are in excess of the proposed cap.

Why Exercise???

1) My grandmother started walking five miles a day
 when she was 60.
 She's 97 now & we don't know where the hell she
 is.

 2) The only reason I would take up jogging is so
 that I could hear
 heavy breathing again.

 3) I joined a health club last year, spent about 400
 bucks. Haven't
 lost a pound. Apparently you have to show up.

 4) I have to exercise in the morning before my brain
 figures out what
 I'm doing.

 5) I don't exercise at all. If God meant us to touch
 our toes, he
 would have put them further up our body.

 6) I like long walks, especially when they are taken
 by people who
 annoy me.

 7) I have flabby thighs, but fortunately my stomach
 covers them.

 8) The advantage of exercising every day is that you
 die healthier.

 9) If you are going to try cross-country skiing,
 start with a small
 country.

 10) I don't jog. It makes the ice jump right out of
 my glass.

whether we were returning customers to the LDCs.  
I described our activities generally, and explained that the originial

been cleared up.  
Both seemed satisfied, appreciated the call and the information and will get 
back to me regarding whether we'll need to submit a formal response to

formally, but would be happy to do so.)
I asked them to contact me directly should they receive any other inquiries

Second, what do you think about sending the letter directly to Angelides--after all, he's the one who's being a chowder head--and cc'ing Loretta?

Subject:  Igaras Prepay - Next Steps

The structure for the financial prepay doesn't seem  to work under the 
Brazilian regulation therefore we need to come up with a different structure. 
David has put together a couple of different structures but basically all of 
them will run into the same problem and the Central Bank won't accept those.

We (Gustavo and I) had lunch last Thursday with a Mr. Jose Lavia owner of 
Fair Corretora (a brokerage house that I've worked with) basically he thinks 
that the financial prepay structure is not going to work because the Central 
Bank wants to see benefits for the country and impacts in the country's 
current balance.
He asked us to send him a draft of the structure and he will discuss with his 
partners to see if they came up with different ideas.

Below are the comments of the next steps and ideas from Antonio Felix 
(Tozzini Freire).


Central Bank:
As recommended by Antonio Felix from Tozzini Freire, we need to decide if 
this is a deal/structure we want to continue to pursue. If so we should 
schedule a meeting with the International Operations Director of the Central 
Bank in Brasilia and make a presentation covering the following points:

- The overall structure
- Market need
- Benefits to the companies involved (petrochemical, pulp and paper) - 
Benefits to Brazil ? (if any)

We should approach this not as a single transaction but as a new product, 
with specific characteristics, without any similar in the market, that Enron 
developed in the US and is trying to ""sell"" in Brazil.


Swaps:
A swap in Brazil can be arranged between two local parties and neither one 
needs to be a financial institution. If we want we can have a brokerage house 
or bank in the middle to register the contract with the BM&F (Mercantile 
Exchange).
The other possibility is to have a swap contract between a local and an 
offshore entity, in this case the offshore entity needs to be a financial 
institution.
Is one of the Enron companies in the US considered to be a financial 
institution ?

A specialist form Tozzini should be sending us some paper covering swap 
contracts. I hope to have a better understanding of the requirements for swap 
contracts after we receive that.

Yao Apasu: Andrea mentioned that you were involved with some swap contracts 
in Brazil. If you have anything about that (presentation, regulation) would 
you please forward  to us.



I think that we can structure the prepay mergin a simple loan and 
fix/floating swap, if the swap is something we are allowed to do under the 
Brazilian regulation.

Please add comments,

Andre

Michael

I have got CSFB working on the amendment you asked for.

In the meantime we have produced a graph which shows, as indices, market 
values of the water companies and the RAB of the industry since 
privatisation.  The following points come out
1 Market values overtime have been 1.1x RAB
2 The result is significantly skewed by the period between Mid 1997 and end 
1998 when the ratio was c1.5x.
3 The premium to RAB is only found at a time when political uncertainty has 
been removed the companies are able to outperform the regulatory deal 
significantly.  Those days are gone - a fact witnessed by the decline in 
share prices in the last year

Just to note that the graph we have produced here is a weighted average of 
water companies - whereas the figures we did yesterday on the RAB market 
value ratio is a straight average.  Obviously that influences the numbers a 
little.

On CustomerCo.  CSFB have contacted around 7 energy companies.  The result 
has been positive and they are prepared to enter our journal exercise.  I 
await a revised fee proposal but CSFB have been advised that it should be 
more modest than the last one !

With respect to this new counterparty for EnronOnline (correct name to

Sam Schott advises us that we are limited to 90 characters for a counterparty 
name in GCP.  The correct legal name for this counterparty is longer than 90 
characters.  I discussed this with Marcus Nettelton, our power lawyer, and if 
the following scenario meets with the approval of the financial and physical 
power Confirmation Desks we think the best way to treat this matter is to set 
the counterparty up in GCP as follows and then add this counterparty to the 
special handling list so all confirmations, physical and financial, offline 
and online, go out with the LEGAL NAME, not with the GCP NAME.

LEGAL NAME OF COUNTERPARTY:  Alliant Energy Corporate Services, Inc., as 
authorized agent for and on behalf of IES Utilities Inc., Interstate Power 
Company, and Wisconsin Power and Light Company

SUGGESTED NAME FOR GCP:   Alliant Energy Corporate Services, Inc., as Agent 
for three listed utilities

Joe and Kim, is this workable for the Confirm Desks?  If you can let me and 
Sam know then Sam can get them set us.

These could take a few days (or more!).  They have to be circulated to the 
directors of the Company for signature and timing will depend on their 
availability for signature.  If Amita wants to start signing today, she can 
go ahead and start signing now and I'll make her appointment effective as of 
today.

Hi Tana

Thanks for quick response.

I'm happy for the unanimous consents of the directors and the 
attorneys-in-fact.  Please could you let me know when these have been signed 
and are effective.

Thanks for your help.

Dear Mark and Vince
 
I know that it has been very trying for us all, but  I do believe that we have got there in the end! I have attached a copy of the  programme that I will send to the printers. Unless I hear from you  by tomorrow my time, I will ask the printer to proceed with the information  that I have.
 
We can discuss the exact specifics and logistics in  the near future. I will of course be in touch again and will send you both  copies of the brochure when it is printed. 
 
In the meantime, can I please have the following  information over the next few days (I know my demands are endless, but at least  they are no longer pressing!):
 
- a professional CV, around 70 to 100 words should  be fine
- your address
 
I thank you in advance for your co-operation and  look forward to working with you both on GARP 2002.
 
Kind regards
 
Andreas

the Lays is welcomed.  I hope that this would mean that you would remain
involved at some level.  The design of the model and its potential
economics could be key to how worthy the effort might be.   Enron could
be an ideal environment from which to the concept enhancement through to
commercialization could be successfully accomplished.  Please

"Thanks for your front-end research on this.  It's too bad that the training 
provider can't be as responsive!  In a trading organization, 2 to 3 months is 
an eternity.  Sounds as if they are inflexible as well.  Our audience for 
this training would be risk book adminstrators and traders, so 2 days away 
from the desk is not very workable either.  

After I get over my irritation at timing and inflexibility, I may want to 
book them for September, although with a much smaller audience than would be 
desireable if they insist on sticking to their 2 day method of delivery.    
Could I get an outline of their 2 day course to review in order to make this 
decision?  Thanks.  --Sally

Sally,
Angela Sprock forwarded your VM to me regarding the VAR training that you 
were looking to set up for your group.

I've taken the liberty of getting in touch with the suppliers to talk to them 
about the request and their availability. As well as discussing putting on 
the 2 day course solely for you group, I also discussed with them the 
possibility of breaking it up and delivering it in shorter  modules. Although 
they considered this, they are insistent that the course structure, the 
activities and the content lend themselves better to the 2 day format. 
They are a very busy company, in much demand both within Enron and other 
companies. Their earliest available dates are: September 14-15, and September 
21-22.

Alternatively, they have more flexibility on dates later in the year (October 
onwards - but that may be less of a fit).

How does this fit with your group?
Let me know if you want to discuss this further

delivery is perfect.

Also, if you will send the fuel cell document to swanita_99, I will make sure 
I download it and review before seeing Jerry tomorrow night.

Thanks!  Call me on my cell if you need anything.

"I talked to John Fielder (SVP Edison) about setting up a meeting for Barry Tycholiz with Edison's CFO about hedging Edison's QF price risk. Fielder wanted to talk about the negative CTC issue. Here's what he said:

They plan to ""settle"" with the ESPs and pay them when they pay everyone else, which he re-iterated would be sometime in Q1'02.
Edison is holding firm to the notion that the negative CTC contributed to the utility's undercollection and that the ESP's share of the undercollection has to be netted against the payables attributable to the negative CTC and owed the ESP.
He said that they will propose to net it out in one of two ways:  1) lump sum netting (i.e., if they owe $50MM and the share of the undercollection is $30 MM, then they pay the ESP $20 MM; or 2) future reductions in PX Credit (i.e., they pay the ESP $50 MM, and then reduce the PX going forward until the $30 MM is paid down).  The numbers are illustrative only.
In addition, he said that they have the view that a decision is going to have to be made about 1) whether DA customers pay for stranded costs tied to the DWR L-T contracts, and 2) whether DA customers pay going forward for stranded costs tied to the QF contracts.  (Edison is clearly lobbying the PUC to get DA customers to pay for these costs.)
I recommended strongly that he de-link issues 1 and 2 above from the issue of paying us ASAP what they owe us for negative CTC.  He agreed.
He said that the PUC judge's recently issued pre-hearing conference order requires that Edison ""meet and confer"" with ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th hearing, and that Edison intends to set something up with ESPs prior to that hearing.
Fielder is also the point person on ""getting ESPs paid"" and intends to initiate settlement discussions with ESPs week after next.
It was very clear from the conversation that Edison is going to do everything possible (at the expense of creditors) to maximize headroom under the settlement it struck with the PUC a few weeks ago.  Edison's stalemate with the QFs is evidence of it.  We shouldn't assume anything different with the Negative CTC issue.

If you have any questions, let us know.

Best,
Jeff"

Daren,

I'm attempting to clean up my allocations, due to this being allocation close 
week for Volume Management.

98-1534 (delivery meter) overflowed into March, day 1 only,  for .30 
decatherms (Sitara Deal #163005 - Start date 2/1/2000  and stop daate 
2/29/2000).  The 215K is the only one at this meter for Feb. 2000 
production.  I don't see a new Sitara deal number being referenced nor do I 
see the evergreen flag applied here.  Please apprise if you can extend the 
ticket for this small amount for 3/1/2000 or if you want it handled 
differently.  

98-1052 (delivery meter), allocated flow for 2/21-2/24/2000 with no K 
applied.    Days 22 and 23 for February references the 215K (Sitara Deal 
#168884 start date 2/22/2000 stop date 2/23/2000.  Sitara deal #201636 has 
the same start and stop date as 168884 and neither references an evergreen 
flag or a new deal number).  

Thanks

Dear Vince,

I hope your trip to Australia was successful. It's one of my favorite places
to go.

I've copied you on the email to Mike initiating Enron's trial service to
Energycast. Thanks for helping to set this up.

Would you ask the authorities in Enron to refresh my access to Enrononline?
My Guest User ID as ENA61296 and my guest password was TR84BY13. They no
longer work, probably because I haven't visited the site in months as we
were in full development mode on Energycast.

Vince, you will note in our website references to forward prices of power in
Nepool, NYPP, and PJM. We use Reuters as a reference -- not satisfactory. If
your traders like Energycast and Enron became a client, would Enron consider
linking its prices to our site? We have to improve over the Reuters quotes
and regard Enrononline or Bloomberg as the best candidates. Over time, as
our service spreads I believe this could help generate deal flow for your
traders.

Let me know what you think.

Ed

Subject: IMPORTANT ! : Motion of San Diego Gas & Electric Company (U 902-E)=
 for Adoption of an Electric Procurement Cost Recovery Mechanism and for Or=
der Shortening Time


Yesterday, SDG&E filed a motion for adoption of an electric procurement cos=
t recovery mechanism and for an order shortening time for parties to file c=
omments on the mechanism.  The attached email from SDG&E contains the motio=
n, an executive summary, and a detailed summary of  their proposals and rec=
ommendations governing procurement of the net short energy requirements for=
 SDG&E's customers.  The utility requests a 15-day comment period, which me=
ans comments would have to be filed by September 10 (September 8 is a Satur=
day).  Reply comments would be filed 10 days later.

The filing provides the following discussion of direct access:


  _____ =20

""Developing the net short requirements of consumers depends on the extent t=
o which they might be served instead by third party providers. The level of=
 direct access will affect these net short requirements. At present, there =
is substantial uncertainty concerning the future disposition of direct acce=
ss and third party supply of retail customers that jeopardizes creation of =
an optimal plan. This uncertainty has the potential for increasing costs to=
 San Diego retail customers as a result of unnecessary over- or under commi=
tments. To resolve this uncertainty, the Commission needs to coordinate dir=
ect access with resource planning, at least on an interim basis. SDG&E disc=
usses below how to provide for this coordination.=20

As the retail market matures, SDG&E expects that direct access elections wi=
ll gain stability and will not be characterized by severe volatility. That =
stability will allow planners to make reasoned assumptions on direct access=
 and rely on them in developing a procurement plan. However, today, direct =
access is subject to substantial uncertainty. Before the high prices of the=
 summer of 2000, approximately 20% of SDG&E's retail load had elected direc=
t access. By the beginning of 2001, direct access had reduced by nearly hal=
f. More recently, SDG&E has seen an increase in direct access, perhaps as a=
 result of two factors: first, would direct access customers be able to avo=
id paying a share of CDWR contract costs, and second, would the state suspe=
nd direct access, as appears to be permitted under ABx-1 1. Furthermore, th=
e legislature is considering legislation that would permit direct access, a=
nd other bills that would encourage municipal aggregation of load. The effe=
ct of this latter bill is similar to direct access, but it could cause larg=
e quantities of load to leave or return to the system quite abruptly.=20

These events illustrate the need for added coordination between direct acce=
ss and resource planning. The necessary coordination could come by using an=
 open enrollment period each planning cycle under which direct access elect=
ions take place. During that enrollment period, the utility is provided inf=
ormation on the amount of load electing direct access (or municipal aggrega=
tion) and the length of the direct access commitment. This open enrollment =
period would last for 90 days and commence 180 days before SDG&E is schedul=
ed to submit its procurement plan. Customers over 20kW would make commitmen=
ts to service by suppliers other than SDG&E of at least 5 years. Smaller cu=
stomers would make minimum one year commitments. These commitments and the =
use of a specific enrollment period would provide SDG&E with the informatio=
n it needs to plan to meet net short requirements and minimize the risk of =
over- or under-commitment.=20

In order to ensure an orderly process that protects consumers, change of se=
rvice would not occur until the commission ruled on the procurement plan, a=
nd, to the extent that the commission determined that excessive direct acce=
ss placed an unreasonable burden on utility customers, it could choose to l=
imit direct access. Those electing to leave utility procurement would pay a=
n exit fee to cover the costs of commitments made by CDWR and utility retai=
ned generation committed to those customers in order to protect remaining c=
ustomers. As a result of this change, SDG&E would not plan to provide commo=
dity service to departing customers. Customers returning from direct access=
 prematurely would be subject to a re-entry fee and to spot energy pricing,=
 again to protect those customers who did not elect to switch.
=20
Coordinating direct access with the planning process, at least for a near-t=
erm period, is important to ensuring a reasonable procurement plan.""

  _____ =20


The filing also briefly discusses competitive default supplier role:

  _____ =20

""When the State embarked on industry restructuring, one purpose was to take=
 advantage of the benefits that competitive markets can provide. Although C=
alifornia's experience with markets has not been as anticipated, it is stil=
l possible that a disciplined application of the market with adequate regul=
atory oversight can offer advantages to consumers. In fact, some states hav=
e undertaken to use the competitive market to meet customers' net short req=
uirements. For example, in parts of Pennsylvania, the State decided to auct=
ion off a piece of the procurement obligation to the competitive market. Ca=
lifornia may decide that it wants to do the same type of thing. If a portio=
n of the net short is auctioned off in this manner, from a planning standpo=
int, it should be treated the same as direct access: SDG&E will need adequa=
te notice and information to facilitate its planning for any net short posi=
tion remaining to be served, and the same use of exit fees and re-entry fee=
s should also apply.""

  _____ =20


There are a number of issues here which I think WPTF may want to comment up=
on, as we have dealt with many of these issues in previous filings.  Please=
 let me (and others) know if you agree.

Subject: DRAM Interim Policy Draft Approval

Michael and Steve -

Thanks for coming to the Risk Forum luncheon today, we enjoyed hearing about 
the new business opportunity.

Attached is a first draft of the approval form we'll want to circulate to the 
various functional signers for approval prior to sending to Rick Buy and 
Skilling for approval and granting of the limits - after we've completed.  I 
cut and pasted from information you provided, and have highlighted the areas 
that are missing information.  Please review and coordinate with the various 
functions and get back to David Port or to me with the missing information or 
any comments you have.

As for the Risk Assessment, we might want to take a look at that - I just cut 
and pasted the SWOT analysis in from the business plan so far.  I'll talk to 
David.  If any of the functional areas have specific issues we should 
document that will need to be addressed later at some point, let's make a 
note of them in this interim policy document so we don't lose track of them.

I'm also enclosing the Authorized Trader List  and Authorized Products List 
that will need to be completed once we figure out who will be designated the 
official head trader for this commodity group (will that be you?  Wade 
Dosier?), and the presentation prepared by you for those who did not receive.




As far as Market Risk Management, we work as a team here, so feel free to 
contact either David at x39823 or me at x30429 - I handle the risk policy and 
procedures side, whereas David  is taking the lead on this new initiative 
from a market risk perspective and will be addressing specific business and 
technical issues.  Christian LeBroc at x58062 will also be working for David 
reviewing the quantitative risk parameters.  

Regards,
Cassandra.

Dear Poolsters,

I just want you all to know that I, Cameron's boyfriend, the guy who is 
behind Cameron's picks (save when we came in #1 last week, when I was out of 
town, and Cameron did the picks -- an accomplishment slightly embarrassing, 
but wonderful all the same) and the same guy who moved to San Francisco for 
Cameron (or for our relationship), and, upon my arrival, pledged my loyalty 
-- in front of the whole Sellers' family, hand on Bible -- to the 49ers (it 
was easier when Steve Young retired, for Cameron told me that he was the 
only man she would ever leave me for... Gosh I love Jeff Garcia!)... Yes 
this same guy was begging for Cameron to take the 49ers against Dallas. 
Begging. Entrapped by the hubris of winning last week, she refused my 
advise. So, we ended up in 3rd. Oh well. Things could be worse. I just 
wonder, maybe this is the sign of a true fan, someone who refuses to pick 
the 49ers for fear that the heart's involved... Nah, I'll still pick 'em, 
even if I have to beg. Good luck to all, and go 49ers!

Carol,

I need to fill you in on the new structure. Essentially the senior debt will 
now be Corp guaranteed and on balance sheet. The swap adjustments will 
therefore impact equity only.

We are now projecting financial close as the week of June 19th - the week I 
go on holiday!. That means preliminary offering memo for the guaranteed notes 
going out around the last week of May. By then, everything has to be 
finalised (including the swap).

Hope this helps your planning. 

All is well and will be better when Margaux closes. 

All the best with being a mum again!

"To give you more clarity, Stephen transferred to EBS effective July 1, 2000.  
His move to EBS was agreed to earlier in 2000, with the understanding that it 
would be effective upon the completion of the SAP implementation for ENA on 
July 1.  Stephen was playing a critical role in ENA to insure a smooth 
transition for SAP, and Todd Lindholm at EBS was in agreement that Stephen 
would remain an ENA employee through implementation, with his performance 
review being based on his work for ENA.  Stephen is very talented and will no 
doubt do a great job at EBS.  During the first 6 months of 2000, however, his 
heart was already at EBS and he failed to communicate with my other direct 
reports on SAP issues, consistently missed my staff meetings, recruited our 
other key SAP expert to EBS without a back-up plan for ENA, etc.  It was his 
failure to make his SAP assignment a priority that landed him in the Needs 
Improvement category relative to other directors on my team.   It is the r
elativity of his performance that is key, not necessarily the label of that 
category.

Date: 4/20/01
To: Jan Smutny-Jones, Steven Kelly, Katie Kaplan
Cc: IEP Board of Directors
From: Julee Malinowski-Ball, Edson + Modisette
RE: Legislative Status Report Week Ending 4/20


RECENT EVENTS:

-- IEP with the help of Chris Ellison has been at the negotiating table mos=
t
of the week dealing with the most recent amendments to SB 28x.  SB 28x
(Sher/Battin) makes various changes to the siting process including many
IEP-sponsored proposals.  As you will recall, two new provisions were added
to the bill at the last minute before going to the Assembly Floor dealing
with both retrofit schedules and environmental dispatch of generating
facilities.  Per the direction from IEP member companies, IEP has decided
not to negotiate on the environmental dispatch issue. If the provision
remained in the bill, IEP would continue to push the Republicans to hold
their opposed position. We were, however, given the authority to negotiate
on the retrofit issue as long as we were only talking about facilities that
already have retrofit requirements.  I will be faxing out the agreed upon
language which in essence says the ARB shall set a schedule for the
completion of any mandated retrofits.  It does not expand the authority of
the air districts and ARB to mandate retrofits under existing law. The
schedule would require completion of the retrofits by July 1, 2004 or such
later date as the ISO determines is necessary to maintain reliability.

With these amendments, including some clean-up language, SB 28x will be
voted-on on the Assembly floor on Monday and go to the Senate for
concurrence on Tuesday.  The final version will include the following
IEP-sponsored proposals:

? Conforming the timing of offsets for power plants to Clean Air Act
requirements
? Substituting CEQA-style hearings for the trial-like proceedings of the CE=
C
? Streamlining the permit process for the modernization of existing power
plant sites
? Giving consideration to the positive environmental impacts of a proposed
project.
? Improving the timeliness and coordination of state and local agency
review.
? Extending the current deadlines for the expedited review process
established in AB 970.

Since SB 28x is only a first step in making changes to the siting process,
IEP member should now be thinking about what is next.  IEP proposals still
on the table include:

? Permitting local agencies to make zoning changes or other decisions for
power plants contingent upon CEC CEQA Compliance
? Giving deference to other state and regional agencies
? Easing the threshold for override of local land use requirements.
? Making the ISO responsible for determining interconnection requirements

-- Bad news on the =01&California First=018 issue quickly followed the good=
 news.
The CEC staff analysis which said the State can't require builders of new
power plants to sell electricity here, even as a trade-off for expedited
permitting, was countered by another staff analysis that says the state can=
.
Both documents cannot be obtained due to attorney-client privilege.  This
issue is coming to a head next week with a decision pending by the CEC to
include a California First clause on the approval of an expedited AES power
plant project.

AB 60x (Hertzberg), which ties to the siting process the requirement that a
developer enter into a contract to sell power to specified California
entities, is still poised to be heard in the Senate Energy committee.  IEP
members company lobbyist should continue to lobby against this measure
regardless of the CEC=01,s decision on AES, although our arguments are
definitely strengthened if the addition of the clause at the CEC is denied.

-- IEP has finalized negotiations with Senator Burton=01,s office on amendm=
ents
attempting to solve our problem with the eminent domain provision in SB 6x
(Burton), which is the State Power Authority measure.  Attached is a copy o=
f
the bill in PDF form.  The agreed upon language, which clarifies that the
Authority=01,s purpose is to supplement existing generation activities, can=
 be

Subject: Re: Enron Trading  

I had a chance to review your presentation.  Bill and I have been working 
with Sally Beck, Global Energy Ops and she will identify a  resource to help 
insure all internal controls (specific to  trading activities) are in place 
in India.   As I understand the plan for coal, India will function mostly as 
an origination unit  with the London office being responsible for supplying 
the coal.  Therefore, the net Enron position will probably be carried in the 
London books.   However, risk books will still be required in India to 
determine the net  MTM  for the 3rd party sales commitments in India.  These 
books should include both the intercompany purchase from London  and the 3rd 
party sales.  The commercial group in India  will be responsible for local 
curves  (location (basis) specific - usually transportation costs), and 
energy operations (this will probably be you  initially until the trading 
activity has grown) will be responsible for the deal capture process 
(including contract administration), a settlement process and risk management 
administration (daily valuation and reporting of risk books).   Accounting 
will be responsible for the reconciliation of risk books to the general 
ledger and financials.    There will also be a logistics process.   The 
following questions need to be addressed:  

  With the increased  coal volumes will an increase in trading limits be 
required?
      My understanding that the London coal group will be responsible for 
determining this and working with Ted Murphy to change the 
      policy, if necessary.   
  What trading activities will be performed in India vs. London?
      The answer to this is needed to determine the control infrastructure 
required for the India office.    

Sally's employee starts on Monday,   I will let you know who she is and 
arrange a call.    You can rest assured, that although this may seen 
complicated (and it is), Sally's Energy Ops team will be able to hold your 
hand all the way through this process.    It will be critical that we 
demonstrate the control infrastructure is in place, before we can obtain 
sigh-off for trading from Rick Buy. 

Looking forward to helping you get this ready for a July 1 start date. 


Thanks,
Wanda Curry

It was nice talking to you on the conference call. Have you had a chance to 
review my presentation?. Your comments would be extremely helpful to me. When 
we setup the Risk/Credit/Accnt/MIS/Internal Control function, I want to make 
sure we do it RIGHT the FIRST time, keeping in mind that there is always room 
for improvement later.

In addition, I would like to discuss with you certain thought I have on the 
accounting, budgeting,internal controls and internal audit areas in EIPL. Do 
you plan to travel to India in the near future. Please let me know.

Thanks and Regards.

"Sorry to have to respond via e-mail but I've got laryngitis (although I 
should be in most of the day today).

The actual opening of the agreement is simple because we have a good broker 
relationship and the agreement is acceptable to us.  BUT, the broker WILL NOT 
open the agreement until we can submit the underlying authority which 
includes:

authorizing resolutions (or unanimous consent) from the account party
trading authorization
number of signatures for transacting

Marie previously sent ""samples"" of the the underlying documentation to Robert

We have not received anything to date.

When we receive the information, we can fax EVERYTHING to the broker and the 
account can be opened immediately and then followed up by original hard

"I'm surprised that under the circumstances American won't just do it.  Linda and I both had to reschedule our flights and did it directly with the airline (Continental for me and Virgin for Linda).  Of course, in our cases the original flights were cancelled.  I don't have the Cunard reservations number here and haven't been able to access the web site this afternoon.  I will get it for you when I get home.  The fax number for the guest relations department is (305)463-3030.

In a sense I felt safer in London than here.  Once we got off the QE2 we weren't doing anything that would have made us attractive targets and I don't anticipate attacks against individual Americans overseas -- at least not outside of Muslim countries.  While there was an increase in police presence around town, we didn't hear of any actual threats to Americans while we were in London.  Airport security has been better there than here for a long time and now has been beefed up even further.  The Europeans just have more recent experience at dealing with terrorists than we do.  The sword rattling doesn't bother me too much.  I've been overseas during some tense international times before and as long as you're in a friendly country it shouldn't be an issue.  On the other hand, it REALLY feels good to be home and I can sure understand your wanting to have her with you.

From her point of view, I think that while the Brits were all being very sympathetic and supportive, the tragedy just isn't as immediate there and so the impact on Amanda has been somewhat less than if we had been home.  Given that, I think she doesn't want to waste this opportunity to do something fun in Europe while she has the chance and is already over there.  For me I have to say it was hard to have any fun after Tuesday noon, although I tried to put a good face on it.  I don't know when that will improve since I'm still pretty depressed.  It's probably even worse for you since you were so much closer to things than I am.  The lawyer in me sees two sides: (a) a trip to Paris is just the thing to take your mind off of events and (b) why waste a week of vacation and travel hassles when you aren't going to have a good time no matter where you go.

Feel free to give me a call if you want to chat.

Good luck!

Hi Elyse:
I work in government affairs in San Francisco.

The legislator is someone who has been and will likely continue to be supportive of Dave's on-going commercial activities and Dave would like to participate.  I've been informed that this could fall under the sorts of activities that community affairs has resources for.  Is that right?  Thanks for the help.

Subject: Unresolved Issues for Jan 1.- Followup

Here is a followup to the memo sent on 12/31/99.  FYI


Enron Field Services   -  Has not been nominated since September 99.  Have we 
stopped doing business on this pipe?  (Just an FYI - ?)  Do we need to get 
this assigned?  I can find old
   notes and try to get this pathed if necessary.  Someone just needs to let 
me know. Unresolved - appears to be unassigned?  We no longer do business on 
Enron Field Services.

Lavaca Expense Transport -  This is offsystem gas that HPLC Transports for 
ENA.  ENA has no nom at meter 1000 in Pops for Jan 1. Unresolved  We should 
have a sale to Entex.   The deal will be enrtered in Sitara.

MidCon Texas Pipeline   -  There were deals left unpathed for Jan 1 (and 
Dec?).  I brokered and nominated the obvious but we seem to have 10,000 with 
transport contract to move this    gas on and no sale to broker to.  As it 
stands, it looks like we have a long position.  Who is this assigned to?  I 
thought Carlos was handling this one, but I could    be wrong.  Unresolved  
We have a sale on ECT to Entex in Sitara.

Channel Industries Pipeline  -  Several issues here:

 1. All Deals with the exception of the long term Transport Expense were left 
unpathed for Jan 1.  I viewed prior month transactions and pathed 
appropriately.  Someone
  needs to review for accuracy. Also, there were deals that went to zero, 
that were nominated for January.  Resolved but needs to be verified.

 2. We still do not have enough supply to meet our sales requirement.  This 
issue has been left unsresolved since October 99.  Volume Management cannot 
allocate was is
  not pathed and nominated.  Unresolved or Unpathed?  Carlos is looking into 
this.

 3. There is a transaction for January that is once again not on our point 
specific transport contracts.  (Rec Mtr 1-6366 10,000 to Del Mtr 2-6203 
10,000).  This is a pathed pipeline. We have no rate.  We need to know the 
rate and whether one of the expense contracts needs to be amended for this 
transaction, we are not legally covered.  Carlos was handling this pipe in 
Dec.  Who is this assigned to for Jan? Unresolved  Carlos nom'd this to 
Channel.  He knows the contract and rate (negotiated by Elsa).

HPL Operational -  This Shipper on HPL has been left unpathed for December 
and January 1.  Who is this assigned to?  This can wait until we get back 
next week.  If it is left     unresolved, I will get it pathed when I return. 
I haven't had time to do this yet.  If we haven't figured out the assignement 
then I will get to it asap.

   Occasion:  Farewell Party - Joni Veselack
  Day:  Sunday, September 10
  Time:  4:00 p.m.
  Place:  Woods on Augusta (pool area)

 I'm heading up north and didn't want to leave without having one
last get together around the pool!!! So, I decided to fire up the grill and
bbq.  I will have some snacks along with the bbq, but any side dishes or
desserts will definitely be enjoyed by one and all.

 Please bring your own ""Cheer"".

 Also, I need a head count for how much bbq to buy. (Get your minds
out of the gutter.) So, please let me know if you're attending.

I spoke with Gordon.  The assets that he knew about were ones that we have 
already looked at.  I was very nice and told him that I was appreciative of 
his notifying us about them.  

I owe him a call to tell him whether we are still pursuing these projects or 
whether we have given up on them.  Gordon wanted to be sure that we had no

Subject: Auction Procedures

Unless you object, we have decided to structure the auction site with the 
""auction procedures"" set out on the bid page, immediately above the ""submit"" 
button.  As soon as the bid is submitted, the system will check to see if the 
counterparty has already accepted the GTC's or has a master in place.  Here 
is S&C's first draft of the procedures for an auction without a reserve 
price, with no commitment to sell (or buy) and no disclosure of bids to other 
parties.  It is my impression that this is the way the EnBank auctions will 
be conducted.  Is that correct?  Any suggestions/comments?

Barry,

FYI the California QF's are negotiating a settlement deal with Edison and the state of California which would fix energy payments over five years.  Currently the energy payments are indexed to Socal Border because a majority of the Edison QF's buy spot gas.  If this settlement happens, the QF's will likely want to buy financial swaps.  The Edison gas-fired QF's represent about 500MMCF/Day of gas.

Subject:	UBS FX payment


Sara-thank you for looking into this issue for us.  Here is a brief
summary of what occured.


UBS and Enron entered into a Sterling-UBS spot transaction on 11-19-01,
which both parties confirmed and settled on 11-21. (UBS pays USD
7,083,500 and receives 5 mio sterling).

On 11-21 UBS and Enron erroneously confirmed the same trade again for
settlement on 11-21. UBS made a second USD 7,083,500 payment to Enron's
account at BA-Dallas on 11-21 (payment reference: FED IMA
1121B1Q8052C001081).

UBS did not receive the Sterling it was expecting and for the next few
days Enron and UBS tried to resolve the non-payment based on a mistaken
assumption that Enron owed 5 mio Sterling to UBS.

On 11-28, UBS realized that the trade was duped and on 11-29 informed
Enron of the nature of the error and requested that the USD payment be
returned. Enron agreed to return the USD payment on 11-29. The returned
payment was never received.

If you need additional information please contact me at 203-719-1141 or
Bryan Murtagh 203-719-8955.  Here are our contacts at Enron who are
aware of this issue.

Subject: Update


Vince,

Sorry I haven't been pressing you on the paper but there's always more to
do than we have time for.  However, I had a phone call from the editor
encouraging me to get the paper to him by Christmas so it could serve as
the centerpiece of his energy issue.  His comment to me was ""everyone wants
to know what Enron's doing"".  So, with that said I'll try to put together a
list of materials that I have collected and maybe we can have a phone
conversation to get your ideas on a plan to put the paper together.  The
Harvard cases do a nice job of laying out institutional and historical
details but we will need a ""tack"" or theme to begin the writing process.

By the way, we have managed to delay the Spring Texas Finance Festival one
week so that it will not coincide with Easter (hope you can now attend).
We didn't have too many problems with the Easter weekend but there were
some and we would prefer not to use that weekend either.

Hope all is going well for you guys.  Tell Stinson hello for me.

Your friend,

John

"I know that there are a number of things that do not work as we had 
anticipated in SAP.  I also know that there are several things where we have 
to change our processes to accomodate differences or gaps in SAP.  We also 
have significant issues with the timing of certain runs within SAP and a 
mismatch of that timing with our business processes.  There was a concerted 
effort kicked off by the SAP team last week to try and identify and resolve 
issues.  They met with my direct reports.  However, we have to reconvene as 
we ran out of time to cover all issues!  I have asked Leslie Reeves and Bryce 
to get back to me on even more detail on this example so that we can fully

Russell - as I remember, Willie finaled the Supply Verification and it was 
interfaced to SAP.  This is fine, and then Willie was going to net the A/P 
and A/R.  SAP went down after the statement was interfaced, but before Willie 
was able to block or net the payment.  When SAP came back up the next day, 
the payment had already gone out and we were unable to recall the wire.  If 
you have any further questions about this, call me.  Thanks.

Willie,

Per our earlier conversation, can you or Audrey or Bryce, please give further 
explain to me as to why the funds were wired to Perry Gas for purchases from 
the counterparty instead on netting the amounts between purchases and sales.  
You mentioned to me the process of overriding the counterparty's that net on 
SAP, although because of timing, the override did not take place.

Thank you,

Russell

"Nick,

The airport is about 30 minutes  by cab from the office (1400 Smith).
The best hotel is either Hyatt Regency Downtown or Doubletree 
Downtown (it is important to emphasize Downtown when making
reservations). The hotels are within a walking distance
from  the Enron building.

We can make reservations  for dinner around 6:30 - 7:00
in a resturant  within 10 minutes by car from the hotel.

By the way, we shall be very glad to reimburse you for the trip related 
expenses.

Confidential; Attorney client work product; Not discoverable

Here is a rough draft.  I will also start on TVA letter.  Per my earlier vm, 
I am struggling with the benefit of a 2 year proposal vs. 7.  I'm not sure if 
we get any ""cap"" benefit from making a seven year deal even if TVA doesn't 
accept our offers (benefit would assume that TVA has an obligation to cover 
entire position which is contrary to what our outside counsel has said in the 
past.  According to Bob, since TVA is asking for specific performance, it may 
not be reasonable for TVA to cover entire period.  I will try to talk to him 
tonight.). If  TVA accepts one of our proposals and then we lose the 
termination argument, what do we do? Supply? Terminate Again? In either case 
our proposal for 7 years will likely not cap our damages.  Let me know what 
you think.  I'll be in early tomorrow.  Thanks"

Subject:	Global Standard on Valuation Methodology Changes and Model Approval

Sally / Beth,

As we discussed when I was in Houston I have put together a draft on Valuation Methodology Changes and Model Approval. I had a meeting arranged for today to go through my proposal with Ted Murphy and Tani Nath (she heads up research and structuring here in London) but Ted cancelled at the last minute (again). Tani and I met and are broadly in agreement, but before we can go any further we need Ted's input. He is now away for 2 1/2 weeks so there is going to be no further progress on this front.

In the mean time I would appreciate your comments on what I have put together. I would prefer it if it is not circulated around Houston at this stage until I can accurately say that Ted is happy from a global RAC perspective. Likewise I still need to get Houston research comfortable but I am going to wait until Ted has had a chance to add his feedback so I can at least say that it is only Houston research that is outstanding. Others will also need to be consulted (and I would like to agree a list of key people with you) but I can't see their being any real contention. Can you ?

I am assuming that resourcing is likely to be an issue for you in Houston (and it may well be here too) and this has been added to the outstanding list. I am envisaging that some of the risk management work could be completed as part of the curve validation 

If there are any questions or feedback please let me know.

James

Subject: Recycling Summary Integration plan

Please find attached the summary integration plan that you requested during 
our debriefing last week. 

The first part of the table shows the controls objectives and the controls in 
place at 31 Dec 2000 when Enron Metal Recycling was divided into two halves: 
MGMR and Bergman.  Our overall controls assessment per risk at that stage was 
level 2 (below average controls).  

We have sumarised the implementation steps required to achieve an increase in 
controls assessment to level 3 (average), 4 (good)  or 5 (excellent) in each 
case,  along with latest completion dates to achieve those controls. 

We have then added a column of comments on the actual implementation with a 
bar chart to show how far advanced the work is.  The revised controls 
assessment at 31 Jan shows an average of 2.5 and our plan should enable the 
controls to be around a level 3 (average) by end of February. 

We will issue a revised table monthly in order to clearly update you on our 
progress.  If you would like to schedule a specific meeting to go through any 
of the points or queries that you may have, please let me know and I will 
organise.

Many thanks

Naomi

With the on-going discussions in CA, we need to make sure that we understand 
what would happen if a core / non-core split were implemented.

Basically, what is the 1 year, 3 year, and 5 year price for a E-19 and E-20 
customer with a typical load profile?  Has to be all in (as if EES were 
selling gen only service).

Give me a call if this does not make sense.

Subject: EOL Project

Vince,

Just to update you on how things are going with regard to EOL -

I had a meeting with John Arnold yesterday to show him what had been 
accomplished to date, and I think that he was fairly impressed by the 
information available. I asked him for his input, and he expressed his 
interest in having a couple of reports made up that couldn't be created from 
the format the data was in. I spoke to Clayton about this, and he has already 
made changes that will reflect a number of the modifications John requested.

I am also continuing to research the issue of an automated trading platform 
for EOL. I have some information about how the NASDAQ operates, and I have 
looked at some websites for ECNs, such as Archipelago, Island and Instinet. I 
have also had a look at the International Securities Exchange (ISE) web-site, 
but they do not seem to explain much about their system. Any further 
suggestions would be appreciated.

I want to find out more about where EOL is currently and what modifications 
may be necessary in the existing system, finish reading the material at the 
websites I have investigated, and then I will try to put together a 
presentation for you and/or Greg Whalley.

Tom

"Amy:
Here are my answers  to your questions:
1.  Yes I think its a good idea, because you are able to reach a wide 
audience with this advertisement.  
2.  I don't think the contest should be limited to just these 
schools/conferences.  You probably should open it up to all schools to get an 
even wider reach of potential candidates.
3.  I would think that if you had a certain amount for the cash prize that 
people would take it seriously to try and win the cash.
4.  Please let me know if I can support you in any way.

"Karen -

We were very involved in the discussions of the report with FERC staff.  The 
response that Mary filed recently just formalized our earlier verbal comments 
- now it's on the record.  I am not sure, however, if everything we want will 
be in the report.  We will monitor very closely.

We will participate in the Nov 9 hearing (as much as it makes sense).  

I agree that we need to be ready for comment on Nov 1 and after to discuss 
any negative impacts.

How come FERC has finalized their report without our comments?!  We need to 
be prepared to respond when they issue their report -- we can line up 
broadcast interviews (CNBC, CNN) in response -- and also target specific 
publications.  We'll need to prepare ""sound bite"" messages based on our 
filing (I haven't seen it yet, but Mary Hain is supposed to be sending it).  
Keep me posted on the time and place of the Nov. 1 press conference.  Also, 
are we participating in the Nov. 9 public hearing?  Let me know. thx. kd

Article noting that FERC will have special meeting on Nov 1 re California

(Friday) about how the market will be fixed: 
FERC To Meet Nov 9 To Propose Remedies To Calif 
                    Pwr Mkt 
                    Friday, October 20, 2000 08:17 AM 
  
                    LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--In an unusual move, the Federal 
Energy Regulatory                     Commission said Thursday it will meet 
Nov. 1 to discuss remedies to California's                     troubled 
wholesale power market. 
                    Details of a probe into California's wholesale 
electricity market will also be released at                     the Nov. 1 
meeting. As reported, state and federal regulators launched the probe over    
                 the summer, saying the market wasn't workably competitive. 
                    FERC also said it expects to hold a public hearing Nov. 9 
to discuss possible                     solutions to California's power 
crisis. 
                    The place and time of both meetings haven't been decided 
yet. 
                    Regarding Thursday's announcement, FERC Commissioner Curt 
Hebert said ""rather                     than waiting for Nov. 1 to release 
the findings of our staff's investigation, I urge the                     
chairman to release the completed report now...it can only help heal the raw 
emotions                     rampant in the state of California."" 
                    FERC said it was rare that it would announce details of 
its procedures. The                     commission said its own rules don't 
allow it to normally announce its procedures. 
                    ""Because of the need for expeditious action to address 
the serious issues affecting                     California electric power 
markets and California consumers...the commission is taking                   
  the unusual step of announcing in advance the procedures it expects to 
follow over the                     coming weeks to move forward in these 
proceedings,"" the FERC order said. 
                    The commission said it will give a three-week deadline 
for parties to intervene and to                     comment on the possible 
solutions presented by the commission. 
                    FERC said it anticipates issuing an order by the end of 
the year ""adopting and                     directing remedies to promptly 
address to the extent possible the identified problems                     
adversely affecting competitive power markets in California."" 
                    If necessary, FERC said it would hold additional meetings 
to develop solutions ""to                     other identified problems."" 
                    California's wholesale power prices soared this past 
summer. Customers of San                     Diego Gas & Electric Co., a unit 
of Sempra Energy Corp. (SRE, news, msgs), paid                     
market-based rates for power, which resulted in triple-digit utility bills 
for its customers.                     The state's three investor-owned 
utilities also racked up billions of dollars in debt due                     
to high wholesale costs. 
                    SDG&E customers are currently paying a fixed rate for 
their power, while customers of                     the state's other two 
utilities are still bound by a rate-freeze. 
                    Generators have been accused of gouging customers and 
manipulating the market,                     although no evidence has been 
offered up yet. However, the FERC investigation may                     
address that.

Cal-ISO CEO To Announce Remedy To Lower Power

                    Friday, October 20, 2000 08:16 AM 
                    (This article was originally published Thursday) 
                    LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--California Independent System 
Operator Chairman and                     Chief Executive Terry Winter will 
hold a news conference Friday morning to announce                     a 
possible solution to reduce the state's electricity costs. 
                    An ISO spokesman wouldn't comment on the details of the 
news conference. 
                    According to a news release, Winter will speak about 
""potential vehicles for containing                     costs, while 
maintaining the ISO's high standards of reliability."" 
                    The ISO controls about 75% of California's power grid and 
real-time market. As                     already reported, the grid operator 
has come under fire this summer for failing to                     
immediately reduce a price cap in its real-time market. 
                    Currently, state Sen. Steve Peace, D-Chula Vista, is 
drafting legislation to merge the                     ISO and the state's 
Power Exchange.

	Calif GOP Lawmakers Ask PUC President To Resign 
	
	
	Updated: Tuesday, March 20, 2001 02:14 PM?ET 
	
	? 
	?
	
	
	
	
	LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--California Assembly Republicans have called for the 
resignation of Loretta Lynch, president of the state's Public Utilities 
Commission, saying they have no confidence that the state's top regulator 
will ""play a constructive role in solving the state's energy crisis."" 
	Assembly Republican Minority Leader Bill Campbell, R-Villa Park, sent a 
letter Tuesday to Gov. Gray Davis on behalf of the Assembly's Republican 
Caucus asking Davis to call for Lynch's resignation. 
	
	
	?
	""With efforts to solve California's energy crisis floundering in the midst of 
unpaid bills, stalled negotiations and rolling blackouts, it has come time to 
ask for the resignation of your appointed president of the California Public 
Utilities Commission, Loretta Lynch,"" the letter said. 
	Both Lynch and a spokesman for Davis were unavailable for comment. 
	Lynch, a former attorney, was appointed president of the PUC by Davis in 
March 2000. She is the state's top regulator, in charge of regulating 
utilities, telecommunications, commercial transportation and water companies. 
Before her appointment to the PUC, Lynch was head of Davis's office of 
Planning and Research. 
	The letter says the PUC had a number of opportunities last summer to keep the 
electricity crisis from spiraling out of control by allowing Edison 
International (EIX, news, msgs) unit Southern California Edison, PG&E Corp. 
(PCG, news, msgs) unit Pacific Gas & Electric and Sempra Energy (SRE, news, 
msgs) unit San Diego Gas & Electric to sign long-term power supply contracts 
for about $50 a megawatt-hour, nearly $30 lower than the new long-term 
contracts Davis said the state entered into recently with generators. 
	Lynch's failure to ""ensure that the commission's Aug. 3, 2000, emergency 
order on long-term contracts was quickly implemented has placed the state 
budget at risk for costs now at least 40% higher,"" the letter said. ""This 
hesitancy in a crisis will cost California's economy tens of billions of 
dollars during the next 20 years."" 
	The state has spent more than $3 billion since January buying power in the 
spot market. Davis has asked lawmakers for another $500 million from the 
general fund to continue buying power. If the $500 million is granted, the 
state's commitment to power purchases will surpass $4 billion. 
	State Sen. Steve Peace, D-El Cajon, however, said last week that the Senate 
Budget Committee will deny further requests for funding unless the PUC carves 
out a revenue stream for the state's Department of Water Resources, the 
agency that is now buying the bulk of the state's power on behalf of the 
cash-strapped utilities. 
	The PUC was expected to release guidelines last week on rates the DWR can 
receive from utilities to pay back the general fund and to issue revenue 
bonds to pay for long-term contracts. But the guidelines haven't yet been 
released. 
	Last year, the PUC said the utilities could enter into limited long-term 
supply contracts to hedge their positions against price spikes. But the 
commission also said it feared if the utilities signed long-term deals with 
generators, liquidity in the wholesale market would be reduced. 
	The Republican lawmakers said the commission is responsible for nearly 
forcing the utilities into bankruptcy. 
	""We have no confidence that Loretta Lynch will play a constructive role in 
solving the energy crisis in the weeks and months ahead,"" the letter said. 
""With Wall Street nervous about repayment of the $10 billion in revenue bonds 
needed to cover the state's energy purchases, the CPUC has been unable to 
perform an adequate assessment of the investor-owned utilities' financial 
situation.""

 As a follow-up to the recent Enron Corp. memorandum forming Enron Wholesale 
Services (EWS), effective today, we have reorganized the Wholesale Services 
Legal Department.

 The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:  (i) align the 
legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed 
the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve 
greater efficiency and consistency across the organization.

 To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will 
include Lance Schuler, Enron Americas; Mark Evans, Enron Europe; Mark Taylor, 
Enron Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, Enron Global Markets; Julia Murray, Enron

Small electric producers OK big
 price cut



 By Ed Mendel 
 STAFF WRITER 

 February 23, 2001 


 SACRAMENTO -- Legislators said yesterday that small generators who
 produce about 30 percent of the state's power have agreed to cut their power
 prices in half, an important step toward easing the electricity crisis.

 Negotiations continued on what Gov. Gray Davis has called the final step: the
 state purchase of the transmission systems of the three investor-owned 
utilities
 in exchange for paying off their huge debt.

 Meanwhile, the amount that the state is spending to buy power for the
 customers of the utilities grows. Officials gave notice that an additional 
$500
 million will be needed in 10 days, bringing the total to $2.6 billion.

 But for the first time in nearly six weeks the state did not declare an alert
 yesterday due to power shortages. More power was available from other
 states, and some power plants that had been shut down for maintenance
 resumed operation.

 Two legislators, Sen. Jim Battin, R-Palm Desert, and Assemblyman Fred
 Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, said they introduced legislation that sharply
 reduces the prices paid to small generators after weeks of difficult
 negotiations.

 ""Ultimately, this bill will reduce the cost of energy to the state and its
 ratepayers by billions of dollars,"" said Battin, who represents eastern San
 Diego County.

 About half of the small generators use ""renewable"" technologies such as 
solar,
 wind, geothermal and biomass. The rest is ""co-generation,"" when fuel is used
 for industrial purposes and electricity is generated as a by-product.

 The small generators have grown to produce nearly a third of California's
 power under a two-decade-old federal ""qualifying facilities"" program, which
 requires utilities to buy their power.

 Battin and Keeley said that under the bill, SB 47X, the average price for 
these
 QF contracts could drop from the current 17 cents per kilowatt-hour to about
 8 to 8.5 cents per kilowatt-hour.

 ""We believe that the rates are at least that low, if not lower,"" said Jan
 Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers,
 which represents small and large generators.

 The small generators support the bill because it will give them a stable 
price
 for five years, avoiding ups and downs and the possibility that state 
regulators
 might make a more unfavorable price cut.

 Much of the current price formula is based on the price of natural gas at the
 California border, which has soared this winter. The legislation spreads the
 price bench mark over a five-year period.

 ""We encourage the Legislature to take quick action to approve SB 47X as
 quickly as possible to help stabilize the electricity crisis,"" Smutny-Jones 
said.

 He said one of the side agreements to the legislation is the creation of a
 portfolio of long-term contracts to purchase natural gas for some
 co-generators, lowering their production costs.

 The legislation was applauded as ""a major step forward"" by a group of small
 generators who formed a creditors committee last week and threatened to
 take the utilities into bankruptcy.

 ""We call on the Legislature and the governor to act on it immediately,"" said
 Chris Thompson, a spokesman for the group.

 Thompson said Southern California Edison continues to collect money from
 ratepayers, as the state buys power for its customers, but is not paying
 anything to the small non-polluting generators.

 A spokesman for a geothermal generator in El Centro, which filed a lawsuit
 seeking $45 million from Edison for power provided since November,
 welcomed the legislation for giving generators stability and ratepayers 
cheaper
 power.

 But Vince Signorotti, a spokesman for CalEnergy, said it would be
 ""premature"" to consider dropping the lawsuit.

 Battin and Keeley said that payment of the small generators depends on the
 governor's attempt to negotiate the purchase of the transmission systems of
 Edison, Pacific Gas and Electric, and San Diego Gas and Electric in exchange
 for payment of their debt.

 As part of the governor's plan, the utilities would agree to provide low-cost
 power for five to 10 years from their generators, which provide about a third
 of the state's power.

 Davis aides are attempting to negotiate long-term contracts with generators
 for the remaining third of the power required by the state, sharply reducing 
the
 cost of buying power on the expensive spot market.

 But the governor said this week that many generators are reluctant to sign
 long-term contracts until they know how the utilities will pay their debt for
 previous power purchases.

 The state called off all power alerts yesterday for the first time since
 mid-January, rescinding a Stage 1 alert declared Wednesday. Grid operators
 made the change after increased power supplies became available.

 ""The supply situation this week has gradually been improving,"" said Lorie
 O'Donley, a spokeswoman with the California Independent System Operator,
 which manages most of the state's power supplies.

 However, she said the improvements shouldn't deter consumers from
 conservation.

 ""It is good news to be out of electrical emergencies but we just want to
 remind everybody that we are looking at a long-term power supply situation
 here,"" she said. ""And the high-demand summer is just around the corner. So
 we would ask that people continue with their conservation efforts.""

 In San Francisco yesterday, state power regulators decided unanimously that
 the Department of Water Resources is responsible for buying any power that
 cash-strapped utilities are unable to generate or buy on their own -- no 
matter
 what price wholesalers are charging.

 But the PUC voted 3-2 against taking action that would have allowed the
 DWR to receive a portion of ratepayer revenues from the utilities to help
 cover the cost of buying electricity.

 The state, through the DWR, was authorized by a recent law to buy power
 for the utilities. Edison and PG&E have such low credit ratings that no power
 companies will sell to them. SDG&E's rating is much better, but its debt also
 was mounting.

 The DWR purchases that portion of electricity beyond what the utilities
 provide through their own generating plants and through existing long-term
 contracts. But the DWR has refused to buy power beyond a certain price.
 That means more last-minute power purchases on the expensive spot market.

 The utilities and the state had disagreed over how the DWR will be
 reimbursed -- whether through state bonds or ratepayer dollars -- and the
 extent of its power-buying role.

 The author of the bill authorizing the long-term contracts, Assemblyman
 Keeley, said the legislation's intent was to fully cover the one-third of the
 power that utilities purchased on the spot market, either through extended
 contracts or through the state ISO.

 Staff writer Karen Kucher and The Associated Press contributed to this
 report.

mentioned the right for Enron to check at any time the code source
etc,he wanted to request Enron to pay his fees in the case D-G
disappeared.In any case,if you are still interested,we are ready to
use your escrow account to make things simpler.Moreover,I am

Vince,

 If you take a cab, ask them to take you to the College of Business
building at the corner of 21st and Speedway.  The main entrance to the
business school is on Speedway, across from the old gymnasium.  Come in the
main entrance, which has a large, glass structure, and you will be on the
second floor.  Go to your left and ride up the first set of escalators to
the third floor.  When you step off of the escalators, you'll be facing
north and continue in that direction through two sets of glass doors into
the northern side of the building.  This is where most faculty offices are
found.  My office is 3.218, which is in the northwest corner of the
building.

 If you have any problems, you should be able to ask directions from
most anyone in the halls.  I will look for you around 11:00 on Thursday, and
will be happy to provide any other transportation that you need.  Please let
me know if you have any other questions.

 Jim

Jim,

I can  take a cab or get a rental car from the airport  (thanks for your
kind offer).
I shall appreciate, however, if you could drop me off at the hotel before
dinner.

The time allocation for my speech is about right. I think I shall need
about 90
minutes.

Please let me know where we can meet on Thursday.  I shall be at an
off-site
on Wednesday but you can reach me on my cell phone (713 410 5396)
and by sending a cc message to my AOL address: vkaminski@aol.com.

Vince,

     I could pick you up at the airport, or you could rent a car and come
to campus.  I have made tentative plans for us to go to lunch with some
other faculty between 11:30 and 12:00, and then you would have some time to
visit with Sheridan and perhaps with some other faculty members as well
between lunch and my class.

     Sheridan and a guest speaker from his class, Suresh Sundaresan from
Columbia, will be joining us for dinner.  I could provide transportation to
your hotel, and pick you up for dinner as well if you consider that to be
the most convenient alternative.

     I will have a PC available in the classroom, with Office 2000 and
windows NT.  You could use powerpoint with no difficulty from that machine,
if that's most convenient.  You could simply email the presentation, and I
would have it for you if you prefer.

     How much time would you like?  I would like to reserve about 30
minutes at the end for a general discussion of issues related to real
options, and about 30 minutes at the beginning of class for some remarks
regarding the final assignment and a class evaluation by the students
(which
is required for all classes).  At some point, we should take a brief break,
so that would leave approximately 1.5 to 2 hours for your presentation if
you would like that flexibility.  Otherwise, I could take up the ""slack"".

     I look forward to seeing you on Thursday.

     Jim

Vince,

     I am traveling at this time, attending a NSF meeting in Washington.
However, I wanted to touch base regarding plans for your presentation in my
class on real options next Thursday (May 4).  As you recall, the class is
from 3:30 to 6:30, and you could plan to take a significant part of that
time for your presentation.  Sheridan Titman has agreed to join us after
his
class at about 6:00 for a 30 minute ""panel discussion"" with the students on
issues related to real options in practice.l

     I am not sure about your travel plans, but we would be happy to plan
lunch on Thursday with several of my colleagues.  I would also be delighted
to be your host for dinner on Thursday night if that is convenient for you.

     I'll be back in my office on Monday, and will look forward to
hearing from you.

"Les -
Here's the latest list of unit contingent deals in need of unit names. I've 
tried referring to your unit name list and entering them myself, but it looks 
like some delivery points correspond to more than one unit. I.E. Navajo can 
originate from LV Cogen OR Saguaro Power. If you could add these unit names 
into the deals, or let me know what they are so I can enter them, it would be 
much appreciated.

"To summarize and in response to our meeting last week:

1.   I am attaching the list of Non-Disclosure Agreements I maintain for the 
Enron Net Works Team and my proposed form for the EnronOffline Team.  Please 
let me know if this form meets with your approval or if there are any changes 
you would like.  This list will be circulated to the Project Offline Team 
Wednesday afternoon.  Mark, could you please provide me a list of the people 
you would like the list circulated to.

2.  All future requests for NDAs for the EnronOffline Team should be directed 
to me instead of Kay Young.  The request for the NDA should be sent to me by 
email and include the legal name of the company, the contact at the company 
and the company's address.  In addition, each request for an NDA for 
EnronOffline should be clearly indicated as a Project Offline NDA (since I 
prepare many other NDAs for Enron Net Works).  At the request of the 
dealmaker, I usually send the NDAs directly to the counterparty by email, so 
an email address should be included.  If you would like the NDA sent some 
other way, please let me know (hard copy sent by mail or fedex, fax, etc.).

3.  I will work with Travis (or other ENA lawyers, as necessary ) to 
circulate and revise any comments from counterparties.  I will then circulate 
the NDAs for signature.  When fully executed, the originals will be filed 
with Kay Young.  Please note that copies of ALL Network agreements should 
also be filed with Lisa Lees (the original should always be filed with her, 
except Confidentiality Agreements, which get filed with Kay Young).

4.  Kay Young will review my list to determine if there are any NDAs that she 
has prepared that should be added to the list.

If I have missed anything or if you have any comments or questions please 
call me at x33399.

location we choose.  i'm cool with the spotswig residence if he's
offering.
5 votes for jody....who else is out there?

O.K...O.K...After all these years (Rick would definitely get a kick out of
this), I guess I'm in.  It was much more fun to sit back and laugh at Ty and
Dan each week though.  I'm sure I'll pay for that now.

Ty, if you can get John Sz. on board, he and I can put together a team this
year if you're still looking to fill a spot.  I need John for sure though.

I'll throw my house in the hat as well for a possible location to do the
draft.

We're 5 min. up from HWY 249 (by Willowbrook mall and the horse track), or
about 15min. from 45N/Beltway, or about 15min. from 290W/Beltway.

You make the call.....

September 8th it is!  franchise players to be named by 8/31!
draft will be 11-12 ish but where?  dan has volunteered his house
(pearland)...we can do it at mine (katy)...or anywhere else that might
be more centrally located?
jody has shown interest for years and even held the draft at his place
a few years back (the infamous pool basketball tournament...and the black
eyes which resulted from it....and let's not forget the HAWK/rotweiller -C
 URBY/warlock doberman showdown).  i say we give him the first
opportunity.

jody,
once we figure who has designated a franchise player then the remaining
teams without one have what we call a supplemental draft....basically a
catch up round.  there is one catch for those who pick franchise players....
when we draw numbers for the 1st ""official"" round they pick at the bottom
because they have the best players in hand.

sorry if i'm being the brother at arms but we need to finalize asap.  the
cost
is $225????  someone please confirm.   jody, john szallai is back in town
and wants in on the action and i will share a team with him if necessary
or you can???  we also vote at every draft what upcoming changes we
desire for the following year.

Malone has officially kicked Stockton off the team...therefore, I will be
jumping to the weak ASS north (A DREAM COME TRUE FOR ME) to join Malone
(although our name will change) and leave my Southern team in the capable
hands of my co-owner Jeff.  Dutch has said that he will be back.  Thus, that
is 3 teams spoken for.

Well it seems that Kevin has already done plenty of work on this.  I'm glad
to see that plenty of people are still interested and planning on being
there.  Dan's e-mail is bouncing back - so Ty try and get in touch with him,
and Jody if need be.

I'm assuming that the franchise player issue for next year will be voted on
at the draft, as usual.  Kiske, a motion to eliminate Tight Ends?

Current status quo - franchise players were voted on at last year's draft
and will be allowed for this season, but we will be voting on whether or not
to eliminate them for upcoming seasons.

Everyone comfortable with announcing your franchise player by August 31?

I'll designate my franchise player as Edgerrin James.
I vote for September 8th as well,  11 or 12 is fine with me.

Michael

Jeff,

I would like to invite you to an off-site meeting of John Griebling's 
organization
and the Research Group. 

Date:   April 27 - April 29
Location:  Breckenridge, Colorado


As you know, John Griebling is managing the network design and construction 
project
currently under way in EBS. The Research Group is actively involved in this 
effort
which requires advanced quantitative skills in the area of stochastic 
optimization and
stochastic processes (for modeling and forecasting Internet traffic flows).

The objective of this meeting is to develop common language and accomplish 
transfer 
of skills between the two groups, to facilitate cooperation on this project 
in the future.

We are also inviting to this off-site senior management of EBS and plan to 
have
on the agenda several presentations about strategic directions of EBS. The 
effort
of network design and construction currently under way is  unprecedented in 
terms
of its scope and complexity and it is important  for technical people, who 
often have
highly specialized technical skills, to understand the broad picture.

I would appreciate if you could join us for Friday afternoon (April 28) and
Saturday (April 29). I understand  that you have commitments on Thursday and 
Friday 
morning. We have reorganized the tentative agenda of the meeting to devote
Friday afternoon to more general topics.

Vince

Subject: Assignment of Irving Pulp Master ISDA Agreement

Sara,

If appears from discussions with Mark Bettle today that interest levels at 
the top management of J.D. Irving is minimal to consolidate business under 
one master ISDA agreement.  As a result it seems prudent to move forward to 
assign the current Enron Canada master ISDA agreement over to Enron North 
America.

From my earlier conversations with Bryan Burnett he would support this 
decision.  I have not spoken personally with the originator of the  Enron 
Canada master ISDA, Chris Calger, but it is my understanding he would also 
support this move.  

Would you please take steps to get this done as soon as possible.  

If there are any questions, please call.

JH.

Bob and Corinna,
Here are the versions of the MOU your lawyer will need to review.  As
expected, some of the items just did not make the bar to warrant a
change.  Specifically:
an actual date for the released product will not go on the MOU.
Customers who particpate in the JDP have a high degree of touch and
disclosure with MS.  Although we are glad to discuss dates and they draw
near with the customer we do not promise anything from the beginning
(though this hardly matters now considering the date).
The line in #4 that was cut and pasted to #17 has been placed back in
#4.  This is due to the placement of the topic in #4.  The rest of #17,
specifically stating that there is NO COST TO THE CUSTOMER has been left
in on #17, and I'll probably incorporate this for future use.  It is a
good addition.
#10 on Microsoft's section has been removed.  It is clearly rednundant
and not necessary.  We already say there is absolutely no cost to the
customer.

If this is agreeable (I have included the red lined version, so your
lawyers can review), the final version with those changes have also been
included.  Please print, sign and return.

Thanks!
JamMo!

Please look into this and let me know of any problems in making these changes.

**************************************************
Michael has been in and out of the hospital the last 10 days with
fevers.  They're trying to figure out the cause, and no doubt will do
so.  In the meantime, he's in need of blood -- some 7-8 units over the
next couple weeks.  If any of you, your friends, spouses, co-workers,
etc., have some O+ blood in your system that you wouldn't mind donating,
I know Michael would welcome it.

Rather than rush down to MD Anderson to donate, please give me a call
first, and I can give you some of the specifics you'll need.

Thanks.

Bob,

I am writing to you to confirm my voice-mail message regarding the SEC deposition.
I decided that I don't really  need a counsel to assist me at my deposition before
the Commission. I may retain a lawyer of my own choice to give me general 
advice about the procedures and I shall send you the bill for reimbursement
of expenses. 

My decision should not be interpreted as a statement about Mr. Levy's qualifications.
I found him to be an exceptionally competent lawyer. My only regret is that I shall not be given
an opportunity to spend more time with him and learn from his experience. 

You may recall that  I have indicated to you a few weeks ago that my intention was to waive my
right to a counsel.  This was before I had the pleasure to meet Mr. Levy in person. 

I am sending you the copy of my fax to the SEC as an attachment to a separate message.

Re-Regulates Utility Generation


California PUC Adopts DWR Regulations, Re-Regulates Utility Generation
DWR power to go only to SCE and PG&E customers, for now
Obligates SCE and PG&E to make DWR whole for its unrecovered costs
Re-regulates all generation retained by the 3 IOUs
Each to file cost-based rates
Rate base to be net depreciated book value, less recovered stranded costs
The California PUC adopted emergency regulations for the delivery and
payment mechanisms the state*s Department of Water Resources (DWR) will use
in fulfilling its electric purchase and sale obligations under emergency
bill AB 1X.  Under the provisions of AB 1X, which the PUC apparently had
confidence would be enacted without significant change, the PUC requires the
DWR to sell the power it purchases directly to the retail end use customers
of Southern California Edison (SCE) and Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E).
Since the law requires the PUC to ensure that DWR recovers all of the costs
of its power purchase program and yet also limits the recovery to only an
allocable portion of the utilities* currently frozen energy charges, the PUC
recognizes the possibility that DWR*s costs may not be fully recovered at
certain times.  The PUC makes SCE and PG&E liable to pay any shortfalls to
ensure DWR recovers its costs on as current a basis as possible, but
suggests it is open to further consideration of this policy.
URG Assets Re-Regulated
The PUC orders the three utilities to each make *Advice Letter* filings to
establish cost-based rates for their URG.  The rate set will be made
retroactive to whenever the utility stopped bidding its retained generation
into to the PX, which SCE and PG&E said they stopped doing on 12/28/00.  The
two utilities said they stopped participating in the PX day-of and day-ahead
markets on 01/19/01.
The PUC directs the utilities to calculate their cost of capital-related
revenue requirements using the amounts in their respective Transition Cost
Balancing Accounts (TCBA) as the rate base.  The TCBA reflects the net book
value of utility generation assets less the recovery of those assets*
stranded costs.  The PUC will allow utilities to record in a memorandum
account the difference between this reduced rate of return component of
revenue requirements and their last PUC authorized rate of return for the
same assets, for possible future use in adjusting the TCBA-based rates.  The
amounts in these memorandum accounts will represent the difference between
their current allowed returns and what they *may have earned had these
generation costs been recovered under traditional cost of service ratemaking
in place prior to restructuring.*  The cost-based rates so determined, the
PUC says, would comply with the principle that ratepayers pay just and
reasonable rates, and as costs change would be subject to adjustment.
The PUC decides that SCE, PG&E, and San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) should
use their *utility retained generation* (URG) in the following order, to: 1)
serve their existing customers at cost-of-service based rates; 2) sell power
at cost-based rates to other California investor-owned utilities; and 3)
sell or barter excess power from URG to minimize future costs.  The PUC
directs that if any surplus generation exists, it should first be offered to
other California IOUs at cost-based rates, with any net proceeds to benefit
in-state ratepayers.  URG consists of utility-owned generation and long-term
purchased power contracts.
Since the December 15, 2000 order from the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC) ending the investor-owned utilities* obligation to sell
all of their energy produced through the Power Exchange (PX) and buy all of
their energy requirements from the PX (the so-called *buy/sell
requirement*), utilities had no regulatory direction for using and pricing
their retained generation.  In lieu of an evidentiary hearing, because of
the need to protect the public interest during this time of nearly
continuous Stage 3 supply emergencies, the PUC now provides this direction.
The PUC makes SDG&E a party to the URG aspects of its order, while the PUC
does not apply the DWR delivery and pricing rules to SDG&E, at this time.
The AB 1X law does not exclude SDG&E*s retail customers from receiving DWR
power, but the PUC opts not to require DWR power to go them at this time.

In this interim order adopted on 01/31/01, the PUC says it does not end the
rate freeze, set an interim valuation, or otherwise provide a basis for
ending the rate freeze.  As far as it addresses the pricing and use of
utilities* retained generation, the order only sets an interim basis for
pricing the power utilities continue to produce and provide to their
customers since the effectively defunct PX no longer fulfills this function.

Residual Pricing of DWR Power
Because of the provisions of AB 1X, which was enacted the day after the PUC
adopted its order, the PUC must price DWR power residually, or as a
percentage of what each SCE and PG&E retail end use customer currently pays
them for energy.  The utilities* energy charges are currently frozen at
different levels for each utility and each customer class.  The percentage
is calculated by dividing (1) the amount of power provided by DWR and
delivered by the utility, by (2) the total amount of power generated or
purchased by the utility and the amount of power in item (1).  The amount of
power purchased by the utility includes purchases from QFs and others for
resale, as well as any energy they purchase in the ISO*s real time market.
This percentage or ratio will be calculated daily.
The PUC provides the following example, if a utility generates and purchases
750 MWh of power and delivers along with it 250 MWh of DWR power for a total
of 1,000 MWh, each customer owes DWR 25% of the energy charge in their rates
for the power they used that day.
Utilities will collect these amounts from customers on behalf of DWR and
hold the amounts in trust for DWR.
As the law requires the calculation of the amounts to be collected on the
basis of the megawatt hours DWR actually purchases and delivers, while
calculating the amounts it is entitled to recover from utilities* retail
customers in dollars of costs, there is a built in potential for DWR*s costs
to be under recovered, depending on how the actual price DWR pays for each
MWh matches up with the utilities* existing, frozen energy charges.
The PUC says that making the utilities liable for any shortfall in the
recovery of DWR*s costs *satisfies the legislative concern that the State
recover the funds expended.*  If the two cash-strapped, nearly bankrupt
utilities are liable for substantial amounts to make DWR whole, these
amounts would likely only add to the approximately $12 billion in unpaid,
overdue purchased power costs they have already accumulated.
Following the provisions of AB 1X, the PUC sets the DWR price of power upon
resale as equal to DWR*s purchased power costs, plus administrative costs,
transmission and scheduling costs, and other related costs, less any
overpayments DWR may subsequently recover from suppliers.
Again following the provisions of AB 1X, the PUC directs DWR to retain title
to its power until sold to the utilities* retail end use customers, and
reminds that under the new statute *neither the full faith and credit nor
the taxing power of the State of California may be pledged for the payment
for any obligation.*  The PUC orders the two cash-strapped utilities to
deliver DWR power to retail customers and directs the utilities to take no
ownership or other interest in DWR power, acting only in an administrative
capacity as billing agents for DWR.
The PUC*s interim order is posted on its web site at:
http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/PUBLISHED/FINAL_DECISION/4867.htm
For your convenience, attached is an MS Rich Text Format file containing
this analysis and full summary.
Citation: The PUC approved its interim order, Decision 01-01-061, adopting
emergency regulations on the delivery and payment mechanism for DWR power
and directing utilities on the use and pricing of utility retained
generation on January 31, 2001, in SCE and PG&E*s consolidated rate
stabilization cases, Application numbers 00-11-038 and 00-11-056, of which

Dear Vince,

As you may know, FERC approved the Neptune transmission proposal on July 26
and the organizers (me among them) are now preparing to hold on open season
starting September 10 to sell 80 percent of the capacity on a firm basis. A
diagram of the system legs is on www.NeptuneRTS.com.

Some of the bidders in that open season will be gencos with little or no
experience in trading, some will be load-serving entities, some will be
power marketers.

There is likely to be interest in a Neptune hedge, and I wondered how we
could engage Enron in an exploration of its willingness to provide such
hedges. Essentially, bidders will be going long the various spreads (Nova
Scotia - New York, New Brunswick - Boston, PSE&G - Zone J, etc etc) and we
would like to encourage someone like Enron (I know there is no one quite
like Enron but you know what I mean) to be willing to offer transmission
hedges.

It may also interest you that FERC gave Neptune approval to hold 20 percent
of the capacity for sale in the short-term markets. We (the development
group) see that as a desirable exposure to these spreads for Neptune's
equity investors and are in the equity markets now securing a second tranche
of development capital, and will return in early 2002 for a sizeable amount
of permanent equity assuming the bids received in September - October yield
sufficient interest to finance the majority of the project in the debt
market.

That's the plan, the primary virtue of which is that the authorities have
allowed us to put it to a market test this fall. Let me know if you'd like
to pursue this. I will make similar initiatives to several other entities
later this week.

"Chris,

Per our conversation, I am attaching  a sample form of ISDA for both a 
Canadian corporate and a Canadian governmental.  With the governmental, the 
proposed form of legal opinion attached to the ISDA Schedule would have to be 
modified depending on your particular situtation (see footnotes in opinion).  
As I also mentioned, we are making some revisions to the guaranty we are 
getting from Hydro-Quebec in response to comments from counsel, and we may 
want to make some of the same changes to guarantees we receive from any 
governmental guarantor.  If you end up having a governmental guarantor, let 
me know and I'll send you down the revisions.

By copy of this email to Joe Hunter on the Confirmation Desk, I am asking him 
to email you copies of the form of Omnibus Confirmation and Annex A thereto 
for an ECC/Canadian Counterparty Deal.  I have to say that if you end up 
transacting with a governmental entity, our form of confirmation will not 
include the reps and warranties required to transact with such 
counterparties, since we never trade financial with governmentals prior to 
execution of a master.  If you go down that road we may have to come up with 
some kind of form, but the best route is to get the ISDA in place first.

RE your inquiry about the General Terms and Conditions of Confirmation ( 
Annex A to the Confirmation ) and Credit and Other Special Provisions (Annex 
B to the Confirmation) that were attached to the 9/1/99 ""Summary of Proposed 
Agreement Between Enron and Catalytica Combustion Systems, Inc. (""CCSI"")"" ( 
which I understand was sent to Catalytica) , I went through all the E-Mails I 
had sent or received that attached the Confirmation or the Summary of 
Proposed Agreement as an exhibit, but I can't seem to find one that included 
these Annexes A and B. I've asked a clerk in the department to deliver to 
both you and Sara the copy of Annexes A and B that were attached to the paper 
version of the 9/1 Summary of Proposed Agreement in my files. Perhaps one of 
you will recollect from whom the Annexes were obtained, so we can retrieve 
them in electronic format and append them to the most current draft 
Confirmation.

Regarding your question about credit terms, they are embodied in Annex B. 
Regarding our exposure to Catalytica credit between execution and payment, 
remember that we will not execute the Option Repurchase Agreement until we 
receive CCSI's cash via wire transfer ( this was the deal Brad agreed to when 
he suggested we delete the receipt of CCSI's payment as an express condition 
to effectiveness of the Xonon Implementation Agreement with GE, the 
effectiveness of which agreement is in turn an express condition to 
effectiveness of the Option Repurchase Agreement). In short, my understanding 
is that we would not deliver the Option Repurchase or execute and deliver the 
Xonon Implementation Agreement until we had a good wire transfer from CCSI of 
the full payment amount. Perhaps we should add that stipulation expressly to 
the Option Repurchase Agreement and consider whether it would then be 
appropriate to delete Annex B. Note in this regard, however, that if CCSI 
were to default under other provisions of the derivative, I believe we would 
be seeking payment from CCSI for termination expenses and the like, but I 
don't know if this justifies the credit provision.

Vince,

We had spoken a few weeks back, but were unable to meet due to our 
schedules.  I will be back in Houston next week (August 21st), and would 
appreciate the opportunity to meet with you and take your advice. 

As I may have mentioned to you, I am interested in exploring opportunities 
that are more US focused.  I think Paula Corey has already forwarded my 
resume to you.  However, I have attached it to this note just in case.  



I would really appreciate the opportunity to meet with you next week, and 
would be grateful if you could let me know what time fits best with your 
schedule.  I look forward to hearing from you.

Regards,



Rahul

"Thanks for your message.  I thought that John did have responsibility for 
risk, and I am glad to have that clarified.   Kristin worked for me for 
several years as the risk lead for ENA power and joined Barry at EBS last 
August, so I knew that you all had a great resource there!  

I will look forward to a follow-up conversation to explore where we may have 
potential solutions for EBS that can be borrowed or modified from EWS.  Just 
give me a call when you are ready to get back together.  --Sally

Thanks for taking the time to meet with me today.  You gave me some valuable 
insights and suggestions.

I do want to correct one misstatement that I made.  John DOES have ownership 
of the risk books.  This area of responsibility is being handle by a lady 
named Kristen Albrecht who reports to Barry Pearce who is in charge of 
trading operations.

I am looking forward to meeting with you again soon.

"I understand that you spoke with Mark Taylor about eliminating references to 
individuals in confirms.  I need to speak with you about the ISDA, omnibus 
and industrial master templates under revision and whether the drafted 
language conforms to your proposal.  In that regard, you may recall that swap 
templates were given to you several months ago.  The legal group is 
concluding a massive form review which necessitates confirm changes.  
Thanks.  Sara"
"Hi Matt,

This is the document that I referenced in my voice mail.  It would be great 
if it could be compared against the  agreement for the Wilton Center.  I will 
call later to see if you've had any luck.  As you can guess, this is on a 
short fuse.

Here's the agreement I referenced in my voice mail.  We will change it so

Subject: Kendall New Century Development,LLC; Plano Letter of Intent

Ben:

Attached is the ComEd Letter of Intent to interconnect at the Plano TSS.  In 
addition, ComEd has included a cover letter which indicates a significant 
level of uncertainty regarding a '01 interconnect at Plano.  Under the 
guidelines of Appendix K of ComEd's Open Access Transmission Tarriff, we are 
required to execute this LOI within 15 days of the date of receipt (7/7/00) 
in order to maintain our current position (6/12/00) in the ComEd queue.  If 
we execute after 7/22/00, then the date our date in the ComEd queue becomes 
the date of execution of the LOI.

Appendix K provides that once the LOI is executed, ComEd shall provide Enron 
with an Interconnection Study (IS)  and Project Diagram (PD) within 45 days 
(ComEd has the option to extend another 30 days, if needed).  The IS and PD 
will provide Enron with a description of the upgrades required and an 
estimate of the proposed allocation of the cost to interconnect.  The IS and 
PD do not provide Enron with information on transmission availability (ie 
ATC), this would be addressed by the Interconnection Feasibility Study 
currently in progress by ComEd (I am expecting the results of this IFS in the 
next 2-3 weeks).  

ComEd informed me in a discussion yesterday afternoon that their current 
interpretation of AppendixK provides that if the commercial start date of a 
proposed IPP project is delayed, that there is no impact to that proposed 
projects' queue position relative to competing projects provided that all 
interconnection milestones (LOI, PD, Notice To Proceed, and IA) remain 
current.  ComEd further indicated that such a delay would result in a project 
with an inferior queue position (i.e. Wizvest) being charged with the 
necessary system upgrade costs even though their project would come on line 
prior to the project with the superior queue position.  I will request that 
this interpretation be confirmed by ComEd in writing to Enron. (This 
interpretation obviously has a large value implication for the Torrence site 
relative to the Wizvest planned '01 interconnect).

I will review this letter on the plane to Houston this afternoon.  I believe 
that it authorizes ComEd to spend up to $100K on engineering related to the 
interconnect design.  It also addresses the ordering and payment 
responsibilities for long-lead equipment required to facilitate the proposed 
interconnection.  Based upon our development budget discussions earlier this 
week,  we obviously do not want to incurr long-lead equipment charges prior 
to having a clear value proposition in our sights.  I will have 
recommendations ready for you on these issues by Wednesday.  I am 
simaltaneously forwarding it to Kay Mann for her review so that we will be in 
a position to move forward to execution prior to 7/22 if we choose to do so.  
From a legal standpoint, this is ComEd's boilerplate LOI.  I believe that we 
executed a similar LOI for Wilton Center in early 1999 under Des Plaines 
Green Land Development, L.L.C. 

Call me if you wish to discuss.

Dow Industrials               -113.16     -1.01%   11144.27

The Nasdaq surged to another record high while the Dow pulled back from
early gains in moderate trading volume.

Investor focus shifted to Tuesday's meeting of the Federal Open Market
Committee, which is the Fed's interest rate policy-making body.
Although few market watchers expect the Fed to raise rates at the
meeting given uneasiness over the Year 2000 issue, speculation has
grown that the Fed may change its ""bias"" or predisposition towards
future interest rate hikes.

General Electric (NYSE:GE) shares rose 1 13/16 (+1.19%) to 153 11/16 on
continuing momentum from the company's announcement on Friday of a 3-
for-1 stock split, a 17% increase in its quarterly dividend to 41 cents
per share, and an expansion of its share repurchase program,

In addition to the GE stock split announced on Friday, several
prominent companies announced splits last week and today, including
Oracle Corp. (Nasdaq:ORCL) 2-for-1, Red Hat (Nasdaq:RHAT) 2-for-1,
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. (NYSE:MWD) 2-for-1, Check Point
Software (Nasdaq:CHKP) 2-for-1, Novellus Systems (Nasdaq:NVLS) 3-for-1,
and CMGI (Nasdaq:CMGI).  Novellus Systems shareholders were excited
today--the stock closed up 33.36% (up 28 18/32) to 113 9/16!
Our Smart!Splits Report forecasted the GE, Oracle, and CMGI splits.

Merger mania hit the drug sector again today with news that drug giant
Pharmacia & Upjohn (NYSE:PNU) and life sciences company Monsanto
(NYSE:MTC) will combine in a ""merger of equals"" transaction.  Investors
in both companies reacted negatively to the news, as shares of Monsanto
closed down 5 1/8 (-12.28%) to 36 5/8 and shares of Pharmacia & Upjohn
closed down 3 1/8 (-6.22%) at 47 1/8.  Monsanto shareholders were
particularly disappointed because they have been pushing for an
acquisition involving Monsanto, or at least its agribusiness division,
for some time, but given the merger of equals nature of this
transaction, they will not receive a significant premium for their
shares.  Other drug stocks ended mixed, with Merck (NYSE:MRK) edging up
3/16 (+0.28%) to 66 3/4, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) down 7/16 (-1.32%) to 32
13/16, and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) down 3 (-3.16%) to 91 7/8.

Please let me know who will prepare credit (since the CP knows my phone

As indicated by this ex parte notice, Edison is planning to meet with Bilas
this week before the continuation meeting on Thursday presumably to try to
weaken his opposition to the July 1 cut off of direct access.  Edison's
comments on the proposed decision say that over 6% of their load has
switched to direct access during the July 1 to September 6 time frame,
resulting in a total of over 7% of load being served by direct access over
their entire system at present.  While it appears Bilas is still a strong
proponent of allowing direct access and should still advocate reducing the
DWR contract commitements instead of restricting customer options, should
Enron, or AReM get in to see Bilas (and possibly Brown) to try to prevent
any backsliding on the 13th.  We have a right to a meeting with Bilas.  A
meeting with Brown would have to be noticed today or be held only with his
advisor, Dave Gamson. I would recommend we try for both.

"An update on two of the items that we discussed before you went out of town:

Due Diligence Teams for Acquisitions Identified

I have worked with my operations controllers in EWS and have identified a 
short list of individuals that we could use in the due diligence efforts on 
potential acquisitions.  We have identified our target teams for due 
diligence efforts around commodities.  While each person on the list has 
other duties currently, all have back ups that would allow them to be devoted 
to projects as they arise.  I will review this list continually and update it 
as I identify other qualified operations personnel who could do an excellent 
job as part of a due diligence team.  I mentioned that Kristin Albrecht had 
created a due diligence check list while she was in London on the MG 
acquisition.  We will hold a session in the next 10 days to review this 
checklist so that all are prepared.  Let me know if you are interested in the 
names on my list.  Also let me know if there is a pending due diligence 
effort.  

Dedicated Support Named for Transportation Business

I met with Dan Reck and Chris Kravas week before last and have reviewed the 
executive summary from the consulting team.  I followed up with Brent Price 
(my operations controller for EGM) to review his plan for creating an 
appropriate infrastructure to support that business.  Currently, Todd Hall 
and Mike Perun on Brent's team are assessing what needs to be done.  Todd has 
other responsibilities and Dan Reck was concerned about the amount of time 
that Todd would have.  Brent has since recruited Shelley Stubbs to play the 
lead role over operations integration for Webmodal.  She will be returning to 
Houston from the London office by the end of March.  She will be able to 
split her time starting next week to focus on Webmodal.  Todd will stay 
involved until Shelley is devoted fulltime at the end of March.  We will also 
keep Mike Perun on the assignment working for Shelley.  Shelley is expected 
to be in Houston next week, and I will sit in on meetings with her next week 
regarding our plans.  I will keep you posted. "

"Mike,

The Research Group is looking at some counterintuitive results we could 
observe
 recently in the Value-at-Risk for the aggregate storage book.

I think that the results the system is producing are incorrect and
that we should use instead the number produced by
straightforward addition of Value-at-Risk numbers for the storage book
subportfolios.

We are actively working with the IT to review the code and locate the source
of the  problem. We should also review the interactions between the 
spreadsheet
that contains the storage book and the Value-at-Risk system database.

"I got the package on the 2002 PBS special.  We are already doing a 
significant PBS sponsorship in connection with a series based on Dan Yergin's 
(author of The Prize) new book ""The Commanding Heights"".  We have looked at 
numerous Public Broadcasting sponsorships in the past, but the ratings are so 
low they tend to be a very inefficient means of reaching our target 
audience.  We made an exception for yergin's series because it focusses on 
the role of free markets and their relationship with governments over time.  
I'll ask Margaret Allen to handle the decline."

Subject: Re: LV Cogen Turbine Agreement  

Kay - sorry I have taken so long to review the attachments to your e mail.

I have comments that I would like to address in a conference call with GE 
(Lee Johnson), Peter Thompson of AKLLP (history of changes - especially in 
the guarantees for HR and MW output).
 Basically, the figures for HR and Output should remain as was struck. 
(Trivial - but Lee knows what I have gone through with the EPC contractor on 
HR and MW (kW) guarantees.)
Electrical Output should stay at 43,994 kW rather than change to 43,988 kW. 
Same goes for the specific value, and H/R guarantee (8969 btu/kWh) and 
specific value.
What is really puzzling is when I went back to a December BO contract, I had 
a kW guarantee over 48 MWs each, at an 8800 + HR.  This is with conditions as 
set in the existing version.  Where did the MWs go?

I need to understand the history of changes to the BO contract, and be sure 
we are not leaving value on the table.  That is why Kay, if possible _ I'd 
like a quick conference call that would include the party making the changes 
to HR and MW output guarantees.

Also - I did not see the addition of 4 more HMI's as needed for LVCII.  The 
power system stabilizers were in the scope of supply - but I could not find 
additional HMI's (whatever that entails).

I believe we can knock this out by tomorrow to meet the April 10 date listed 
in your e mail.

Please call me should you have any questions.

Greetings:
This should be an interesting call.  I also have MTA working on how much
Edison and PG&E have spent each day on their print, radio, and TV ads.
Companies who have looming bankruptcies usually do not run daily
multi-million dollar ad campaigns.

Details:

TELECONFERENCE Harvey Rosenfield, NETTIE HOGE and Harry Snyder ""warn against
phony bankruptcy threats, say legislature, Governor, PUC are getting
stampeded by Edison, PG&E""

Normally we inactivate old deals on the first Sunday of the month that lies closest to the 10th.
The job takes a long time and is run over the weekend. This Sunday (the 8th) we will inactivate
all the March deals. This is done to reduce the volume of deals in Sitara so that performance
(speed & stability) can be enhanced. The only application that this really affects is Position Manager.
Our IT department has asked if they can do this for all the April deals on May 6th next month.


Any concerns, please call the Sitara Hotline 853-7049

Thanks

I talked with Lee Papyoti about the Equistar buybacks.  I created deal 675086 as an ENA buyback.  However, after you have allocated the volume between the Equistar plants, please get with Lee and have him look over everything.

Daren,

I am trying to make up the gas for ENA deals on meter 1552,8024,1062, (deals 240061, 378904, 394489, 487588).  Per Anita, these need to be kept whole.  I have the option of a buyback or swing on 1373....but, there is not enough gas at meter 1373 to do this.  Please let me know if there is another way I can achieve this.

We have a buyback under HPL (#586534).  ENA had only 7,000/day scheduled at mtr 1373 in Feb.  In reviewing the daily volumes in POPS, I didn't see any days with flow under 18,000.  So, we should not need a buyback for ENA.  Any shortages should be allocated to the HPL ticket.

Daren - Thu has asked if I can extend deal 343421 thru Feb. '01.  I told her I didn't have the authority to do this.  It is for Equistar.  It looks like it is a term deal expiring Jan. '01.   She wants it added to keep the ENA deal whole.  What do you suggest?

Aimee,

This is the deal for Equistar.  There is not enough gas at meter 1373 to keep the ENA deal whole.  I need this deal to create buyback.  This was out there last month and Anita told me to get the deal extended.  Let me know if there is another way.

"Good News:  Lenny weakening - max. winds down to 130 mph and pressure rising
Bad News:  The darn thing won't get moving - still just drifting a bit to the 
north & east

It's hard to describe which islands we care about on those maps - they're all 
so small they almost don't show up on the maps.  Luckily St. Thomas is to the 
west and a bit north of Lenny's current position

Here is a San Juan radar image that has St. Thomas marked and one of th

This message is pertaining to the celebration the Weather Team

We celebrated with Mike on Boss's Day Oct. 16th.

We the  Weather Team felt that time spent with our Boss was 
just as valuable as any token of appreciation.

We did Happy Hour @ Ninfa's

Mike you will not have a token in the staff meeting today 
however, please know that you are a great Boss too.

We still would like for you to join the others in celebrating
and we would like to have lunch with you.

"I was referencing your question about power and gas activity obligations when 
I raised the issue of putting it in the exhibits (which we have done pursuant 
to discussions we had last Friday)  My point on the fuel plan  was that 
Reagan deleted it, which was fine with me.  There is language in the contract 
addressing Enron's responsibility to buy gas and fuel oil for the facilities.

Subject: RE: MDEA question

Kay -- The fuel activity is so limited in scope that a separate Exhibit is 
questionable.  If you don't want fuel in the contract body, then why not make 
it a subset of the marketing plan.  Fuel activity is directly linked to power 
marketing when running their units. Thanks -- david

Hi David,

Reagan struck all the references to the Fuel Plan.  

I think the specific obligations would fit nicely in the scope exhibits, but 
we can put the stuff in the body of the contract if that's better for you.  
It just seemed that it would easier to work  with in the exhibits.

Kay -- Do you want detail about our specific power and gas activity 
obligations in the body of the contract, or in the Marketing Plan?  Is the 
fuel plan included in the Marketing Plan?

Cassandra,
I think Michael's issue is just one for you and Shona to worry about and try 
to simultaneously come up with a way to diffuse without bastardizing the 
process. .  I continue to say the we need to maintain the theme that speed 
and ""gut reaction"" is preferable to consensus and prosecutable evidence,  I 
feel so strongly about this that I would consider removing my team from 
involvement if politically correct, grammatically sound and properly 
researched reports that do not say anything or are stale or are full of 
ambiguity are the end result (see the internal audit report on 
Helsinki!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!).   I think the solution is make it clear that these reports are not to 
be used for prosecution but frank discussion.
I am right about this.
Please forward this to Shona/Sally/Mike or anyone else at your discretion 
(this is a compromise between Evil Ted and Zen Ted)

"Gentlemen,

I have made changes to the consolidation agreement, which I hope all will 
find acceptable:



(It does need a date or two.)

As for the termination agreement, here's what I suggest:



Do we want to address the purchaser's parent guaranty in both of the 
contracts, or just the consolidation agreement?  I would suggest that we make 
the guaranty a deliverable 30 days after execution of the contracts, which 
gives us time to get the Mitsui assignment done, as we expect to assign the 
contracts immediately.  That way, Mitsui can provide the guaranty, if 
necessary.  If ENA does provide the guaranty, we would want to have the 
ability to have it replaced with a suitable substitute guaranty from Mitsui.  

Sorry I missed your call.  It was a day of meetings.  I will be on the road 
tomorrow, but will check my voice mail.

Kay

Subject: Approval for transfer to EBS

John:

My name is Husnain Mirza. I have been working for ENA as Senior Specialist.  
I work in Andrea Reed's group, and report to her through L'Sheryl Hudson.  On 
August 8th, on behalf of Andrea Reed, L'Sheryl Hudson told me that with the 
dissolution of CTG, Andrea's group would change significantly and that there 
would be  no growth opportunities for me in this group. I was told that I 
should look for opportunities and growth elsewhere. 

After talking to numerous people in Enron, I found someone who told me to go 
to EBS. In EBS I approached Paul Trieschman of HR and Larry Lawyer. Paul 
Trieschman said he would check in EBS and forward my resume to people who 
might be looking to fill in vacant positions. Larry sent me to Ravi 
Thuraisingham, who was looking for someone with telecom background. Ravi 
talked to Jim Fallon, who was also looking for someone with telecom 
background. 

My background in Williams Communications Group, Inc., and specifically 
working on Fibre build business plan and related subjects, like cost study of 
fibre capacity, provided a direct fit with the position that Ravi and Jim 
wanted to fill. Ravi, after asking what I had done at Williams 
Communications, went to discuss my background with Jim Fallon. In the 
afternoon he called and made me an offer to join EBS. I accepted the offer. 
He told me that the projects that I will be doing are about Fibre build.

Upon receiving the offer, I went to Andrea Reed and told her about the offer 
and the excellent fit that this position has with my telecom background.  I 
told her that this position gives me great opportunity to make contribution 
to Enron's broadband efforts. Andrea, knowing that there are no growth 
opportunities for me in her group,  said she fully supports my transfer to 
EBS. She has already called Paul Racicot and told him of her support for my 
transfer to EBS (Please see Andrea's email below).  

Jim Fallon and Paul Racicot, understandably, are very sensitive about my 
transfer to EBS. They want to finally check it with you and get your support 
for my transfer. Everything related to my transfer has been finalised, except 
that Jim and Paul want to hear directly from you and get your approval.  
Andrea Reed fully supports my transfer and has no concerns about it. I would 
appreciate if you could O'K my transfer to EBS. I do not want to miss this 
opportunity, and would like to start as soon as possible.

Regards,

Husnain Mirza

Yes, we're having a few friends over Sat. night for ""Holiday Cheer"" which at

It's just an 8 to 10 kind of thing so even if you have other parties to go

The extent of FABULOUS in our Y2K plans is in the price of the bottle of 
champagne we're going to share at home that night.  I asked T if we should 
plan anything and got the ""quiet night at home"" reply.  That, of course, will 
change to ""Why didn't you plan anything?!"" around 12/29 or 30.

		 Subject: Re: QF Meeting Today--Highlights

For the last two days I participated in the negotiations between several QFs 
and the utilities regarding implementation of SBX 47. The goal of the meeting 
was to present a substantially complete ""Agreement of Long-Term Gas Purchase 
Arrangement""  to Battin this Thursday. Through this document they intend to 
describe what the parties have agreed to and the changes required in the bill 
to conform to the parties agreement. 

Attendees included PG&E and SDG&E (SCE is clearly opposed to the bill), 
Calpine, El Paso, Sithe and the CCC represented by White and Case. It appears 
that SDG&E's support for the bill is weakening with their mantra being ""if 
this doesn't guarantee a price reduction over the five years we won't support 
the bill."" We explained that the goal is not so much overall price reduction 
as price stabilization, with current period price reduction. PG&E clearly 
gets it. 

I was successful in introducing and inserting the financial hedging option 
into the Gas Agreement. Both PG&E and SDG&E are very supportive of such an 
option as they are currently prohibited from entering into such arrangements. 
It is less clear if the large QFs are supportive. Their primary goal is to 
find a safe harbor from the Wood decision for the next five years. I also 
believe the proposed gas procurement structure provides some option value to 
the larger QFs. 

Although it looks like our language will be in the Gas Agreement, I think we 
need to get some language in the bill itself. I am working with Sandi and 
Mike Day to make that happen. We may also want to add the concept of economic 
dispatch to the bill. Mike, do you have any suggested language that I could 
forward to Sandi and Mike Day? Finally, I suggest we try and set up 
individual meetings with the utilities (including SCE) to discuss our ideas 
further. I'm not sure what other conversations are occurring with the 
utilities, but I would be happy to set up the meetings with the appropriate 
people.

Thanks,

Mark

		 Subject: QF Meeting Today--Highlights

Despite the fact the bill, by itself, does not guarantee payment for overdue 
receivables, the QFs on today's call decided to go forward and push for SBX 
47 irrespective of the progress on SBX 33.  A press conference is planned for 
Friday by IEP.  Bowen, who heads up the first committee that this bill will 
go through will have hearings on this bill on Tuesday at the earliest.

Jan S-J asked every QF to fax to IEP a description of all QF generation and 
the zip code of each project so that they can begin lobbying specific 
legislators.  A significant PR push is planned.

SBX 47 is opposed by SCE.  PG&E's position appears more ambivalent.  One 
angle would be to try to get PG&E to support Enron's swap/SC language and 
make inclusion of such language a condition of PG&E's support.

"Interesting facts about this election  
------------------------------------- 
States won by Gore: 19 
States  won by Bush: 29 

Counties won by Gore: 677 
Counties won by Bush:  2,434 

Pop. of counties won by Gore: 127 million 
Pop. of counties won  by Bush: 143 million 


Sq miles of country won by Gore: 580,000 
Sq  miles of country won by Bush: 2,427,000 


Now Professor Joseph Olson  of the Hamline University School of Law in
St. 
Paul Minnesota has  produced another interesting new statistic. Professor

Olson looked up the  crime statistics for all of these counties and came
up 
with this:  

Avg Murder per 100,000 residents in counties won by Gore: 13.2 
Avg  Murder per 100,000 residents in counties won by Bush: 2.1 

Now, what area  of this country do you want electing the President of the

"You have to be careful reading those reports - the 145mph number is the 
current maximum wind speed - right at the eye wall - which is well to the 
south-east of St. Thomas.  The Weather channel this morning showed local 
radar indicating a lot of rain in the US 7 BVI but the storm center was 
pretty far away.  The real question is what direction will it go from here.  
If it heads out to the north east as predicted, no problems.  If it takes a 
turn to the north, direct hit.  I hadn't hard about the state of emergency 
but that could be due to rain related damage.

In case you need it to decipher some of the coordinates, the BVI is at 
roughly 18 25' N 64 40' W

Subject: Alliance Info Alert: FERC Report on Western Markets





At its special meeting today, FERC released the results of its eagerly 
awaited probe into California's summer power crisis, concluding that under 
certain circumstances, California ratepayers were subjected to unjust and 
unreasonable power rates due to California's ""seriously flawed"" market 
structure and rules in conjunction with tight demand and supply conditions 
throughout the West.

The FERC staff report on western markets and the causes of the Summer 2000 
Price Abormalities, entitled, Part I of Staff Report on U.S. Bulk Power 
Markets, is available at the following website: 
http://www.ferc.fed.us/electric/bulkpower.htm
In response, FERC issued an order proposing a series of sweeping structural 
changes to the California ISO and PX to help remedy the pricing problems, and 
solicited public comment by November 22.  A technical conference has also 
been scheduled for November 9, to discuss the proposed solutions and other 
remedies that might be suggested (details TBA).  While all four commissioners 
supported the order, the order stretched the Commission.  Chairman Hoecker 
and Comm. Breathitt expressed strong endorsements, while Comms. Hebert and 
Massey concurred, citing areas where they felt the Commission had either 
""over-reached"" or not gone far enough, as discussed below.  A final order is 
expected to be issued by year's end.

At the same time, the Commission warned California consumers of their 
continued risk of paying higher prices unless policy makers there resolve 
state issues, such as: (1) immediately implementing the availability of day 
ahead markets for power purchases; (2) development of demand responses; (3) 
siting of generation and transmission; and (4) assurance of sufficient 
reserve requirements.

Highlights of Proposed California Structural Remedy

In its order, FERC proposed a series of market overhauls, including:

(1) Eliminating the state's mandatory requirement that the state's 
investor-owned utilities buy and sell electricity through the PX, and allowing
these utilities to purchase electricity through forward contracts and other 
alternative mechanisms to manage supply risks.

(2) Requiring market participants to schedule 95 percent of their 
transactions in the day-ahead market and instituting a penalty charge for 
under-scheduling (in excess of five percent of hourly load requirements), in 
order to discourage over-reliance on the real-time spot market.

(3) Establishing independent, non-stakeholder governing boards for the ISO 
and PX.

(4) Modifying the current single price auction system by (a) imposing a 
temporary $150/MWh ""soft cap"" that prohibits supply bids in excess of $150 
from setting the market-clearing price for all bidders; (b) requiring sellers 
bidding above $150/MWh to report their bids to FERC on a confidential, weekly 
basis and provide certain cost support; and (c) requiring the ISO and PX to 
report monthly information on such bids.  The Commission's price mitigation 
measures would remain in effect through December 31, 2002.

(5) Declining to order retroactive refunds for the state's ratepayers and 
utilities, citing insufficient authority to do so, but subjecting sellers to 
potential refund liability for transactions from October 2, 2000 until 
December 21, 2002, but no lower than their marginal or opportunity costs, if 
FERC finds non-competitive behavior.

(6) Encouraging accelerated state siting approval and introduction of demand 
response management programs.

Separately, the draft order rejected the ISO's request for an extension of 
its current purchase price cap authority, and the PX's request for price 
capping authority.

Commissioner Responses

Comm. Herbert reluctantly concurred, noting that his decision may change when 
a final order is considered based on comments filed or testimony offered at 
the November 9 meeting.  He stressed that he would have preferred that the 
order address four areas: (1) eliminate all price controls in California 
markets; (2) abolish the single price auction entirely; (3) terminate the 
""buy and sell"" mandate in the PX; and (4) direct the ISO to address a long 
list of cited problems in its January 2001 RTO filing, rather than having the 
Commission prescribe specific remedies.

Hebert stated that while he was opposed in principle to the ""soft cap"" 
concept, if one had to be adopted, then the soft cap should increase 
incrementally increase over time at specific pre-announced dates.  He 
believes that this would serve to both encourage greater investment in 
facilities and additional forward contracting as well as provide an incentive 
for California regulators to address market design and other flaws.  Also, he 
would not have disbanded the stakeholder governing boards at this time, but 
allow the ISO and PX to address this issue in their January 2001 RTO 
filings.  In addition, he would not dictate risk management methods, 
preferring instead that market participants determine appropriate actions on 
their own.  Finally, he advised Californians not to be so environmentally 
focused that they do not realize their tremendous need for generation 
capacity.

Comm. Breathitt stated her approval of the Order while warning that FERC 
cannot allow the events of this past summer to reverse or slow the progress 
towards open and competitive markets.  She noted that it was the Commission's 
job to guide the market to self-correct and not to conduct ""command and 
control.""  She also commended the managers of the ISO and PX, saying that 
they have performed admirably.  However, she noted she is awaiting comments 
on the single price auction remedy and its accompanying confidential 
reporting requirements.

Comm. Massey concurred, but emphasized that he advocates a more aggressive 
approach.  He feels that the Congress has ""put its thumb on the scale"" in the 
Federal Power Act to protect consumers.  Stating that prices will continue to 
be unreasonable in the future, he believes that this Order moves in the right 
direction, by proposing solutions to identified problems such as an over 
reliance on the spot market, lack of demand response, the need to 
reconstitute governance of the ISO and PX and the elimination of the buy/sell 
mandate.  Comm. Massey specifically called for comments regarding whether the 
$150/MWh soft cap went far enough, whether FERC has the legal authority to 
issue refunds and to determine whether there should be a requirement for a 
certain percentage of forward contracting to hedge against the spot market 
price volatility.

Finally, Chairman Hoecker stated his strong support of the Order, but noted 
that this is ""no time to pull punches.""  He emphasized that the Commission 
needed frank comments from the industry.  He echoed Comm. Breathitt's warning 
that competition is at risk and that they needed to get the markets back on 
track.  Noting that the Commission lacked authority to order refunds, he 
stated that the responsibility rests with Congress.  Addressing 
jurisdictional issues, he stated that siting problems encountered at the 
state level are slowing the ""meandering transition"" to competition.  He feels 
that the state of California and FERC need to work together to resolve these 
problems and that FERC is not attempting to usurp power.  Rather, California 
is part of a broader interstate market and is dependent on the western region 
for reliable energy, thus placing the burden on federal action to make things 
work, Hoecker maintained.  The Chairman also said that the Commission will 
fully investigate and act upon complaints of market power abuse or further 
evidence provided by staff's ongoing investigation.

If you have any questions or comments, please call Jack Cashin at 
202/508-5499.

"Dan Walters: Davis vs. Lynch -- or is the feud a charade to shield the governor?
When Gov. Gray Davis named political operative Loretta Lynch to the state Public Utilities Commission -- and insisted that she become the PUC's president as well -- it was in keeping with Davis' long-established mode of personally controlling major political levers. 
All of that occurred, however, before California was plunged into the ""energy crisis,"" an infuriatingly complex amalgam of politics, economics, power supply and distribution, and such uncontrollable factors as the weather. 
When the first strains were felt 1 1/2 years ago, Davis and Lynch reacted, as one might expect, in tandem and, as later experience proved, poorly. They refused, in effect, to intercede with some steps -- such as long-term, low-price supply contracts and perhaps small rate increases -- that would have prevented the situation from deteriorating into a crisis. 
Last January, when the financial plight of the privately owned utilities brought the threat of major power blackouts, Davis and Lynch were forced to act. But within a couple of months, the previously inseparable partners began cleaving apart, at least publicly. 
At Lynch's behest, the PUC enacted a stiff rate increase while Davis claimed that she and the PUC had acted on their own, without his knowledge. It was widely seen at the time as a ploy, one that would bring about a rate boost that every authority knew was necessary, without forcing Davis to publicly change position. 
Since then, the two have continued to act in seemingly divergent ways. The PUC stepped into the political stalemate over Southern California Edison, for example, working up a secret deal that apparently will protect the utility from bankruptcy without having to win legislative approval. And the PUC has opposed the authority sought by the Davis administration to finance bonds that would pay for past and future state power purchases. 
Administration officials are publicly critical of Lynch and the PUC and circulate stories that Davis considers her to be an impediment. One version had Davis dumping her as president of the PUC in favor of a friendlier member. And PUC officials insist that Lynch is just acting to preserve the historic independence of the agency, first created nearly a century ago as a bulwark against the out-of-control Southern Pacific railroad. 
A lengthy article in Monday's Los Angeles Times traced the history of the Davis-Lynch relationship and, in effect, endorsed the conventional wisdom that the two erstwhile political allies had grown apart under the strain of the energy crisis. 
That may be true, but the intensity with which that interpretation of events is being peddled makes one suspicious that it's just another ploy aimed at protecting the governor's backside from the fallout of his less-than-deft handling of the energy situation. Polls indicate that it's the primary reason why his public approval rating has dropped dramatically this year, thus making his re-election next year less than certain. 
By doing the deal on Edison -- supposedly without Davis' knowledge -- Lynch saved the governor from a huge embarrassment. He had gone to the mat for the utility but was rebuffed by a Legislature dominated by his own party. He had called a special legislative session on Edison but had been told that he would lose again. 
Holding up approval of the administration's bond-power contract scheme is often cited as the most powerful evidence of a schism between Davis and Lynch, but she may be doing the governor a big favor in that arena as well. The contracts signed by the administration are much too expensive and, if implemented, will cost ratepayers billions of extra dollars over the next decade. Davis needs to dump them, but if he acts directly, he'll have to admit that he made a mistake. If the PUC continues to hold up the necessary authority, he can use that as a lever to force suppliers into whittling down prices, or even abandoning the contracts altogether -- without having to take responsibility for reneging. 
Maybe Davis and Lynch are feuding, but it could all just be a charade to fool the public and protect the governor."

> Calpine Benefiting From California Energy Crisis, Official Says
> By Daniel Taub
>
>
> San Jose, California, Aug. 28 (Bloomberg) -- Calpine Corp., a California
> power producer, has benefited from the state's energy crisis by locking in
> ``very favorable margins'' on long-term electricity sales, Senior Vice
> President James Macias said.
>
> About 90 percent of the electricity Calpine is generating this year is
being
> sold under long-term agreements to the state, Macias said on a conference
> call with analysts. A year ago, about 30 percent of Calpine's power was
> under contract, he said.
>
> Calpine, one of the largest U.S. power-plant builders, has been buying
> natural-gas fields to supply its power plants, spending about $1.9 billion
> from March last year to July to boost gas reserves to 1.5 trillion cubic
> feet. It also has bought gas in futures markets to help fix margins on
> electricity sales, Macias said.
>
> ``The California crisis, while not desired, has been a tremendous
> opportunity,'' Macias said. ``Calpine may be the only player emerging from
> the crisis with no overhang issues. We are emerging stronger than ever.''
>
> The long-term contracts have an average ``spark spread,'' or the
difference
> between revenue and the cost of fuel to generate the electricity, of
$26.50
> a megawatt-hour, Macias said. One megawatt-hour is enough energy to light
> 750 typical California homes for an hour.
>
> California has $43 billion in long-term energy contracts with Calpine and
> other generators. The state's Department of Water Resources began buying
> power on behalf of its three investor-owned utilities in January after the
> two largest, owned by PG&E Corp. and Edison International, became
insolvent
> buying power for more than they were allowed to charge customers.
>
> San Jose, California-based Calpine expects $16 billion in revenue over the
> next 20 years from contracts with the department, PG&E, the city of San
> Francisco, the Sacramento Municipal Utility District and other agencies.
> Most of the contracts are for 10 years or less.
>
> PG&E Payment
>
> Calpine is owed $267 million by PG&E's Pacific Gas & Electric, the state's
> largest utility, which filed for bankruptcy protection in April after
> accruing $9 billion in power-buying losses. Calpine expects to be paid
with
> interest after Pacific Gas submits its reorganization plan later this
year,
> Lisa Bodensteiner, Calpine's general counsel, said on the call.
>
> Calpine isn't owed money by Edison's Southern California Edison, which is
> negotiating a rescue plan with state lawmakers to keep California's No. 2
> utility out of bankruptcy, Macias said.
>
> Shares of Calpine fell 45 cents to $33.25. They have dropped 26 percent
this
> year.

"Molly set up the following tickets to capture our CGAS storage transactions.  
This is how it will work,

Deal #  Comment
268093  CES Exchange Buy - use when storage injections are less than the 
proxy volume
268090  CES Exchange Sell - use when storage injections are greater than the 
proxy volume
268094  CES Sell - this is the proxy storage injection ticket.  The volume 
should not change.


The daily proxy volume for the month of May is 35,133.  When we inject 
35,133, the transport we use to fill storage will be the supply for deal 
268094.  When we overinject like we did for the 1st - 4th, 35,133 of the 
transport will be matched with deal 268094 and the balance of the transport 
will be matched against deal 268090.  When we underinject, we will use deal 
268093 as the supply for deal 268094.

This may seem a little confusing.  Please call me if you still have questions.

"Just wanted to say hello.  I hadn't heard from you lately and wondered how 
things were going.  Have you moved out of the hotel yet?  I know how 
depressing it can be going home to a hotel room every night.  Even though the 
hotel where I lived for the first three months I was in Jakarta was very 
nice, it was still just a hotel room.  I was so glad to get out of there into 
an apartment - major quality of life improvement.

We've been just busy enough for me this month: Austin for a couple of days on 
Presidents' Day weekend, a Rockets game last Friday, and we're off to the 
Diverse Works annual gala on Saturday.   Ted wants to leave town to do 
something - anything - next weekend but I'm trying to talk him out of it 
since we're taking that week-long cruise starting the following Saturday.  
Since my arguments carry no weight, I'm just lucky that air fares are 
surprisingly high right now - $1000 rt to Ft. Lauderdale is even too high for 
Ted.

Ted's brother is working on a  project here in town so we had him over the 
other night for dinner.  Ted had planned - can you guess - tuna steaks, 
having conveniently forgotten that his brother is allergic to fish.  How do 
you just forget something like that?  Luckily they went to the gym ahead of 
time and Ted mentioned what was on the menu so they stopped at the store and 
bought his brother a steak on the way home.

That nice January bump in Enron's stock price is ancient history now - pretty 
much the whole thing has been given back.  I'm still going to buy a new car - 
looks like an Audi A6 - but just one.

Hope you are doing well!

Mike Day believes that SCE might agree to a new Stipulation in which they commit to pay our claim if their new deal and their pending Advice Letter are approved by the CPUC.  I have scheduled a call for tomorrow at 12:30 CST to discuss the terms we would like to see in the Stipulation (e.g., drop approval of the Advice Letter as a condition, payment within 10 days after CPUC approval, agreement on the number set forth in our response to their Data Request, agreement to apply accrued negative CTC credits to current T&D charges, to name a few).   On the other hand a delay in this proceeding is probably in our interest, in view of the SCE Counterclaim.  Going this route would probably be in lieu of some of the other alternatives we discussed, so I believe we will need to get senior management't approval to any agreement."

Guys,

Here is what I took away from our meeting:

1). Research will continue working on custom reporting off of EnronOnline

2). Research will continue working on market analysis off of EnronOnline data

3). Research will a contribute a resource to the Trading Algorithm effort, 
presumably one at this point in time. I would prefer it to be Vasant but I am 
flexible.The Trading Algorithm group will be run by the EnronOnline team with 
its product reviewed by Research. It is my belief that projects like this 
require a firm commercial hand in their infancy to make sure they stay on the 
right track.

If this presents a problem for anyone please let me know so that we can

Subject:	California Deal With SCE Is On Shaky Ground
CALIFORNIA DEAL TO BUY SCE HEADED FOR TROUBLE IN LEGISLATURE, CPUC

_______________________________________________

Date: April 18, 2001 - 

A source with California State Senator Debra Bowen's (D) office says Gov. 
Gray Davis' (D) tentative agreement to buy Southern California Edison's (SCE) 
transmission assets will face tough scrutiny from suspicious lawmakers who do 
not believe it is in the best interest of ratepayers. State regulators are 
also expressing concern about the deal and consumer advocates are predicting 
its demise.

""There are two alternatives,"" says the Bowen source. ""Lawmakers will either 
fashion a better deal or allow SCE to work out their problems in bankruptcy 
court."" 

Bowen is the chair of the Senate Energy, Utilities and Communications 
Committee.

The deal calls for SCE to sell its transmission assets to the state 
Department of Water Resources (DWR) for 2.3 times its book value or $2.76 
billion. The agreement also calls for the California Public Utilities 
Commission (PUC) to establish a rate plan so that $3.5 billion of debt could 
be recovered by SCE for its power purchases before the state began buying 
electricity in January. 

""This is the single most important cash flow provision of the memorandum of 
understanding,"" says a source with the state Office of Ratepayer Advocate 
(ORA). ""SCE will collect all of the costs they have incurred."" ORA had argued 
against bailing SCE out of debt saying its parent company had ample funds.

In return for the premium paid in excess of the value of its transmission 
assets, SCE has agreed to sell the output of its generating plants at 
cost-based rates.

""Because of the premium, cost-based rates should be lower,"" says the ORA 
source.

""The senator is very skeptical,"" says the Bowen source. ""The deal is a great 
benefit for generators and utilities but little, if any, benefit for 
ratepayers.""

The source says there is also concern with the SCE deal because it will only 
involve about a third of the 32,000 miles of transmission lines in the state.

""If you buy a third of a bridge don't you wind up getting wet"" asks the Bowen 
source. 

Davis has expressed optimism that the state will eventually obtain all of the 
state's utility transmission lines. Pacific Gas & Electric's (PG&E) 
bankruptcy filing has complicated the governor's plan, but Davis says the 
state can now obtain the assets through the courts. However, the state must 
now compete with private companies intent on the same thing. Negotiations 
between the state and San Diego Gas & Electric are continuing.

The Bowen source says provisions in the deal which fashion a way for 
generators to collect all they are owed by SCE is also of concern to 
lawmakers.

""The state's position was that the rates charged by generators were unjust 
and unreasonable,"" says the source. ""If you now pay the generators you have, 
at the very least, a public relations problem.""

The source says there may also be a court fight over the issue.

""The creditors dealing with PG&E in bankruptcy court would probably want the 
same treatment,"" says the source. ""This creates an intriguing whipsaw effect.""

A bill outlining the terms of the agreement between the state must be 
introduced before official consideration begins in the legislature. 

A source with UCAN says a bill based on the present agreement will never be 
passed.

""If it survives, it will be modified,"" says the source.

I am writing a management report on weather risk management. The story
will discuss different weather risk management tools used by power
marketers in the energy industry. It also looks at weather prediction
and analysis services available to energy traders.

I am looking for a list and description of the weather risk management
products, and how each can benefit an energy trader. I would also like
to know what  traders' reactions to significant weather are. And where
can I find a list of popular weather instruments with descriptions?

I appreciate any help you can give me. I would like to set up a chat
with you this week if you have the time, or simply email me your input.
Thanks in advance!

Gil,
I received my copy of the instructions to Morgan Stanley and the letter to 
the transfer agent.
I have faxed a copy to Frank Moy at Morgan Stanley who has not received the 
original,as yet.
I have requested his verification that the account is open and an anticipated 
timing for the transfer agent.

Have instructions been provided with the account opening authorizing John 
Greene to trade for Enron Communications Investments Corp?
Has Donna been provided with the necessary internal releases for the sale?
Are we anticipating only selling 2,392,058 in the near term since that is the 
only piece being registered in street-name?
John Greene will be provided with  instructions requesting him to sell and 
acceptable pricing guidelines.
 
Thanks Sheila

I was contacted by Petronas who requested a meeting
with Enron on risk  management. I have met with them
a few  years ago and they want to discuss with us 
their progress implementing risk management practices.

I shall arrange the meeting and get RAC involved.
Would you like to meet them for a short courtesy meeting 
(5 - 10  minutes)?

Unfortunately, they gave us no choice as far as the timing is concerned
(given a very tight schedule). They want to visit on Thursday, Feb.  8,
at 10 a.m. I shall take them out to lunch after the meeting.

Stacy White informed me this morning there is discussions on moving all of 
the Power Hedges from the accrual book (approx $100 million loss) into the 
MTM books.  Is this true?

Do I need to be in the loop?

FYI - We successfully bought out of the 2001 supply commitment to OPPD at our 
mark ($4.7 million).  This leaves us with 3 customer deals that I would like 
to set aside as prudency C for East Power (not West Power or gas) for 
calender year 2001.   The 3 deals are MJMUC, VEPCO, and JEA.

Subject: PI Installation Report


I totally support having a separate marketing and trading team in Ontario to 
focus on the opening of that market.  However, with respect to creating a 
redundant physical system operation/real-time unit monitoring/dispatch 
function in Ontario, it simply does not make economic or logistical sense.  
With the integration of the  6 peaker plants into our operation and the 
associated IT support, control area operations, plant operations, hourly 
trading, and real-time monitoring system here in Houston, we could provide 
all the necessary tools and support personnel necessary to perform this 
function from Houston.   All the critical trading information would obviously 
be available to the Ontario office, yet they would not have to be burdened by 
the additional overhead to build a stand alone physical operation.

From my standpoint, it just doesn't make sense to re-create the physical 
capabilities the Houston office has developed over the past two years.  The 
Ontario guys are doing a great job and I like their aggressive attitude, 
however, rationale business decisions should still prevail.

Your thoughts?

Attached is the data you requested today.   The schematic detail requested 
can be found in the email attachment at the bottom of this email.  Please 
also contact Ed Baughman on the TIE proposal for dispatching, scheduling and 
trading services that was recently done to leverage of the existing Genco 
facilities and staff.

On the dedicated ring downs all work was co-ordinated by Darren Adamik 
(713-853-4764) if you require additional details.

Generally it will take 4 staff for a 24 hour operation plus one vacation/sick 
relief.  Depending on the complexity of the operation you will have to 
determine the level of industry expertise.  A good plan would be to hire a 
senior lead utility type and then bring on junior staff.  The quality and 
quantity of staff will likely be based on the value at risk and the 
complexity of dispatching these units. 

If you consider the operation critical a diesel and UPS will be required.

Plasma displays run $10,000 to $15,000 per display plus any switching/av 
equipment.

We have a PI consultant on contract that could be available for your PI 
project - typically $ 150.00 per hour plus travel and expenses.

The above assumes that no special hardware/software is required from The IMO 
to dispatch these units.

Stop the blame; stop the political rhetoric.
If there's evidence that manipulation has occured, produce it--the 
investigations have been going on for a year.  Stop the McCarthyist tactics.
Californians want a real, comprehensive solution that is bi-partisan
More supply
Less demand
No state takeovers; state out of procurement now.
A real energy market place (competition and choice)
Creditworthy utilities (prices that reflect the true cost of power)

Subject: MarketPoint License Agreement


John/Vince:

I really enjoyed the meeting the other day with you and a broad cross
section of your people.  Thank you very much for setting it up, and thank
you for giving me the opportunity to speak with your people.

As I mentioned to John, I am sending you the license paperwork for
MarketPoint.  I have attached our standard license agreement for your
consideration.  As I mentioned, the license agreement covers the entire
bundled product, which includes

? North American gas, short and long term
? North American electricity, short and long term
? World gas
? Western European gas
? World oil

We are just finishing porting the world oil, world gas, and western Europea=
n
gas models over from our old (now obsolete) software system into
MarketPoint, so they will not be fully tested and complete for a couple of
months.  However, the gas and electricity models for North America are
presently complete and tested.  That should allow us to give you an
attractive price before the full worldwide toolkit is available throughout
your worldwide business.

As I understood it, you will want the gas modeling capability first and wil=
l
want to defer decisions on electric or other capability.  As I mentioned at
the meeting, we are prepared to offer that for approximately=20
 the fully
bundled price.  As you read the license agreement, you will see that the
software licenses for $100,000 annually, the gas data for $5,000, and the
electric data for $10,000.  MarketPoint will agree to license you the gas
model plus the data for=20
 the software license plus the data license for a
total of $55,000 annually.  This is just under=20
 the fully bundled price.  I
think that is consistent with the discussions at our meeting, and from
MarketPoint=01,s perspective would provide a great basis to move forward
together with Enron.  If or when Enron ever desires to =01&scale up=018 to =
another
model or model(s) from the MarketPoint portfolio, we will simply scale you
up to the entire license agreement.  This will allow you to decouple the ga=
s
decision from any other decisions you might make.  (I will be glad to put
this additional pricing provision into the agreement if you decide to move
forward.)

I felt I was able to communicate the philosophy, scope, and operation of ou=
r
approach during the meeting and to deliver you much of the information you
might need to evaluate whether MarketPoint meets your needs.  I thought you
were able to see the depth and sophistication of the product yet at the sam=
e
time its simplicity and effectiveness.  I thought you were able to see the
benefits of the MarketPoint dimension of economic equilibrium as a
complement and supplement to other approaches you will assuredly use.  I
would be interested in your impressions and those of your colleagues.  I
look forward to your response and to moving ahead together.  We view you as
a very important prospective customer and client and will work with you to
earn and secure your business.

If you decide to license MarketPoint, we can arrange to transfer and mount
MarketPoint and the short term NARG model (which is the model we suggest yo=
u
begin with) and travel to Houston to deliver our 1=20
 day training seminar.
Our clients are usually very fluent after that 1=20
 day training seminar.
Thereafter, we would want you to work with the short term NARG model for a
few weeks while you get up to speed, very fluent, and very comfortable
before you take delivery of the longer term version of NARG several weeks
later.

Thanks again, and all the best.  If there is some item from the meeting tha=
t
I might have forgotten to send, please remind me.  My notes don't show
anything, but I was speaking a lot rather than writing notes during the
meeting and might have overlooked something someone wanted.

"Matt, 

Each month, prior to bidweek, I pull up a monthly range in Path Manager to get a feel of how many of our swing customers operated in a prior month (or a month in a prior year).  I have never had problem with this before, and I have done this task every month since Unify was put into production.  When the problem occurred this month, I was attempting to view Apr 1-30, 2000 on Houston Pipe Line, with HPL as the shipper.  This information is very important for my bidweek preparation.  So, I need to continue perfomorming this operation each month.  If needed, I can wait until 5 pm top view the range.

Darren,
Do you know if you were running pulling up the Path Manager for a date range around 10:51?  How do you normally pull up the Path Manager?  Please let me know as we're attempting to find out what caused this problem and if we should restrict access on the date range functionality.  If you were only pulling it for a day, that would be okay.

Subject: What happened: tempdb xact log


Brian, 
 
At 11:20am this morning, a stored procedure (source_dest_list_range_sp, Line #172) being run by Daren Farmer caused the tempdb transaction log on unifygasp to fill up.  This procedure is run routinely by many other users on a daily basis without incident.  At the time of the failure, this stored procedure had been running since 10:51am, or roughly 30 minutes.  I was notified via automatic page at 11:24am; the page indicating that there was 200MB free.  I immediately checked tempdb, which was by full by this time.  Three attempts to clear the transaction log prior to 11:30am finally resulted in a cleared transaction log.
 
Kishore noiced shortly thereafter that there was a problem in the way that Sybase was accounting for its free space, a condition which may have been crucial to the failure since nearly 5GB of space was apparently unavailable to the transaction log.  A reboot of unifyprod2 at 1:40pm cleared this condition.

"Chris,  My comments are as follows:

 1.    The term (Article 4) was revised from the previous draft (month to 
month) to now being a definitive term with no evergreen provision.  Is this   
acceptable commerically?  Should we add an evergreen provision on to the end 
of the current definitive term?

 2.  Section  9.9 - Doesn't give a time frame for this approval process.  
Hattiesburg has no obligations under this agreement until this approval 
occurs.   What if it doesn't occur for 3 years?  Need either (i) ability to 
walk away from this agreement if not done by date certain, or (ii) assurances 
from   Hattiesburg that this is a short process or has already been 
accomplished.

 3.  Definition 1.2 in the GTC of ""day"".  Does this day match the gas day for 
the interstate pipelines?  If not will this cause problems in scheduling. 

 4.  General Comment:  Does this interruptible agreement provide the level of 
service that this power plant will commercially   require?  Hattiesburg can 
interrupt service at any time at  its discretion and furthermore, never 
provide service under this   agreement by indicating to Caledonia that its 
storage capacity is full with other storage committments.  Does this work?

Title: The Merger and Acquisition Dilemma
Author: North American Power Team
E-Mail Category: Conference Call, Multimedia
Product Line: North American Electric Power

URL: http://www.cera.com/client/nap/media.cfm

There is a merger and acquisition dilemma facing the power industry today.
The fact that no clear-cut winning strategy has emerged makes the dilemma
more difficult to resolve. In a December 1 CERA North American Power client
conference call and web presentation, Paul Parshley, CERA Director,
discusses:

*  The long term strategy and short term returns of M&A: What does it mean
for multi-service providers, super-regional provides and the global power
and energy companies?

*  The M&A wave continues: Is it better to be near the front of the pack and
embark on an unproven and risky strategic option and hope for the best, or
to wait until strategic options are better understood and run the risk of
missing the best opportunities?

*  Stock prices of recently merged or acquired companies: Is Warren Buffet
right about the power industry?

"Thanks for your note.  In reply:

1.  We will change United Kingdom to England in the governing law section.

2.  and 3.  We did switch to the English law form and our form didn't provide 
for using securities as collateral.  As you point out, it is likely that SR 
will always be in the money and the CSA provides for an unlimited Threshold 
for SR at all times so that it will never be providing collateral under that 
document.   There are certainly other changes that could be made to the 
document with that in mind but in the interest of time we didn't make much of 
an effort on that score - our theory was that you wouldn't mind too much 
since you would never have to post anything under this document.

Please let me know if you have any other questions or comments.

Kingdom.""   I have never seen this formulation and think it should say
""England,"" as I believe there are in fact multiple legal systems (e.g.,
Scottish) within the U.K.

2.  I am not sure why all collateral except LCs was deleted.  Was this
agreed by EFR?  If so, OK.  If not, could the CSA provide for other
collateral as Gordon requested.  It is unusual for SR entities to use LCs
in non-reinsurance situations and would probably cost them less to post
Treasuries.  Here it is of course unlikely that EFR will have to post
anything, since EFR will always be in the money to some extent.

3. Did you switch to the English law form of CSA?

Subject: Comments on ACR re SCE's MOU



About ten days ago, I sent the attached E-mail containing an Assigned
Cmmr.'s Ruling pertaining to the SCE MOU. The  ACR set forth a ""model"" for
determining revenue requirements for SCE's retained generation. On Friday,
SCE, as directed, filed comments on the Ruling.  Comments from other parties
are due this Friday, the 11th.

Of primary importance is that SCE used its comments to promote the
methodology for recovery of retained generation costs it had set forth in
Advice 1534-E-A (forwarded  to you last week).  This method provides for an
annual rate true-up mechanism and trigger mechanism.  Such mechanisms allow
for rate increases (or decreases) with the filing of an advice letter.

If we are opposed to such trigger / true-up mechanisms  we need to submit
comments on Friday and/or  a protest of the Advice Filing (also due on the
11th).

Dear Professor Kaminski

    I , Masayuki Fujita was the only Japanese attendee of the Energy 
Derivatives seminar
in Houston last December and a member of Japanese consultation firm: 
Mitsubishi Research
Institute, Inc. I would be very honored if you can meet with me 17 or 18 
April after
attending Energy Trading Summit in 12th-14th. As you know, Japanese 
electricity trading is
on the way of deregulation beneficial to the consumers from a long stage of 
the nine major
companies' regional monopoly. We are giving a hand to help the Ministry and 
industry to
find the right course of them. I and my colleague Yamada, who will attend Risk
Publications Monte Calro seminar in Four Seasons Hotel, would like to visit 
you and your
company for studying the sophisticated risk management at Enron. In return, 
we may give
you the information about recent institutional progress and major electricity 
companies
response in Japan.

    We are now personally translating your book ""Managing Energy Price Risk"" 
second
edition and wondering if you have not given the right to publish in Japanese 
and nay give
us the chance to help you introduce modern technology to manage energy risk 
in the
Japanese energy industry.

    I do not hope Japanese English power prevent me to pass my sincerity to 
you and I can
visit you soon.

Thanks for the call.  I'll be in Thursday all day after 10:00 (dentist in the

"Hi Katie,  Yes I am back in town.  Sorry I wasn't able to return your email 
yesterday.  It has just been crazy around here and I am leaving for San 
Antonio tommorrow and will be out the rest of the week for the Enron Legal 
Conference.  It is going to be at La Cantera on the northwest side of SA.  
The place sounds pretty relaxing, so it should be fun.  Back in Houston 
Friday late.  

Yea Denver was nice.  Slight delay in the flight, but not due to weather.  
Just the usual airline misadventures.  It was snowing pretty hard when I 
arrived.  Kinda nice to be around some actual cold weather for a change.  
Worked all day Friday and stayed with some friends Sat. night.    Wish I had 
time to go up to the mountains for skiing.  So your not big on skiing huh?  
The first time I went I hated it, but as you get better it really becomes a 
lot of fun.  Last time I went (last March) I tried snowboarding.  It was a 
lot of work to learn a new snow sport.  It was cool after I got the hang of 
it, except for dislocating my shoulder.  Ouch! 

Sounds like ya'll had a good time at Northgate.  I hate it when friends take 
you out and get you drunk.  That seems to happen to me occasionally.  OK more 
than occasionally.  

This time change does make for a rough week.  I didn't wake up until 8:00 am 
for work on Monday.  Just a little later for work than usual. 

Coming into Houston anytime soon?  If you get a chance, I'd really like to 
take you to dinner sometime.  Take care.  Bye!

George-

In this afternoon's meeting with Producer Services, Jill mentioned that the 
referenced well had been reperfed (meaning they shot more holes in the well 
piping allowing more gas to flow out of the well) and was now producing 
approximately 800/day.  Per Jill, the MDQ on this well is 3000/day.  You may 
want to look at getting this nom revised for the rest of the month.

Mary-  could you get Heidi or Lisa to check the transport rate we currently

Dear Vasant,

I am currently working with Bryan Seyfried and the Credit Markets/Trading 
group
in London, and am in the process of designing and building a website as an
information portal.

I am in possession of a paper that you co-authored entitled ""Actively Managing
Credit Risk"", which was published in Risk Publications.

Bryan has asked Bijoya (who is interning here during her X-mas holiday from 
the
LSE) to update this paper and generate a new White Paper about the current 
state
of the credit market and the developments we are pursuing and creating. This
will be used on our website and be published later in time.

Could you please - if you have the time - contact and maybe work with Bijoya 
to
draft this White Paper? Bryan is in Houston today and may be able to give a
better idea of what he is exactly looking for ... Otherwise, he will be in
London again next week.

I thank you in advance, and hope that we can pull something together in the 
next
few weeks.

Please contact me at any time!

Regards from London

Katja

Some comments on your comments:

Section II: I don't like the title ""Commercial Development Manager"" but 
rather ""Risk Manager"" 
Response:         The title Commercial Development Manager comes from the MEH 
Operating Agreement.  We can amend the LLC Agreement  if necessary, but it 
seems burdensome since the title is only a formality.  However, as currently 
written, the Commercial Development Manager is the person responsible for 
managing the daily business, i.e. similar to a desk director.  In order to 
maintain control of this position, it can only be filled by an Enron nominee 
and will report directly to the MEH General Manager, Laura Luce of Enron.

Section VII: Majority of the wording came initially from attorneys, I would 
recommend confirming that.
Response:          I will run this by the attorneys.  However, from a 
technical perspective, Section VII refers to employees of MEH.  No one in the 
Chicago office is an employee of MEH, but rather we all remained employees of 
our respective organizations.  I will ask the attorneys if we need to limit 
all Chicago based employees, both of Enron North America and Peoples Energy 
Resources.

Section VIII: Who is the General Manager of MEH?
Response:          As mentioned above, Laura Luce, Vice President of Enron 
North America
  Is Enron North America Corp. a legal entity?
Response:          Yes, Enron North America Corp. replaced Enron Capital 
Trade and Resources as the Wholesale business of Enron Corp.  Unless you know 
something different, I believe that to be a true statement.

Let me know if any of my responses don't make sense or you still have any 
questions.  I am still going to try to get this out by 10:00 or so.

Subject: Revised RM Policy

Vlady - As we discussed, I am attaching my revisions to your initial draft.  
They are mainly cosmetic attempts to make the RM Policy terms consistent with 
the MEH Operating Agreement and separate MEH from any behind the scenes 
reporting or controls that ENA chooses to place on Richard/MEH.  Let me know 
if you have any concerns about my edits.  I would like to send this to 
Peoples end of day today.  I will follow up with Structuring to find a body 
to model the underlying asset position.  

Thanks - Gregg

Rob is fine... we had a little tiff and didn't talk for a week. He went to
the LDC forum in Boston. We made up over e-mail today... or at least
exchanged apologies. I'm not sure when I'll see him again. Gloria is
visiting me next weekend... girls night out. The following weekend Cindy is
visiting me. The weekend after that I'll be in Houston for TCO shipper
meeting. It has been two weeks since I've seen him. We have a great time
when we are together, it just hasn't been very often latetly.

OK this is metered production on CNG.

Gloria will let us know which CNG contract to path this deal with.
The meter numbers are 50089201, 5105901, and 5118301 and this is CES 
production.

After Gloria lets us know which contract(s) to use, Angie will path this deal

The only issue I have with the testimony is the statement that the units are 
""extremely quiet"".  At this point FCE will only guaranty 60dba, which some 
folks might not consider to be extremely quiet depending on how close a 
facility is to their house.  You may have determined that the noise level 
will be some number less than 60 dba so that the guaranty level does not 
reflect the expected noise level.

Steve:  I'm going to give you a call.  Few things:
Got your message.  As you'll see from the document, I likely spent too much 
time over the weekend on the ""what's in it for consumers"" messages.  Since it 
was one of the the ""to do"" items, I figured that it should get some emphasis, 
but sounds like that may not be the case.
I've proposed a template for how to provide feedback on the Gov's specific 
proposals, using direct investment in power plants by the state as the 
illustrative example.  Let me know if you think it works.  I have ideas on 
each, but thought it better to await feedback from the commercial folks 
before filling out our comments in each area.
I'm finishing up a bit more detailed proposal for how the Gov might use 
""energy gurus"" to help on the portfolio/procurment issues, and am also 
offering additional detail on the need for a ""rate summit.""
Got messages in to Schroeder re: Nordpool--expect to hear back from him today 
at some point and I can drop that info into the document soon as I get it.
Will talk to EES at 10 AM CST to discuss their proposals.  If you'd like to 
join that call, let me know and I'll forward along the call-in number, which 
I think you may already have in your email.
Have received a few comments from ENA that I'll incorporate.

Best,

"Kim,
 I have reviewed your markup of the redlined contract I forwarded to you last 
Wednesday.  Since you confirmed that we were merely putting into place a 
three month contract, we should be able to resolve the issues rather 
quickly.  If we were working on the Master, I would agree that we are a long 
way apart.  Let me respond to the changes you put in your last redline.

 1. Delete the definition of ""Credit Support Provider"".
 2. Add definition as follows:  The term ""Guarantor"" means, as to Seller, 
Seller's ultimate parent, Enron Corp.
 3. Restore the definition of Material Adverse Change to the language as 
provided in my redline to you.  It is the position of our Credit Department 
that a rating of BBB- is considered investment grade and as such that is the 
benchmark below which a material adverse change would be triggered.  Enron 
Corp. is currently rates as BBB.
 4. The changes that you made in 2.1.1, 2.1.2, and 2.2.1 are okay.  The 
change that was made to 2.2.2. should be deleted.
 5. The change that was made to 2.3.1 and 2.4.1 is okay. 
 6. The changes that were made in 9.1 should be removed because the sale and 
purchase quantity is based on the DCQ.   Note that all settlements under the 
Contract are based on the DCQ and any variations between actual and DCQ is to 
be handled between the party and its transporter. 
 7. The change in 9.3 should be changed back to five (5) Days instead of 10 
Days.  5 days is the equivalent of 60 days deliveries, changing to 10 would 
mean 65 delivery days have elapsed before the Seller can notify Buyer of a 
payment default.
 8. The change in 10.2 of ""at or"" should be restored.  This is a 3 month 
deal.  Seller's position is that Buyer is responsible for any taxes at or 
after delivery.  Future Taxes are not applicable to a 3 month deal.
 9. All of the changes made to 12.2, 12.3 and 12.5 should be removed.  There 
is no partial force majeure, a party is either unable to perform because of 
the event or the party can perform.  Please explain how the loss of Buyer's 
market could be due to an event of Force Majeure and why the Buyer should not 
be required to find a new market during such period.  Force Majeure should 
only allow termination if the period extends for more than 180 Days and then 
it should only be a triggering event allowing the other party to terminate 
and collect a Termination Payment.
 10.   The change in 14 should be deleted.  There is no event which would 
allow early termination other than a Triggering Event.  
 11. Please explain the changes in 16.4.  Seller has provided all of the 
notice address information that will be put in the Contract.  No telephone 
number or other address will be added.
 12. All of the changes made to 17.1, 17.2, 17.3 and 17.4 should be deleted 
and the original language provided in my previous redline should be 
restored.  These are requirements set forth by Enron's credit requirement and 
are not subject to negotiation by me.  
 13. I have no problem with the changes proposed for 18.1, 18.2, 18.3 nor the 
addition of 18.4; however, I do not believe that either party would be able 
to locate qualified arbitrators who would agree to the shortened periods.  
Please reconsider.
 14. The changes made to the guaranty document appear to be acceptable and I 
would forward same to Enron Corp. for their consideration.

 Please review the Contract in light of the matters raised above and let me 
have your comments so that we can get this finalized as soon as possible.

Dan-

Attached is a redline document showing our counter to your redline proposal.
The majority of your changes were fine, from my perspective, with minor
tweaking (for example, timelines in arbitration).  The two primary items I
think we will need to discuss are (1) Taxes and (2) the definition of a
Material Adverse Change.  Please see my suggestions and then we can discuss.
As part of this discussion, could you please provide Enron North America
Corp's and Enron Corp's S&P debt ratings?

"At the last EEI meeting there was a strong interest in beefing up the 
collateral provisions of the EEI (what a great idea).  Bill McCoy at Morgan 
Stanley was asked to prepare the first draft, a copy of which I am forwarding 
to you for your review. Please review and let either Shari or I know if you 
have any comments or thoughts - while EEI's message does not indicate when 
comments are due ( I have a call into EEI but have not yet heard back), I 
have asked Shari to help coordinate all comments so we can get back in touch 
with EEI within the next week or so.  Thanks for your input.

"Calif Resells Surplus Power At A Loss In Second Quarter
 
LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The California agency buying power in lieu of the state's ailing utilities resold electricity in the spot market during the second quarter at an average price of $45 a megawatt-hour, the agency said Wednesday. 

The announcement by the California Department of Water Resources was an answer to critics who blasted the department this summer for having to resell surplus power for as little as $1 a megawatt-hour because it secured too much electricity under long-term contracts negotiated by the administration of Gov. Gray Davis, the department said. 

In a press release, the department's California Energy Resources Scheduling division, its power-marketing arm, said it resold 224,871 megawatt-hours, or 1.1% of its total purchases. That power generally was first bought on the spot market or through monthly or quarterly contracts, not the long-term contracts, the department said. 

Such sales are typical of any power-buying operation, as demand for electricity can vary in unpredictable ways, the department said. 

The DWR is responsible for buying all the power needed by the customers of the state's three main utilities beyond what the utilities generate themselves or have secured under their own long-term contracts - or about one-third of the total. 

According to the DWR, power secured under Davis' long-term contracts covers one-third to one-half of the electricity it must supply. Short-term deals, such as monthly or quarterly contracts, represent one-third of the portfolio. The rest is bought in the spot market. 

The state has put its average cost of power under the long-term contracts at 7.9 cents per kilowatt-hour for the first five years and 6.9 cents per kilowatt-hour for the next five years. 

Davis has taken heat for locking up too much electricity at high prices. Similarly, the Department of Water Resources has been criticized for amateurish purchasing practices. 

The DWR releases information on its power transactions quarterly to protect its negotiating position, the department said. 

The DWR buys power for customers of PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric, Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison and Sempra Energy (SRE) unit San Diego Gas & Electric. "

Calif. utilities risk imminent default, S&P warns
(UPDATE: Recasts, adds details, background. Adds byline)

By Jonathan Stempel

NEW YORK, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern =
California Edison are at grave risk of default and bankruptcy within =
weeks, and are likely to see their high credit ratings fall to low junk =
grades if they do not get regulatory help by Friday, credit rating agency =
Standard & Poor's said on Wednesday.

``S&P is prepared to take dramatic rating action,'' said Richard Cortright,=
 an S&P analyst, in a conference call. ``The ratings are expected to drop =
deeply into speculative grade to reflect the likelihood of imminent =
default.''

The agency assessed the situation as the California Public Utilities =
Commission prepared to meet Thursday to consider whether to allow Pacific =
G&E and Southern California Edison to pass on at least some of their =
skyrocketing wholesale electricity costs to consumers.

Shares of PG&E Corp.(NYSE:PCG - news), the parent of Pacific G&E, closed =
Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange at $20-15/16, down $1-7/16, or =
6.42 percent. Shares of Edison International (NYSE:EIX - news), the parent =
of Southern California Edison, closed at $17-7/8, down $1-1/8, or 5.92 =
percent.

The utilities operate under a rate freeze through March 2002, and are also =
unable to negotiate long-term supply contracts. These factors expose them =
to the vagaries of the volatile spot power market.

Wholesale power recently cost more than $1,400 per megawatt hour, a more =
than 40-fold increase over the $35 per megawatt hour rate last year.

California imposed the rate freeze as part of its deregulation of the =
utilities sector, which was intended to promote competition and consumer =
choice.

Among the options the commission has to remedy the situation are a hike in =
the utilities' price caps.

Even that, however, would constitute a ``band-aid on a bullet wound,'' =
said Ron Barone, who leads S&P's utility group and also participated in =
the conference call.

Californians have already been warned to cut back their energy use, and =
that they may be subject to rolling blackouts.

Cortright said unless the commission offers the utilities significant =
regulatory relief, Pacific G&E and Southern California Edison will be =
dependent on the capital markets for cash infusions, if any are available.

``There are bills that are coming due in January and February,'' he said. =
``We would be naive to think that the capital markets are going to open =
their doors to satisfy (their needs) in the current environment.''

``To be frank,'' he added, ``we are amazed that events have been permitted =
to reach anywhere near this critical stage. It truly is unfathomable. We =
really do need some emergency actions taken now.''

Pacific G&E last completed a big bond sale in October, selling $1.35 =
billion of bonds. Southern California Edison and its parent, Edison =
International, sold an equivalent amount in early November.

Both companies carry ``A-plus'' corporate credit ratings and ``single-A'' =
senior unsecured debt ratings. Pacific G&E's secured debt carries an =
``AA-minus'' rating. Those ratings are considered mid to high investment =
grades.

One trader said Southern California Edison's debt began on Tuesday being =
quoted by price, like junk bonds, instead of by the extra yield they offer =
relative to similar maturity U.S. Treasuries, like investment-grade bonds.

Its 5.875 percent notes maturing in September 2004 were quoted Wednesday =
at about 87 cents on the dollar, yielding about 11.3 percent to maturity. =
No price quotation was immediately available on Pacific G&E's debt.=20

"The policy is to delete all e-mails after 30 days, unless they are stored in 
a folder. E-mails stored in a folder are erased after one year. The policy 
has many benefits. First it clears up computer storage space.
The policy can  also results in signifigant cost savings in litigation where 
a Judge has required the wholesale production of  e-mails. Imagine if we were 
required to sift through and digest 12-24 months of e-mail traffic. This has 
happened to a number of companies in litigation  the US( who have 
subsequently changed their retention policies). Frankly, the Microsoft  
antitrust case opened a lot of eyes to the dangers of not having a policy. In 
that case, the discovery by the Dept of Justice produced some very damaging 
e-mails that were later used to effectively cross-examine Bill Gates and 
others. It is unbelievable  what some people will put in an e-mail that they 
would never dream of putting in a ""written""  document.
As for your comment about the subsequent retrieval of deleted e-mails, I (and 
Bob) have been told many times that a deleted e-mail cannot be retrieved. 
Please check with your source. I am happy to discuss any questions you have 
about the policy."

Subject: Meeting to Discuss 501D5A Status

Kay:

We really need to get on top of the situation with the 501D5A. I believe SW 
is now taking the position that the generator was delivered under the terms 
of the contract, and risk of loss resided with us at the time of the ""event"". 
I furthermore understand they are taking the position that if we want a 
replacement generator, that we need to execute a change order. Kind of makes 
you feel like you're getting squeezed...

At the end of the day, we've got $25 million in a CT without a generator. ENA 
will get saddled with these costs if we do not find a resolution either 
through a buyer or a settlement with SW.

I really hope we can focus on this in the next couple of days. FYI, both 
Chris Booth and Ron Tapscott have been drafted on this effort. 

Thanks,

Ben

regulations.  Two RRC regulatory reporting matters in which I have been 
involved are HPL's Gas Utility General Annual Report and tariffs.  I have 
concluded that the way in which these filings are accomplished, and 
particularly the information systems used in the processes, should be 
reviewed.  Mike Eiben and Bob Hall have also been involved in this process 
(although Bob came in only recently) and are much more familiar with the 
intricacies of the process and systems than I.  Rather than going into detail 
in this memo, I intend to set up a meeting soon for the addressees of this

Zimin, 
Happy new year! 
The financial trading group is looking at a potential candidate for a general 
financial trading position in Japan and was wondering if someone from your 
area wouldn't mind testing this candidates mathematical skills. She has a 
Masters in Stochastic Mathematics  and both a math/liberal arts undergrad. I 
feel it is important to test her grasp of the subjects she would have studied 
and know that someone from your area would be best suited in providing some 
feedback on this. 
The candidate's name is Yumi Imokawa. If you don't mind, could I please 
schedule a telephone interview for 20 minutes or so? The ideal time is Tokyo 
mornings (so for example, at 5:00 in the evening Houston time any day that 
you are available..I will just have the candidate call your point person 
directly.


Sincerely,
Darren

need to get the draft P.O. (with the legal revisions) to FCE by Friday.  At 
this point, I am mainly concerned about the business points and the status of 
the technical information.  If we are going to be substantially done by a 
week from Friday, we need to move that portion along faster.  If we get 
feedback on the business points by early tomorrow, I would like to get those 
comments into the draft P.O.  If not, then I want to send the P.O. (with the 
changes we have) to FCE so they can review it on the weekend.

"Dear Ernesto , 

Welcome to the pleasure of planning an event for your asshole friends.
This has been a long standing tradition that the person that gets sucked or suckered
into planning an outing for the group gets bitched at non stop until the event happens.
The next step is ""the event"" that will be the turning point of this bitching.
There are two outcomes,
1.	Everyone has a good time and you will bitch back and it will be lessened to good friendly humor
2.	Everyone is pissed b/c they drove 100 miles , they play bad and blame you for picking a bad place to
	play, they kill you and bury you in a sand trap on the number 12 hole , finish the round and never mention
	your name again.

All I have to say Ernie is good luck on everyone play GOLF well this Sunday.

Live the next few days to the fullest , they might be your last.

Long live Ernesto

Please read the message below (from Mark).  He asked about it, I looked it
up and got us a tee time.  If anybody wants to get a tee time somewhere
else, that is fine with me.  Just let me know so that I can cancel the tee
times in Kingwood.

With Richard playing and the boys from Austin playing, I think that Kingwood
is a happy medium.  We could try Brock park if that's what you guys want.
Who the hell lives by Brock?  I actually think that the drive to Kingwood is
better than the drive into 5th ward or whatever ward it is.

I don't mind making a drive to play in Austin or Beaumont or Katy.  It's
golf!!!!

"I have asked ENA's Compensation team within HR to conduct a compensation 
study for me for all positions from Manager level through Vice President.  
This analysis will include employees who are dedicated to ENA, EIM and EGM.

It had been the plan to complete our compensation analysis by focusing on the 
Manager level and above, following the market analysis for Senior Specialists 
and below that was completed by Yvonne Land.  I learned recently that Yvonne 
has left the Company and that she had not begun the analysis for Managers and 
above.

Todd Burke, who recently joined Enron, will be conducting the market survey 
and compensation analysis.  I met with Todd recently.  He has had wonderful 
experience with Towers Perin and Watson Wyatt, and I feel that we are 
fortunate to have him devoted to this project.  Please give sufficient 
thought and attention to requests from Todd.  The quality and timeliness of 
your responses will directly impact the quality and timeliness of the 
analysis that I will receive from Todd.  I think that you should each have a 
vested interest in the success of this project!

Todd also plans to resurvey market information for Senior Specialists and 
below so that his view of compensation will be complete and timely for all of 
Energy Operations.  Since we recently took action on compensation levels for 
key players at the Senior Specialist level and below, I would not anticipate 
further adjustments for those levels as a result of Todd's review.

You should receive a message from Todd in the next day or so in which he will 
detail steps in the compensation analysis and what your role will be.

Kay:

We have enclosed drafts of the following documents for review:

 1. $16,100,000 Promissory Note to be executed by the LLC
payable to ENA;
 2. Membership Certificate No. 1 (100% in the name of ENA);
 3. Membership Certificate No. 2 (20% in the name of ENA);
 4. Membership Certificate No. 3 (80% in the name of TEH).

We have not drafted the form of the promissory note to be executed by the
LLC payable to TEH, as we have no information on the proposed terms of that
note.

I understand that the back sides of the membership certificates require a
little extra handiwork to print, but hopefully the substance of the
certificates will come across.  If you would prefer that I fax over the
certificates, please let me know.  Thank you.

""Tim Gallen (E-mail)"" <tim@gallen.com>  cc:   Subject: SBX 9 (Elimination of 
Standby Charges) 


The Distributed Energy Resources industry won a major battle yesterday.  The 
California Senate Energy and Utilities Committee passed on a 7-0 bipartisan 
vote, Sen. Morrow's (and while her name wasn't on this bill, it was as much 
Sen. Alpert's) bill on eliminating any tariff that discriminates against 
DER.  SBX 9 was derived from the omnibus DER bill SBX 35 which is still alive 
and contains many important provisions fro removing additional barriers.  
Yesterday's vote represents a major win because even if the bill ultimately 
does not get enacted, a very important statement has been made by the 
committee.  I'm sure the CPUC will take notice in their proceedings.
 
The DER community owes much thanks to Sen.'s Morrow and Alpert, and the 
Utilities Committee Members and their staffs:
Sen. Bowen (Chair)
Sen. Alarcon
Sen. Battin
Sen. Dunn
Sen. Murray
Sen. Poochigian
Sen. Sher
Sen. Speier
Sen. Vasconcellos
Sen. Vincent
 
Also much thanks to everyone who worked incredibly hard and diligently on 
this effort.  From the business, consumer advocacy, environmental, 
government, manufacturing, and real estate communities.
 
Here are the highlights of yesterday's actions:
 
1. For IOU's- No discriminatory tariffs for new DER installed between May 1, 
2000 and June 1, 2003 if DER is in combined heat and power mode.  If you have 
a peaking unit with gen only, then you have until  July 1 2001, to get it 
installed.  
2. DER installed within the window gets the exemption until June 1, 2011.
3. The maximum capacity of the DER is 5 MW in aggregate per site.
4. The DER must have emissions levels of 9 PPM or better until the ARB 
established new guidelines and standards, expected late this year or early 
next year.
5. Customers with DER are still required to pay interconnection, public 
purpose charges, and obligations incurred under the Dept. of Water Resources 
energy purchases program.
6. The CPUC shall require the electrical corporations to include non-utility 
owned DER in its planning process.
7. The CPUC is required to establish a firewall so that in the event that the 
implementation of DER results in net costs to the system, those costs stay 
within the customer class.
8. The CPUC shall require the utilities to establish new rates for DER that 
are non-discriminatory and take into account the benefits as well as the 
costs.
9. Muni's are required to review their tariffs for barriers to entry and hold 
public meetings to solicit comment for recommended changes.
Now we have momentum, but there is still a tremendous amount of work to do on 
the Assembly side and with Governor's office.  We need the continued 
(increased) support of all of you as we move this forward.

Bill,
Info...in recent talks SCE ventured the opinion that based on thier alleged
experience it would take 6 or 8 months to get a new contract cycled thru the
CPUC for approval and implementation.  If this is true (which I doubt) it
could impact on the operational capability of our PDA which expires in 7
months.  Do you folks agree it could not happen quicker.  If need be, do you
know any strategy for getting thru that process quicker?

Per conv. a minute ago with Marcus, Christi Nicolay in the Regulatory Group

I just set up all the deal tickets for the CGAS New Power storage contract 
for Nov-Mar.  We believe our agency relationship with New Power will end 
effective March 31, 2001.  The deal numbers are on the attached worksheet.  

I entered the following deals at a zero commodity
470563  Buy exchange
470582  Sell Cpr Storage

470587 Buy CPR Storage
470568 Sell exchange


I added about 7500 dth to deal 456379 for November and I extended it through 
March 31.  

I'm kinda sleepy so I probably made a few mistakes.

Joe and Brian: my favorite case may require that I work a full day on
Friday 
and leave with Brian friday afternoon. If I need to do that, I would
greatly 
appreciate it if Joe would agree to stop by the golf cart place to pick
up 
the new batteries. Please let me know if this is agreeable joe. e.

Subject: Tenaska IV 10/00

We have actuals.  The larger of the two volumes is 1,395,000, which is 
45,000/day, so the demand rate in deal 514353 is fine.  I am having a 
problem, though, with the way it is coming to settlements.  It is showing up 
with a Jan 2003 delivery date.  I think the demand fee needs to be on 10/1 
only.  Right now, it is on a line with a date of 10/1/00 to 12/31/36.   I 
think this is confusing the system some how.  Also, we still need the 
purchase deal for Tenaska IV.  It should be for a demand fee of $2,571,135.73 
booked to the Cleburne desk.  We actually owe $1,798,389.73, but I need to 
net the Tenaska IV sales with the purchase to clear those receivables.  James 
is calling me every day asking for an update.  Do you know when we will be 
able to get this in the system?  I have attached my spreadsheet so you can 
see the numbers.

Please find attached the Name Change/Merger Notification Report for January.  
To launch the report, double click on the attachment and select Enable Macros 
and Read Only.
Please note that:
 ERMS short names will be changed in GCP and ERMS each Friday at 10am Central 
Time, and 
 Inactivations will be made on Feb 1

We have made a few changes to our Name Change/Merger Notification Report - it 
now has a new look and a couple of features we hope will assist you.  For 
more information, please click below:


Each month now has two sheets, a summary sheet (eg Jan 01 Changes) and a 
detailed sheet (eg Jan 01).
Click below for more information:

The summary sheet can be used to view all changes after a certain date.  If 
you're aware of all changes up to, say, January 15th enter 01/16/2001 in cell 
C6 of the Summary Sheet and click the Sort button in cell H6.  All changes 
made to the report on or after January 16th will be listed automatically.
The Summary sheet may also be sorted for certain criteria - use the drop down 
arrows alongside the column headers to make your selection.

This sheet contains all the information you are used to seeing, but slightly 
reformatted.  Key points are: 
In the case of an Inactivation, the cause of the Inactivation (eg Merger) is 
listed in the Comments section
As with the previous format, 
all months' reports will be sent cumulatively throughout the year
the report will be sent out twice each month, on the 15th and at the end of 
the month.


It is our aim to publish the report in Livelink and to send out only the 
summary sheet and a URL for the detailed report each month.  This will save a 
lot of space in Lotus Notes and we hope it will streamline your monitoring 
process.

We'd be very happy to receive any comments you may have.

		 Subject: NGX/CEL Litigation - Agenda for Tomorrow

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL

I think we need to talk to the following issues tomorrow:

1.  Status update on court proceedings;

2.  Evidentiary matters, including:

(a)  formal industry support for our position - without it, we are fighting 
an uphill battle, and I understand the other side will be filing evidence of 
industry support for their position; and 

(b)  a detailed and focused analysis of the pre-NGX and post-NGX index 
consequences, in terms of volume and pricing consequences - our analysis to 
date has proven weak;

3.  Goals, including can we live with the risk of no CGPR AECO index.  In 
other words, our best argument is likely that CGPR cannot pass off what it 
purports to be an AECO index reflecting the broader market, but NGX (and EOL 
for that matter) are free to publish their own index.  The result might be 
that NGX (or EOL for that matter) is free to publish their own index, 
provided it is not passed of as being the CGPR AECO index reflecting the 
broader market, and Enerdata then must publish the broader index, if it 
wishes, as the CGPR AECO index.  However, if CGPR chose not to continue 
publishing, it is likely going to be free to do so, with the effect that 
there would be no CGPR AECO index as referred to in our Confirms and 
Transactions, which would have to then be altered to account for a separate 
and new index, which for the time being could be NGX or EOL.

I have asked our outside lawyers to join in on the call at 2:00 p.m. (Calgary 
time) tomorrow.

Subject:	Research Group Teamwork

Vince,
Over the past year and a half, I have been continually impressed with the richly diverse and highly collaborative working environment you created among members of the Research Group.  As you know, I pay attention to ""people"" issues in my work, and seldom have I observed such a successful and diverse team environment.   
I believe that this experience is worth sharing with others and would like to write about it.  The purpose of the project would be to capture and share learnings related to the dynamics of the Research Group; larger Enron issues would not be included.  The writing would be based on interviews with you and perhaps ten others in the department.  Anything I write would be approved by those who are quoted, and the complete article would be reviewed and approved by you before being shared outside.  I do not expect to receive any financial support for the effort; I have some time now and enjoy doing the kind of effort I'm proposing.  I can show you a sample of similar, previously-published works I've done.  
I realize that these days are already confusing and draining for you all.  On the other hand, this is a good time, perhaps the only time, to capture the wisdom that each of you has gained from this team experience.  If you have interest in my pursuing this idea, would you be available to talk with me further in the next couple of days?
Respectfully, 
Ann Thomas  (Bob Lee's wife)     "

Can we please amend the collateral threshold in the draft ISDA for the above 
referenced counterparty?  The new collateral threshold amount should be 
$2,500,000.  No other changes are necessary to the document and I hope 
therefore that a full credit worksheet will not be necessary.

Please call me if you have any questions.  Fred is looking for this asap, so 
if we could have it to him by noon or so tomorrow, he will be quite 
appreciative.


Thanks,

As an overview, this proposal:

*   Maintains the basic Gas Accord structure in place today for the

*   
*   Offers end user transportation rates for 2003 lower for most
customers than rates in effect today.

*   Provides for vintaged Redwood path rates for core customers.
*   
*   Offers a 7.5 cent/dth rate to large customers while minimizing rate
changes to other customers, minimizing the incentive for these customers to
seek to bypass local transmission charges and other CPUC-approved charges.
*   
*   Adopts guidelines to improve reliability and help moderate prices in
gas commodity markets, and identifies the capital projects needed to meet
these guidelines over the course of the GA II period (2003-2007).  
*   
*   Provides a high degree of rate stability, with a 3.5% escalator to
capture both inflation and the cost of needed capital projects.  The
guaranteed rates will be adjustable only for significant changes in the cost
of capital or increased costs due to governmental requirements or
catastrophic events.
*   
*   Preserves a rate differential between the Redwood and Baja paths,
although somewhat less than the current differential.
*   
*   Proposes a two-stage open season for firm transportation services
beginning in 2003, with end users receiving a first option on available
capacity.
*   
*   Maintains the core aggregation program with some adjustments.

PG&E also anticipates that the Core Procurement Incentive Mechanism (CPIM)
will be similar to today's mechanism, but will reflect the somewhat larger
capacity holdings needed to meet anticipated increases in core demand and to
meet a 1-day in 10-year cold weather event.

This also will serve as a reminder that an all-Party meeting is scheduled at
PG&E's headquarters in San Francisco on January 10 and 11, to discuss this
proposal and to respond to your questions.  We look forward to answering
your questions and receiving your feedback.

The attached documents include the GA II Settlement proposal, an Attachment
(a copy of PG&E's proposed Gas Rule 27), and a set of supporting workpapers.

Finally, please note that the Settlement document and the Attachment are in
""Word 2000"" format.  We would be glad to provide the same documents in an
earlier version of Word, upon request by individual Parties.

We look forward to seeing you on January 10-11.  In the meantime, we extend
our best wishes for a safe and happy holiday season.

I was chatting with Chapman yesterday, and he tells me the movie you were in 
is Gladiator.  This is major!  I had no idea you were in the biggest hit of 
the summer, and probably the year.  How will I know which barbarian is you?  
Can we see your face?  Does your horse have special markings so we can tell 
it's you?  I'm going to have to watch it in slo mo when it comes out in video!

This is quite exciting.  I guess next thing you'll be hiring an agent (for 
you and/or your horse, depending on who gets better reviews?!)...

And, as usual, thanks for being great hosts yesterday (Nancy, you outdid 
yourself with dinner).

OK, so I am doing everything that I can to leave for the Dome Wednesday 
night.  If you guys want, we can pack up the Suburban with everything that 
needs to go up ( or at least just about everything), and we can drive it up 
and then you two can take my SAAB up.  Then, coming back, you can drive the 
Suburban and I can drive the SAAB.  What do you think?

Finally, Eldon, do you have the Blue Book at your house?  I'm looking for the 
number of someone I can get to haul away all the crap (junk from around the 
generator shed, that rotten ol' pile of wood by the driveway, the 
un-salvagable wood from the old deck, etc.).  Can you find a couple ""hauler""

The draft CA does not mention Peoples having to get their consultants to sign 
the CA, but I can put something in.

Hi Kathleen,

I want to get Laura Luce to direct us to give Gregg signing authority.  As 
you know, the request for Ben came from Janet, not Ben. I'll check with her.  
do you have the LLC agreement to see how changes are handled?  If not, you 
can get a copy of my copy.  It is not a standard agreement.

On the CA, please make the effective period two years from the latest 
disclosure of info, and the disclosures will be ongoing. I don't have the CA 
in front of me, but does it say that Peoples has to get their consultants to 
sign a CA as well?  It is a good question.

Ta ta for now,

Kay

Kay,

Gregg posed an interesting question yesterday regarding the Confidentiality 
Agreement.  If Peoples supplies our confidential information to Arthur 
Andersen, and someone from AA tells the world our secrets, would Peoples be 
on the hook pursuant to our CA?  I guess one way we could take care of this 
would be to include Arthur Andersen on Schedule I of the CA as one of 
Peoples' Representatives.  Any thoughts?

Also, I will work on getting Gregg signing authority re his message below.

Subject: Re: enovate stuff

Kathleen - This e-mail should aid in the preparation of the Board 
Resolutions.  The attached file lists the appointment changes.  As for my 
signature authority, I am expecting that I would need to sign on behalf of 
enovate, L.L.C., Enron MW, L.L.C. and I suppose Enron North America by 
association.  The dollar amount can be set as low as practical.  I think in 
the L.L.C. agreement the Board reserves the right to approve contracts in 
excess of $50,000.  The real need is for pushing paper such as CA's, Master 
Purchase Agreements, etc.  Here is another question, if my authority is 
limited, who has the authority to sign in excess of my limit?  Laura Luce 
previously had such authority as General Manager (she is a VP at ENA).  If 
she now becomes the Board Member, can she also sign on behalf of enovate?  If 
so, is that because she is an officer of Enron MW or because she is a Board 
Member (i.e., can Peoples Board Member sign on behalf of enovate)?

Thanks - Gregg

1)

3) I think we want it to apply to whatever entity employs the individuals 
with access.  Most of these people will probably Peoples Energy Corp. 
employees, but I suppose we could make it also include all of their 
affiliates.  enovate can sign the CA as well, but since enovate doesn't have 
any employees I was assuming we could use Peoples Energy as the responsible 
legal entity.

4) After 3:00 is fine, let me know for sure soon enough that I can lock Sarah 
up.

Subject: enovate stuff

Kay - 

1) Attached is my quick attempt at writing something to make the management 
changes at enovate that we discussed.  Could you please review this and add 
the appropriate legal language.  I don't think that we need any Board 
approval for any of these changes, so is some type of notification sufficient?

2)  I would like to address the idea of signature authorities other than 
Laura at the same time.  My suggestion would be that Richard and myself be 
granted some level of authority to execute CA's, Master Agreements, etc. that 
have been reviewed and approved by legal.  If you can at least pull the 
template you used to get approval for the Director you mentioned and see if 
there would be any changes necessary that would be helpful.

3) I need to get the CA form for the curves and other information started.  
We can discuss this any time you want.

4) What is your availability tomorrow either 8-9:15 or after 3:00 to discuss 
the intercompany loan agreement, and will Heather be available?

I will be leaving around 2:00 for suburban trick or treating.

Thanks,

Gregg

The European jurisdictions which are not approved to trade credit derivatives 
include:  France, Germany, Gibraltar, Ireland, Italy, Scotland, Spain, and 
The Netherlands.   For banks incorporated in a non-approved jurisdiction, it 
may be possible for them to trade out of a branch located in an approved

Subject: Re: Option P&L =20


Brad,

I was extreamly busy yesterday.  Sorry for answing your question till now.

Although I am not exactly sure how  the system handle gamma, this is what I=
=20
think the system is doing:


Curve shift =3D today's price - yesterady's price

P/L due to curve shift =3D today's market value using today's price curve (=
with=20
everything esle the same as yesterday's) - yesterday's market value using=
=20
yesterday's price curve.

So P/L due to curve shift contains both delta and gamma and higher order=20
terms.
We then use theoretical gamma (meaning option model gamma: 0.5*gamma * (pri=
ce=20
change)2 ) for gamma contribution and?define delta =3D curve shift - theore=
tical gamma.??Therefore, the gamma may not be very accurate to explain the =
delta change, ?especially when you have big price change due to higher orde=
r contribution. ??Let me know your thoughts on this.???Best wishes,??Zimin?=

Subject: Bahamas LNG

Steve --

In a discussion today with Mike, Kelly, etc., it was apparent that the Public 
Affairs team viewed the Bahamas LNG transaction quite cautiously.  Given the 
recent issues power plant development has had in Florida (big political 
fights that are going the wrong way), I was wondering if it made sense to 
bring together a meeting of all of Public Affairs and the deal team to 
analyze the implications of our development plans.  My primary worry is that 
P/L under water could have severe ecological implications that are not being 
internalized into the transaction.

I would like to try and arrange a meeting to (1) ensure Public Affairs 
coordination and (2) understand the deal impacts better. 

Please advise if I'm worrying for no good reason.

Jim

Subject: Brown Bag Dessert On Option Pricing

Hi all,
Martin has kindly arranged the following presentation for us.  Come and enjoy 
it. 

Zimin, Alex

Giuseppe Paleologo of Stanford and Enron Research Summer Intern fame will 
present a talk on 
  IP Pricing 
at 1pm in EB 46C2, Friday, March 9.

Below is a description of the topic.

Because of the bursty and intermittent nature of IP traffic, 
""oversubscription"" is possible.  
In telephone or cell phone networks, selling more lines than the physical 
capacity is 
commonplace.  When too many users access the lines at 5pm, busy signals 
result.  With service level agreements that call for damages to be paid when 
capacity is unavailable, simple busy signals will not do.  An approach to 
this 
issue and thoughts on the trade off between oversubscription and liquidated 
damages will be the focus of this interesting talk.
"
"I think the easiest way is a power of attorney.  I've talked to Deb Korkmas 
about it (I hear she's the one to handle such things), and I've asked 
Kathleen to identify the most active development entities so that we deal 
with as many as possible at once.

As for the expense account, I figure she can just tell Ben to sign her name 
to the reports.  ANy other ideas?

Sally, Attached are two draft slides that we wish to include in the analyst

of the data necessary to complete the slides.

The slides are basically maps of our power and gas operations but surrounded 
with some hard data on particular aspects of the business to demonstrate our 
scope and size. I would suggest that the maps are printed out and you will 
then easily see the data we require and the format we wish to use to present 
it. However , in summary the information needed is:

GAS
Storage Capability, Leased and Owned
Number of Counterparties - 1997, 1998, 1999
Contract type by customer in  %  - I have segregated by Industrials, LDCs, 
and Other, but I am open for  better suggestions
Transport contracts - bcf/d - firm and Interruptible, 
Term of contracts  - I suggested ,<1 year,< 10years, >10years  but again am 
open for more appropriate terms
Peak daily deliveries - Btue/d - 1997, 1998, 1999

POWER
Contract type by customer in  %  - I have segregated by Marketers, Utilities 
and Other, but I am open for  better suggestions
Term of contracts  - I suggested ,<1 year,< 10years, >10years  but again am 
open for more appropriate terms
Number of counterparties -1996,1997, 1998, 1999

If there is data that you or your team believe is more appropriate to 
demonstrate our activities in these markets please let me know. I will be 
very grateful for such additional material and information . 

As always our timeline is tight and would therefore appreciate the data by 
close of business Friday.   
Let me know how this works

So, Meg called and asked me to contact one of the individuals on your list
of names because that person - Ashish Bhargava- had a specific question
around choosing between day and evening programs. Since I had to make a
similar decision, Meg thought I should talk to him. 

If you have already called him, don't worry about it.  If not, go ahead and
we can trade someone from my list, and I will call Ashish.  Just let me know
who you pick on my list!

Subject: New Admissions Calls


Comrades:

Attached you will find the call assignments for the
new admits.  We all have five or six people to call in
the next 7-10 days.   I made a couple of matches where
it seemed there was some kind of similarity in
background or career, but for the most part, the
assignments were essentially random.  The list
includes names, phones at home and work, company and
title.

Remember these are newly admitted students who have
not yet accepted our offer of admission.  The deadline
to accept this offer is April 27th.

A general outline of the phone call, should you choose
to use it, would be:

1) Congratulations on being admitted to the Haas
School

2) indentify yourself as ""involved with the student
government at the Haas School, and the evening office
asked me to give you a call to see if you had any
questions about the program.  Then answer the
questions, if you can, or refer them to me or Ken for
further follow-up

3)describe your own experience at school and how it
has worked with your career--timing, advancement,
scheduling, tuition payments, etc.

4)invite them to attend a class so we can show them
around.  EMBA office will coordinate.

5)remind them of the ""New Students Admit Reception"" on
April 19th from 7-9 in the Wells Fargo Room (drinks
and hors d'oeuvres served). (Refer to Diane's recent
email for other particulars. 

Some pieces of information you might want to have
handy
 
-required new student orientation is August 11-12;
classes start on the 13th

-fees will be $1580 per unit; 42 units required,
including the two units for MPAR

-orientation packages will be sent out mid-June

-administration will call each new student in July
with class schedules

-second round of admits come out in early June

Thanks very much for helping.  Let me know if there is
anything else you may need or could suggest to help in
this effort.

Morris has re-set the hearing for August 22-24.  Final briefs are due August
15.  Up to the parties to negotiate revised discovery deadlines.

I assume witness designations and summaries are still due this Saturday,
meaning Monday.

Please let Brian Redmond (and anyone else who needs to know) know about the
change.  In particular, please advise our witnesses (unless you want me to
call them directly).

Please send me Andy's email address, as I do not have it.

Please keep us posted as to the developments on the business side re
commercial solution.

excess of 100 candidates.  The interviews will begin at 9:00 a.m. and will

"FYI.  Latest word is that Assembly, Senate and Administration staff have been locked in a room with orders not to emerge until they've struck a deal on the Edison MOU.  

Word on DA is not good.  Thus far it appears that the PUC ""study"" outlined in the letter from Burton & Co. to Lynch is as far as the Senate wants to go at this time, but folks continue to push.  Seems to be a possibility that, if the Legislature does reconvene, there may be a push by ""green Senators"" to pass a ""green only"" DA bill.

In addition, Lynch is setting the stage to have the PUC reject the rate agreement between DWR and the PUC on Tuesday.  This despite the Governor calling to vigorously lobby each of the commissioners.  Despite the strong arm tactics, it appears that Brown may be the only aye vote at this point.

The idea is that, if the PUC votes down the rate agreement, the only thing Davis will have left is 18XX.  

We'll report back with news as we get it.

Best,
Jeff

Subject: MOU Update


I spoke to the three primary Senate consultants dealing with energy.  As of
9:30 a.m. this morning the Governor has still not officially called for a
Third Extraordinary Session, or, for the Second Extraordinary Session to
reconvene.  In fact, Senate staff is continuing to prepare for their annual
golf excursion next Tuesday. In addition, while staff from the Senate and
the Administration have met, the Administration has yet to produce either a
new version of SBX2 78, or, amendments to the existing version of SBX2 78.
Staff reiterated that they believe there is still no chance of passing SBX2
78 in its current form."

Subject: Monkey Business

My recollection is that each of you is somewhat of a baseball fan, as I am.  
I just happen to have 4 great seats for Opening Day at Enron Field, for which 
I very much need company to help me enjoy.  I would love it if each of you 
could join me.  The game starts at 4:05 pm, so it might require leaving the 
office a little early.  But of course we would be discussing serious business 
the entire time so that it would be fully justifiable to anyone interested.  
I will bring my legal pad to take notes. 

Let me know.  Hope you can come.

Most of these were just April deals, and it looks like they all suffered from 
the same incorrect default we ran into before. On the longer term deals I 
made sure to choose ""no"" when it asked if I would like to clear all routes 
for the deal; but let me know if you find anything out of the ordinary.

Thanks,
Kate

		 Subject: Enron Japan agreements (ISDA/futures/brokerage)

John:  I just wanted to stay in the loop for Japan as to Gary Hickerson's 
FX/rate/equity counterparties.  My understanding from Gary is that  EGM 
(through ENA) will continue to hedge the business originating in Japan, 
subject to tax and any regulatory input.  I don't know if this has 
necessitated an agency arrangement  between Japan and Houston (or another 
office, similar to London or Australia).  Also, for netting reasons, Japan 
would not duplicate existing counterparty  ISDA's with ENA, and to the extent 
Japan is transacting with a bank having an agreement with ENA, we could amend 
the agreement for multibranch purposes if necessary (e.g., Bank of Montreal 
if the bank is transacting from multiple locations that need to be added to 
ENA's agreement).

Please advise if you have already had these discussions with Mark Taylor.  I 
look forward to hearing from you.  Sara  "

Subject: Re: LM6K Change Order #2 Revised  

Here are my comments after reviewing the below change order: (i) the cover 
page refers to an enron 2-99 deal which does not correspond to the cover page 
of the executed turbine purchase contract with GE.  To what does this refer 
if a different deal and if the same deal, please conform.  (ii) the effective 
date is stated as March 6, 2000.  Given that the agreement between Enron and 
WestLB and the purchase agreement between WestLB and GE weren't signed until 
May 12, 2000, if any backdating is needed (I'd like to understand why it is 
for new equipment orders), it can't be before May 12th.  With respect to the 
effective date and the overall placement of the order, has this $4.65MM 
acquisition been dashed?  The current effective dash only contemplated the 
turbines, not any ancillary equipment.  I believe Chip Schneider is the RAC 
contact for this transaction.

Subject: Compound Model for Reedy Creek

Alex,

Paulo and I have continued to look at the model and have come up with a 
couple of additional changes.

1.   The cash flow calculations need to include the overlying option strike 
payment.   Also, Paulo is trying to clarify if the cashflows should be 
discounted to the valuation date or reported as notional future values.
2.  I would suggest trying changing the option valuation from a binomial tree 
approach to a one-dimensional integration, perhaps using a quadrature 
method.  This may allow us to minimize the size of the delta discontinuities.
3.  Edith is supposed to check and see if the theoretical gamma is used for 
anything.   If it is, we will probably need to revisit the gamma calculation 
since we are not currently including any cross terms for gamma.

Thanks,

Stinson

As reported in both the trade press and national media, SoCal Ed and the CP=
UC=20
are pointing
the finger of blame at El Paso for alleged manipulation of California borde=
r=20
prices through
affiliate deals and capacity hoarding. And exhibit A in their case against =
El=20
Paso is The Brattle
Group=01,s study of the California market.

Richard Zeiger, a spokesman for Assembly Member Darrell Steinberg, chairman=
=20
of the
California Assembly Judiciary Committee, told Gas Daily that The Brattle=20
Group=01,s market
study proved that the surge in gas prices at the California border was not=
=20
caused by normal
market forces (GD 4/20). His remarks followed an oversight hearing during=
=20
which Assembly
members questioned Dynegy and El Paso officials about their involvement in=
=20
the California
market.

El Paso presented a different version of events to the Assembly. In a repor=
t=20
presented to
legislators, a research group hired by El Paso concluded that a convergence=
=20
of factors, not a
conspiracy, caused the price run-up.

Lukens Consulting Group, a Houston-based consultancy, was retained by El Pa=
so=20
to conduct
work on several fronts. In its study of the California market, Lukens=20
concluded that the
increasing convergence of the gas and electricity businesses was one of the=
=20
main culprits in the
California gas price imbroglio.

Assemblyman John Campbell, a Republican member of the oversight committee,=
=20
said he
""didn=01,t see any smoking gun"" in either report.

""We had our committee hearing, and we certainly had a lot on the Brattle=20
Study and a little
on the Lukens study. To some degree, I=01,m not sure that the California=20
legislature is the best
place to adjudicate the differences between these two studies,"" Campbell=20
said. ""I believe FERC
is looking at this situation "" and it would seem to me that that=01,s the=
=20
appropriate place.""

Campbell said that the CPUC had been prodding the California legislature to=
=20
give support
to its claims of market power abuse by pipelines. ""It=01,s being pushed=20
basically by the Public
Utilities Commission here, which believes that there was collusion"" by=20
pipeline companies to
push up gas prices in California, he said.

The CPUC, Campbell suggested, sought satisfaction before the California=20
assembly when
it had failed on the federal level: ""There=01,s a concerted effort, not jus=
t on=20
natural gas but on other
things here in California, for entities and organizations here to point the=
=20
finger elsewhere for
the problems that we=01,re having in this state and I think you=01,re seein=
g some=20
of that with the
public utilities commission.""

Whether either report wins over the public incensed by high natural gas=20
prices is a different
matter entirely. In the meanwhile, the dueling California market studies se=
em=20
to have taken
on a life of their own.

The Brattle Group Study, for instance, has become the center of a heavily=
=20
litigated effort to
force FERC to compel the release of market data by California market=20
participants. Following
on a request by SoCal Ed, which said it needed additional data to round out=
=20
The Brattle Group
report, FERC Chief ALJ Curtis Wagner issued subpoenas to the other three=20
major pipelines that
serve the state as well as to Sempra Energy Trading.

Several parties resisted FERC=01,s call for market information, saying the=
=20
requested data
contained commercially sensitive information. FERC allowed the discovery=20
process to move
forward but only after attaching strict data protection rules restricting=
=20
access to evidence
(GD 4/23).

Critics of the pipeline industry have already suffered one setback in their=
=20
case. The commission
recently dismissed the CPUC=01,s claim that El Paso rigged the auction of a=
=20
large block of
pipeline capacity in favor of affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy. In=20
addressing the California
Assembly, representatives of Dynegy said that FERC=01,s recent ruling on th=
e=20
California border
controversy obviated the need for more investigation.

The controversy, however, is far from over. FERC last month also ordered a=
=20
hearing into
whether El Paso Natural Gas and its affiliates manipulated capacity to driv=
e=20
up the price of gas
delivered into California (GD 3/29). That hearing is likely to take place=
=20
this summer. (RP00-

  This virus warning is genuine.

There is a new virus going around, called ""work.""   If you receive any sort
of ""work"" at all, whether via email, Internet or simply handed to you by a
colleague...DO NOT OPEN IT.

This has been circulating around our building for months and those who have
been tempted to open ""work"" or even look at ""work"" have found that their
social life is deleted and their brain ceases to function properly.  If you
do encounter ""work"" via email or are faced with any ""work"" at all, then to
purge the virus, send an email to your boss with the words ""I've had enough
of your crap...  I'm off to the bar.""    Your brain should automatically
forget the ""work"".

If you receive ""work"" in paper-document form, simply lift the document and
drag the ""work"" to your garbage can.  Put on your hat and coat and skip to
the nearest bar with two friends and order three bottles of beer  (or rum
punch). After repeating this action 14 times, you will find  that ""work""
will no longer be of any relevance to you  and that ""Scooby Doo"" was the

Gerald,

As we discussed earlier, following is a list of the high points agreed upon 
in yesterday's meeting with Hanover.  Hopefully this is enough to get a draft 
of a letter agreement going.

- the compression services agreement will be terminated
- there will be a 90 day transition period starting 1/1/01within which 
Crestone will build up an operations and maintenance strategy
- during the 90 day transition, Crestone will make an election as to whether 
we want all of the O&M, part of it, or recontract with either Hanover or 
another 3rd   party  (basically we want the flexibility to do anything we 
want).
- Hanover will provide to us a rate stucture that will be in effect during 
the 90 day transition.  We talked about covering their costs (under a flat 
monthly fee) plus  a 15 to 20% markup.  We also agreed to meet with them very 
soon to define exactly who does or pays for specific services.
- We will need to address the way new units will be ordered in the future.  I 
have not worked on this yet.
- Hanover made the committment to maximize on line availability of their units
- There will be a 2 year term during which Hanover will be Crestone's 
""preferred provider"" of either rented or purchased machines.  This needs to 
be   structrured so that we dont necessarily have to use them.The term will 
start 1/1/01.

Thanks for your help.  Let me know if I can fill in some of the details for 
you.

Rick / Vince,

Good morning.

In my 9/14 e-mail, I advised you of the practitioner-industry CEFER (Center
for Energy Finance Education and Research) Conference we are planning for
Spring 2001.  As you know, we would like to invite Jeff Skilling to be the

topics consist of Risk management, Deregulation, Real options, and
International/globalization.  The majority of invitees would be
(predominantly U. S.-based) energy-industry practitioners, as well as
several academics.

Given lead time issues in these matters, we have reserved hotel rooms in
Austin for Feb. 22, 2001.  Could I ask you to ascertain Jeff Skilling's
availability for that evening?

"Greetings.  The reference is specific to statements that we made when FERC 
first issued it's proposed order on Nov. 1 regarding how to fix the mess in 
California.  We said (and FERC was a little cranky about this) that we were 
pulling 300 MWs of power plants that we'd planned to build in California on 
the basis of the price cap proposal included in FERC's proposed order.  It 
was in the press.  So it was narrowly confined to the power plant proposals.  
Calpine subsequently announced that it, too, would pull the peaking plants it 
had planned to developed.  I think that they announced the same amount would 
be pulled---300 MWs.

If you need anything else, don't hesitate to call.

*    FERC COMMISSIONER HERBERT SKIPS SAN DIEGO HEARING
     FERC's sole Republican commissioner will not be attending
today's hearings in San Diego, saying the situation has gotten
too political, according to Dow Jones Newswires.
     Commissioner Curt Herbert was quoted as saying: ""California
would rather fight this out for the next five to ten years rather
than take steps now to solve the problem."" He also expects
additional companies to join Enron Corp. and Calpine Corp. in
pulling out of the state's market, causing blackouts and ongoing
high prices next summer. ""We've had three hearings already,""
Herbert added. ""Are customers better off? I don't think so.""
     Meanwhile, State senator Debra Bowen, head of the state
Senate Energy Committee, told a hearing in Sacramento yesterday
that FERC's plan could lead to re-regulation if residents were
not protected from market manipulation. Reuters quotes Bowen as
saying: ""If there's not political accountability between the
people that are making the decisions about what California
customers pay and the people who are paying those rates, we're
likely to have a revolution at the consumer level that leads to
re-regulation regardless of what's in a FERC order"" (Dow Jones
Newswires, Reuters, Nov. 13).

ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND CONSERVATION PROGRAMS

* 20/20 Energy Rebate: Residential, commercial, and industrial customers are
eligible for this voluntary program which will provide rebates to customers
who reduce their summer 2001 electricity usage.  Customers will receive a
20% rebate on their summer electric bill if they cut back their electricity
use by 20% over last summer's level. (Direct access customers are not
eligible.)

* Low-energy usage building materials: California's commercial buildings
account for 36% of the state's annual electricity use.  During peak times,
commercial buildings use 11% of the state's electricity for lighting and 15%
for air conditioning. Funds will be used to identify and buy-down the cost
of energy measures, such as ""white roofs,"" used to retrofit commercial
buildings for energy efficiency.

DEMAND REDUCTION PROGRAMS FOR BUSINESS

INVESTOR-OWNED UTILITY (IOU) INTERRUPTIBLE PROGRAMS:

* Voluntary Demand Response Program (VDRP): This is a voluntary bid-based
program for the commercial sector that pays $350 a megawatt hour to
companies dropping loads either the day of or the day before load relief is
needed.  This program is open to customers who can curtail at least 15% of
load, with a minimum load drop of 100kW.

http://www.sdge.com/efficiency/index.html; 1-800-411-SDGE

* Optional Binding Mandatory Curtailment Program (OBMC): The program exempts
participants from rotating black-outs if they can reduce the load on their
entire circuit by the required amount (5 to 20%) for the entire duration of
every rotation outage (outages are usually for one hour).

* New Base Interruptible Program (BIP): This program limits interruptions to
one 4-hour event per day, 10 events per month, and 120 hours per year and
provides a $7 per kW-month credit to participants.  Alternatively, a $6 per
kW penalty will be imposed for consumption in excess of firm service load.
This program is open to customers who can commit at least 15% of load, with
a minimum of 100kW per event.

INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR (ISO) INTERRUPTIBLE PROGRAMS:

* Demand Reduction Program (DRP): This program will pay customers a monthly
reservation payment of $20,000/MW/month to be available on weekdays between
11:00 AM and 7:00 PM from June 1 through September 30 to curtail at ISO
request, and will additionally receive $500/MWh for curtailed demand.  This
program is open to customers with a minimum aggregated load bid of 1 MW.
Total curtailment time is limited to 24hr/month.

Contact: Don Fuller (916) 351-4445 <http://www2.caiso.com/clientserv/load/>

* Discretionary Curtailment Program (DLCP): This program is similar to the
VDRP.  It is a voluntary program that will pay customers a similar incentive
to the VDRP to curtail load when called upon by the ISO.  This program is
open to customers with a minimum aggregated load of 1 MW.

Contact: Don Fuller (916) 351-4445 <http://www2.caiso.com/clientserv/load/>

METERING AND OTHER DEMAND-RESPONSIVE SYSTEMS

CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION (CEC) PROGRAMS:

* Time-of-Use Meters (CEC and IOUs): Businesses with loads over 200 kW per
month will receive meters that will enable them to better track and manage
their energy use and participate in demand reduction programs.

Contact: Don Kazama CEC website and 800 number
www.energy.ca.gov/peakload; 1-800-555-7794

* Demand Responsive Building Systems: This program provides grants to
businesses to reduce demand in commercial buildings.  This technology
reduces electricity demand during peak periods by automatically raising
thermostats, dimming appropriate lighting and reducing the electricity use
of other building systems.

Contact: Scott Matthews CEC website and 800 number
www.energy.ca.gov/peakload; 1-800-555-7794

* Innovative Peak Load Reduction: This program takes full advantage of the
innovations of the private sector to generate innovative solutions to reduce
peak demand. Grants will be awarded to businesses for efficiency projects
including, but not limited to, lighting and cooling efficiency improvements,
solar cooling, building energy management controls, electric generation from
landfill gas, and solar systems.

MORE ENERGY SAVING PROGRAMS AND TIPS:

* Inspectors from private firms called ESCOs (Energy Service Companies) can
audit your building, identify how you can reduce energy costs, specify the
equipment needed, finance the project, install the equipment and then
guarantee that it will operate properly. Generally, the ESCO shares the
financial risk associated with the project and in return keeps some of the
savings on your energy bill. Call your utility company for more details.

GOVERNOR'S RATE PROPOSAL:

The Governor's proposal allocates the same percentage rate increase to
residential and to commercial/industrial customers and makes changes only to
businesses' current rate structures.  Customers on time-of-use rates, as
well as those who are not, would receive the same percentage increase.
Time-of-use increases would be allocated only to the peak and mid-peak
rates, in an effort to encourage more intensive conservation at times when
it is most needed. The Governor also supports a direct access option for
business customers that ensures the financial stability of the bridge loan
and revenue bonds that are needed to back the state's power purchases.

Gentlemen,

Due to some internal comments we have made some revisions to the land
option agreement.  The most significant change is that it is clear that the
option payment is not refundable, and will not be applied against the
purchase price.  There is also a clarification in paragraph 9 (re
assignment) that the assignee remains responsible for any liability arising
prior to assignment.

I believe we are ready to go forward with signature when you are.  Please
advise if this version is acceptable.  Also, please let me know if you
would like for me to have a redline version prepared.

Hi Kay -

You may recall that back in February, we almost finalized two
confidentiality agreements related to enovate L.L.C. activities.  Our
auditors will be sending to enovate shortly a letter indicating they would
like to review various books and records of enovate and ENA as its
activities relate to enovate.  In connection with the review, we need to
finalize those confidentiality agreements.

I have made the change you requested in the attached e-mail to both of the
agreements (PEC and enovate) and have attached below an execution copy of
the agreements for ENA to date and send to PEC and enovate for siganture.
Assuming the attached copies are acceptable, please have ENA sign two
originals of each agreement and send them to me.  I'll arrange for Bill
Morrow to sign the PEC agreement and work with Greg Penmen to have enovate
sign the other agreement.

If you have any questions, please call.  Thanks for your assistance.

2. Key Barriers to Distributed Generation

Excessive and Unnecessary Utility Stand-by Charges

Solution: The executive orders issued by the Governor on February 14th took=
 a=20
step in the right direction.  Utility stand-by charges have always been=20
designed by the utilities to protect their monopoly position, extract=20
monopoly prices from customers, or both.  But there is no reason to limit t=
he=20
elimination of these charges to generation facilities that are less than=20
1MW.  These limits will only lengthen unnecessarily the time it takes for=
=20
California to close the significant gap between supply and demand and reduc=
e=20
the risk of black outs.  We would propose lifting the cap through amendment=
s=20
to SB27X, which is designed to facilitate development of distributed=20
generation.
=20
Excessive delays and costs related to interconnecting facilities with=20
investor-owned and municipal utilities

Solution:   The Governor=01,s executive order regarding interconnection is =
a=20
step in the right direction=01*D-D-26-01 requires utilities to complete=20
interconnection studies within 7 days.  California should ensure that this=
=20
requirement applies to all generation facilities, including distributed=20
generation.  In addition, the financial conflicts the utilities face when=
=20
interconnecting generation facilities are simply too powerful to overcome=
=20
through executive orders or other regulations.  To the greatest extent=20
possible, California should shift control over interconnection away from th=
e=20
utility and place that control with the California ISO.  This could be=20
accomplished through amendments to SB 27X.

Permitting and Air Quality Issues
Developers of distributed (i.e., =01&on-site=018) generation that is 50 MWs=

=20
output apply equally to smaller scale, =01&distributed generation=018 facil=

In addition, distributed generation that is less than 50 MWs continues to=
=20
face local opposition.  The State should ensure that local, parochial=20
interests cannot block otherwise beneficial distributed generation projects=
. =20
These objectives could be accomplished through amendments to SB27X.

3. Credit Concerns Regarding Authority Granted to DWR in AB1X to Purchase=
=20

Enron responded to the RFP issued by DWR to enter into power contracts with=
=20

Enron is in active discussions with DWR to establish contract terms with th=

risk concerns.
Enron has proposed several options for resolving the credit risk issues and=
=20
is working with DWR to arrive at a solution that is mutually agreeable to=
=20
both sides and that might serve as a template for power purchase agreements=
=20
going forward.

Summary of the Source of the Credit Risk Issue

Ambiguous Ratemaking Authority
The language in AB1X leaves ambiguous whether DWR has any authority to char=
ge=20
California ratepayers for the costs of purchasing power.  From our analysis=
=20
of the bill, the language in AB1X appears to leave intact the California PU=
C=01,
s exclusive jurisdiction over ratemaking in California.  As such, suppliers=
=20
have no assurance that the PUC will agree to include in rates adequate=20
charges to cover DWR=01,s costs of power purchases.

Ambiguous Regulatory Authority Regarding Contract =01&Prudence=018
The language in AB1X leaves open the possibility that the California Public=
=20
Utilities Commission could determine that power purchases made by DWR are=
=20
=01&imprudent.=018  On the basis of such a finding, the CPUC could then ref=
use to=20
allow DWR to collect from ratepayers the costs associated with its power=20
purchases.  Consequently, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agr=
ee=20
to include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that=
=20
DWR has entered into with suppliers.
=20
Ambiguous Language Regarding the Ratemaking Mechanism that Will Be Used to=
=20
Recover DWR=01,s Costs of Power Purchases
In addition to the ambiguity regarding ratemaking and regulatory authority=
=20
noted above, the language in the bill is equally ambiguous with respect to=
=20
the specific ratemaking =01&mechanics=018 that AB1X directs the PUC to empl=
oy to=20
permit DWR to recover its power purchase costs. Based on our analysis, it i=
s=20
extremely difficult to determine how the PUC would design the rates to ensu=
re=20
DWR recovers its power purchase costs.  Moreover, as currently drafted, it =
is=20
difficult to determine whether AB1X would even permit the PUC to include in=
=20
rates all of the charges necessary to fully recover DWR=01,s power purchase=
=20
costs.  Again, this ambiguity raises significant credit risk concerns since=
=20
suppliers have little assurance that DWR will have the ability to recover=
=20
from ratepayers the costs of purchasing power.

Options to Resolve Concerns Regarding Credit Risk=20

We have been working diligently with DWR officials to resolve the credit ri=
sk=20
issues.  We have identified three options:

Amend AB1X
The amendments, which are attached to this email, would clarify that a) the=
=20
PUC would accept as =01&prudent and reasonable=018 all purchase costs incur=
red by=20
DWR, and b) the PUC is obligated to include in rates the charges necessary =
to=20
ensure that DWR fully recovers its costs of power purchases.  This is the=
=20
preferred option, though we understand that the there may be some political=
=20
challenges standing in the way of amending AB1X.  (See attached file=20
entitled, =01&AmendAB1X.doc=018.)

Clarify the Ambiguities in AB1X through an Order Issued by the PUC, and=20
through Contract Language
This is the option that we are currently working with DWR officials to=20
implement.  However, it is more complicated and could take significantly mo=
re=20
time to implement than the ""legislative"" fix.  We have attached electronic=
=20
copies of the talking points related to the order that the California PUC=
=20
would need to issue under this option.  (See attached file entitled,=20
=01&cpuctalkingpoints.doc.=018)

Make Use of Other Instruments Designed to Address Credit Risk
As indicated in our letter responding to DWR=01,s RFP, we are willing to ac=
cept=20
other forms of credit from DWR.  Those options include a letter of credit,=
=20
cash prepayment, or an acceptable form of collateral.  DWR officials have=
=20
indicated to us that DWR prefers to pursue the second options. That is, DWR=
=20
prefers to clarify the ambiguities in AB1X through a PUC order and through=
=20
contract amendments.

4. California=01,s Supply-demand Picture Heading into Summer 2001

Both the California Energy Commission and Cambridge Energy Research=20
Associates (CERA), a private sector energy think tank, have issued reports=
=20
showing that California faces a severe supply-demand imbalance.  They diffe=
r=20
only on how much and how soon additional supply will be made available.  Al=
l=20
credible sources agree that supply will be very tight throughout the Summer=
=20
of 2001 and that unless a solution is found immediately, blackouts are=20
likely. =20

CEC and CERA both forecast that California will be short of supply this=20
summer by approximately 5,000 MW.   These numbers are in line with our=20
estimates.  California=01,s supply base currently has a 6% capacity margin,=
 well=20
below the average 15-20%, which is recommended for reliable system operatio=
n=20
in the West.  Since the West relies more heavily upon hydroelectric power=
=20
than other regions, reserves are particularly important, owing to the=20
unpredictability of the weather and the dry year the West has experienced t=
o=20
date. In the event of a low rain and snow period, the system must possess t=
he=20
flexibility to respond to the reduced availability of power supply. =20
California=01,s very low reserve margin makes it especially susceptible to =
this=20
requirement. =20

Other reasons for reduced supply for the Summer of 2001 include the early=
=20
draw-down of reservoirs in the continual effort to manage California's seve=
re=20
supply-demand gap; emissions restrictions on existing plants; and a reduced=
=20
number of customers who can be curtailed under their contracts with the=20
utilities.  Cambridge Energy Research Associates asserts that at the curren=
t=20
pace of siting, permitting and construction, adequate supplies will not be=
=20
added to correct the market imbalance until 2003 at the earliest.

CERA predicts that California is likely to face approximately 20 hours of=
=20
rolling black outs this summer.  The CEC paints a considerably more=20
optimistic scenario, betting that California will bring an additional 5,000=
=20
MWs on line to meet peaking summer demand.  It is our view that California=
=20
should view the CEC's ""rosy scenario"" with considerable skepticism.

5. Suggested Package of Legislative Proposals Designed to Solve California=
=01,s=20
Electricity Crisis

This email offers an overview of our proposed legislative solution.  We wil=
l=20
deliver to your office tomorrow specific legislative language and existing=
=20
bills that we believe can accommodate our proposals.

As we have suggested throughout the crisis, any solution to California's=20
crisis must focus on four issues:

Increase supply
Decrease demand
Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market
Return California=01,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency

Increase supply--Legislative vehicle: SB28X (Sher)
To site and construct a power plant in Texas takes approximately 2 years. =
=20
Enron and others have completed the entire process in other states in less=
=20
than a year.  In California, complex and costly air quality regulations=20
exacerbate California=01,s inability to site power plants. =20

The Governor=01,s executive orders and Senator Sher=01,s siting reform legi=
slation=20
are steps in the right direction.  Our suggested amendments can improve tho=
se=20
efforts by further addressing the difficulties that project developers face=
=20
in securing air emission reduction credits to meet the air permit=20
requirements included in the CEC's certification requirements.  Enron=01,s=
=20
proposal seeks to streamline the process for 1) obtaining credits and 2)=20
transferring credits between air districts.  In addition, it creates an=20
innovative emissions reduction bank to allow project sponsors to fund=20
emissions in advance of obtaining certification, and permits the affected a=
ir=20
districts to use those funds to finance projects that will produce the=20
required reductions in pollution emissions.

Decrease demand=01*Legislative Vehicle:   AB31X
Because of the delay in getting a solution in place in California=01,s, clo=
sing=20
the supply-demand gap through energy conservation and efficiency offers the=
=20
best chance of avoiding blackouts this summer.  This can be accomplished mo=
st=20
effectively and quickly in two ways:

Buy-down demand
California is tapping into an enormous amount of money from the General Fun=
d=20
to finance DWR=01,s power purchases.  California could likely reduce demand=
 more=20
cheaply by running an auction to determine the payments businesses would be=
=20
willing to receive to reduce their demand for a sustained period (e.g.,=20
through the summer months).  DWR could easily run an on-line auction to=20
determine the price it could pay for these demand reductions.  To=20
participate, businesses would be required to have the metering equipment=20
necessary to monitor and verify that they are actually achieving the=20
reductions.  Enron has developed an on-line auction software package, =01&D=
eal=20
Bench,=018 that it would be willing to contribute to the effort.

Use Price Signals to Incent Voluntary Curtailment
To work, customers need access to the following key elements:

An internet based hour-ahead price posting system to track the market price=
=20
for hour-ahead power in real time.=20
Real-time metering systems for baseline demand and voluntarily curtailment=
=20
verification.
Settlement process that allows for market clearing prices of energy to be=
=20
paid for load reduction (=01&Negawatts=018).

The potential benefits of an effective demand response program would includ=
e:

=01&creation=018 of additional summer peaking capacity in California, parti=
cularly=20
in the short term, without requiring construction of additional generation=
=20
resources.
reduction of  peak or super-peak load on the over-stressed California=20
electric system, thus potentially reducing the overall cost of electricity =
in=20
the state.
fostering of demand elasticity without subjecting customers to the full ris=
k=20
of hourly market price volatility by passing market price signals to=20
customers and allowing them to voluntarily shed load and be compensated for=
=20
responding.=20

We estimate that we could generate a summer 2001 on-peak demand response in=
=20
excess of 400 MW during certain high cost hours, and a demand response for=
=20
summer 2002 on-peak hours that could exceed 1000 MW.  We further estimate=
=20
that the market response to this program from all ESPs could be 2 to 3 time=
s=20
that amount.  We recommend that the State of California provide rebates=20
directly to customers to fund the installation of advanced metering and=20
control systems that would support load curtailment implementation.

Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market=01*Legislative vehi=
cle:=20
SB27X
The only customers who were protected from price volatility in San Diego we=
re=20
customers who chose Direct Access and signed fixed price deals with energy=
=20
service providers.  Ironically, AB1X takes that important option away from=
=20
customers and businesses.  It is critical that AB1X be amended to remove th=
e=20
prohibition against Direct Access.

Enron's legislative proposal would give customers freedom to enter into a=
=20
direct access transaction, while simultaneously addressing the Department o=
f=20
Water Resources' concerns about stranded power costs that might result from=
=20
customer migration. =20

In addition, California will only achieve a competitive retail market when=
=20
the utility is removed completely from the procurement function.  Procureme=
nt=20
is not a utility core competency, as evidenced by the dire financial=20
condition in which the utilities now find themselves.  California should=20
therefore begin now to gradually phase the utility out of the procurement=
=20
function entirely, with the goal of having all customers served by a=20
non-utility provider within 36 months.  To execute the transition, Californ=
ia=20
should hold a series of competitive solicitations over the 36-month period =
in=20
which competing service providers would bid for the right to serve segments=
,=20
or =01&tranches,=018 of utility load.

Return California=01,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency=01*Legislative =
vehicle:=20
AB18X
Utility bankruptcy will not increase supply and it will not decrease demand=
. =20
In short, bankruptcy does nothing to solve California=01,s supply-demand=20
imbalance.  In addition, bankruptcy increases the likelihood that consumers=
=20
and businesses will bear the significant financial risks of having Californ=
ia=20
State government assume the role of =01&electricity buyer=018 for an extend=
ed=20
period of time.  Finally, bankruptcy will undermine both investor confidenc=
e=20
in California's energy markets and the private sector's willingness to=20
participate in that market.

California can return the utilities to financial solvency by implementing a=
=20
series of staged rate increases.  California should design those rate=20
increases with the dual goal of returning the utilities to solvency without=

"Spotlight Report
  Exchange products seeing slow trading
  GAVIN SOUTER

  03/20/2000
  Business Insurance
  Page 3
  Copyright (C) 2000 Crain Communications, Inc. All rights
  reserved.

  Exchange-based insurance products developed in recent years have
  been somewhat slow to get off the ground.

  Although several exchanges have offered derivative contracts since
  the mid-1990s to cover insurance risks, none so far has posted a
  significant volume of trades.

  Few insurers, reinsurers or policyholders have been drawn away
  from the traditional insurance markets, where capacity remains
  abundant and relatively cheap.

  As long as those traditional markets manage to weather major
  natural catastrophes, the allure of the exchange-based products will
  remain limited, observers say.

  Also stifling the growth of the exchange-based contracts is the
  limited number of contracts available, one expert noted. Dealers, he
  said, are unable to secure a suitable hedge by laying off one
  contract against another.

  Although the various exchanges have had a good opportunity to
  establish a widely used set of new risk financing products, that has
  not been achieved, said Morton Lane, senior managing director,
  capital markets division at Gerling Global Financial Products in
  New York.

  The main problem with the existing exchanges is that they do not
  offer a sufficiently diverse array of products, he said. The only way
  to control the risks in the catastrophe options is to have a diversified
  portfolio of other contracts, and none of the exchanges currently
  offers a sufficiently broad range of options to provide for that
  hedge, he said.

  Florida windstorm options, for example, cannot be bought and then
  hedged in the same way that International Business Machines Corp.
  stock options contracts can be hedged with IBM stock, Mr. Lane
  explained.

  The exchanges might be more attractive to investors if, in addition to
  natural catastrophe options, they included options on other risks, he
  said. Those might include, for example, satellite, aviation and crop
  indexes, Mr. Lane said. ""For the insurance buyer, such exchange
  instruments would not represent the perfect risk transfer vehicle, but
  as long as they are quantifiable and indexable, they may represent a
  good surrogate,"" he said.

  The exchanges could also be used to create a derivatives market for
  over-the-counter securitized deals, if there are regular issuers of
  catastrophe bonds, Mr. Lane said.

  The soft insurance market has also hindered the growth of
  exchange-based insurance products, said Sean F. Mooney, senior
  vp and chief economist at Guy Carpenter & Co., the reinsurance
  brokerage unit of Marsh Inc. in New York.

  ""The traditional market has been so competitive that people are not
  looking for other ways of doing business,"" he said.

  At least in concept, the exchange-based deals are generally similar
  to the mortgage-backed securities that have been a huge success
  since they were introduced in the 1970s. ""There is a belief that
  alternative means of transferring risks will grow, but it is difficult to
  predict when,"" Mr. Mooney said.

  Currently, the trading that is taking place typically involves
  established insurers and reinsurers, so the exchanges have not
  brought substantial new capacity to the marketplace, he said.

  Guy Carpenter provided the index for the Bermuda Commodities
  Exchange reinsurance products. The BCE did not take off,
  however, and was suspended last year after two years of little
  activity.

  The oldest of the insurance-related, exchange-based derivative
  products are the catastrophe options traded on the Chicago Board
  of Trade, which began trading the options in 1996.

  Initially, there was substantial interest in the options, but the soft
  traditional market has hampered use of the contracts to hedge
  catastrophe exposures, said Carlton Purty, an independent broker
  at the CBOT who trades in options.

  No catastrophe option trades have been completed at the CBOT
  so far this year, he said. Last year, there was increased interest in
  the contracts because of Hurricane Floyd, but few contracts were
  traded, Mr. Purty said.

  ""I think a major, major catastrophe will have to happen before they
  really take off,"" he said.

  The contracts offer real protection, and options dealers are keen to
  trade in a new niche, but the conventional insurance and reinsurance
  markets are so soft that few companies are turning to alternative
  coverage options, Mr. Purty said.

  The Catastrophe Risk Exchange, located in Princeton, N.J., has
  radically changed its structure since it was originally announced in
  mid-1996, and it is well positioned to expand, said Frank Sweeney,
  chief operating officer.

  CATEX initially planned to be a computer-based facility for
  reinsurers that would enable them to exchange catastrophe risks
  and to build balanced portfolios.

  But by the time the exchange was operational in November 1996, it
  was clear that most reinsurers and insurers interested in CATEX
  wanted only to buy and sell conventional reinsurance, Mr. Sweeney
  said.

  Although there was some interest in risk swapping, only a handful of
  risks were posted on the system, and none was traded, Mr.
  Sweeney said.

  Consequently, CATEX has become chiefly a ""cash for cover""
  exchange, he said, noting that the risks reinsured on the exchange
  include property catastrophe coverage, aviation and liability
  coverages. CATEX also trades industry loss warranties, where
  coverage is triggered by an actual loss combined with an industry
  loss over an agreed threshold.

  Other adjustments to the exchange included making it accessible
  through the Internet in November 1998. And late last year, CATEX
  offered users the ability to set up smaller networks, allowing them
  form groups whose members do business only with one another.

  Since its inception, CATEX has completed about 450 trades,
  totaling $400 million in premium and more than $3 billion in limits,
  he said. CATEX's roughly 160 subscribers include reinsurers,
  insurers and corporate entities that purchase coverage through their
  captives, Mr. Sweeney said.

  ""We obviously have a long way to go, but we are pretty satisfied
  with what we have achieved so far,"" Mr. Sweeney said.

  The exchange sees increased activity after major losses, as cedents
  seek to buy replacement coverage to offset depletions in their
  existing cover, he said. For example, Mr. Sweeney said, there was
  a flurry of activity after the European windstorms in December last
  year.

  Last September, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange entered the field
  of insurance-related derivatives when it began offering weather
  derivatives .

  Thus far, 420 futures contracts have been traded, said Larry
  Grannan, senior director in product marketing at the CME.

  Such contracts are designed to allow businesses to hedge against
  weather-related losses. For example, a utility may sell less power in
  a mild winter, and it would be able to use the futures to hedge a
  resultant fall in revenues.

  The exchange first offered heat-based indexes for Atlanta, Chicago,
  Cincinnati and New York. In January, it added Philadelphia, Dallas,
  Des Moines, Las Vegas, Tucson and Portland, and it began offering
  contracts based on cold weather.

  Currently, most of the trades are between securities dealers
  themselves, but, eventually, the contracts will likely be used more
  extensively by utilities and insurers, Mr. Grannan said.

  In addition, the futures contracts could be used as hedges for
  over-the-counter securitized deals, he said.

Mark:  I have been in touch with Sami Arap who is now Andrea Bertone's boss.  
There are currently two seminars scheduled in Sao Paulo aimed for the 
commercial group and the lawyers as follows:

1.  March 17 - Milbank Tweed  (Securitization)
2.  March 27 - Bracewell (legal issues for contracts)

I think I should attend these and was considering a trip to arrive before the 
start and after the termination of the seminars (approx March 15 - March 
28).  In the interim I could (hopefully) wrap up financial issues with 
Tozzini and address at length physical issues with Tozzini.  Also, I can 
speak with commercial groups and plan a ""swap""seminar for the commercial and 
legal groups (date TBD but probably after the legal seminar in San Antonio).  
Please let me know if the timing works for our group in Houston and if you 
have other thoughts.   Hope all is well.  Sara

Hi there --- Had lunch with Mo today  -- so as you can imagine she was very 
interested in my new role, working with you.  Fernley has decided that it is 
too hard to write down all of the organizational changes and how it affects 
all of the people who reported in to Phillip and I, so he has just verbally 
announced the changes.  But, at any rate, the word is getting out.

I hadn't seen Mo in months, so it was good to catch up.  I think she is 
headed to Houston this week (so is Frank) so I am sure you will be hearing 
from her.


I have tentatively blocked out the week beginning Monday, Nov. 13th to come 
over to Houston, and would like to spend some of that time with you and your 
team, meeting people, and maybe just following you around for the day, as you 
suggested.

Does that week work for you?  I think the Management conference is later in 
the month, so people will generally be around.


Please let me know, and I will make sure it happens.  I will also need to 
spend some time with Melissa Becker and her team working on Post ASE 
Reporting solutions, but will plan to spend a significant amount of time with 
the North America group.


What do you think?  I am ready to get moving on some new things!!!!

 San Diego, CA  92101
 Attention:  Mr. Scott Magie

If asked, I will relay to Scott that the form of the Agreement was based on 
Enron's form utilized in all turbine transaction CA's.

Statement regarding PG&E's securitization agreement:

Enron does not plan to sign PG&E's securitization agreement at this time for 
several reasons.  PG&E has included in the agreement an obligation by 
suppliers to negotiate in good faith to provide additional supplies.  This 
would potentially expand our exposure to PG&E, and there is no way to 
determine that exposure at this time.  PG&E is also asking us to suspend 
certain provisions in our existing agreements that allow us to terminate or 
suspend service in the event of a bankruptcy or failure to pay debts.  This 
limits our flexibility to deal with our different exposures to PG&E.  We are 
continuing to perform on our existing contracts with PG&E.

"CLFP proposes the following changes to medium and large commercial
and industrial customer tariffs for electric service provided by Pacific Gas
and Electric Company and Southern California Edison Company.

 CLFP proposes the Commission establish an optional summer on-peak,
peak period consisting of a continuous 3-hour period during the current
summer on-peak period for both utilities.  The 3-hour period would be
selected by the customer.  Specifically:

 Service Eligibility:  Customers served as medium or large
commercial/industrial customers on time-of-use rates and metered
accordingly.  Examples - PG&E's E-19, E-20, etc. and SCE's TOU-8, etc.

 Customer Eligibility:  Electric customers processing, handling,
distributing or processing perishable food and agriculture products.  (As
noted below, since no revenue shift occurs within the class, the Commission
may consider opening the option to others.)

 Customer Charge Surcharge:  A surcharge of $130 per meter per month
for the initial summer period (2001) to offset the utilities cost for
changes to billing procedures.  In the case of optimal billing period
service customers the surcharge shall correspond with such billing period.

 Optional Summer On-Peak Period:  Any continuous 3-hour period during
the summer-on-peak period of time.  Hours may be designated by the customer
consistent with metering capabilities of the customer or changes to metering
capability.

 The reason for designation by the food processor or agriculture
commodity processing customer is in order to take into account the many
factors involved in load shedding.  Labor, harvesting schedules and
coordination with growers, delivery schedules, inspection activity, etc.
All bear upon such an effort.

 Rate for Optional Summer-On-Peak Period Service:  Energy rates for
the 3-hour period would be two times the otherwise applicable charge for
summer-on-peak energy.  The other 3 hours of the 6-hour on-peak period would
be billed at the non-peak rate and equalized for rate/revenue neutrality.
In the event partial peak periods are retained, the rate for the
non-optioned 3-hour period during the on-peak period would be adjusted to
retain revenue neutrality.  These rates would apply, as now, workdays of
Monday - Friday.

 Notice and Service:  An eligible customer must notify the utility in
writing, by fax, email, or hand delivered, to both the appropriate account
representative and the customer billing department of the request for
optional summer-on-peak period service.  The 3-hour period of optional
service and the start date for such service shall be specified.  Start dates
should coincide with billing cycles, with a minimum of seven days notice
prior to such cycle.  Optional optimal billing period customers would be
treated accordingly, except as currently provided, a two-day advance notice.

 Implementation Issues - TOU Meters and Billing.  It appears the
number of customer meters and billing changes potentially required by
optional summer on-peak period service is relatively small compared to the
total number of meters of the utilities.  

 In response to CLFP's data request by PG&E and SCE (attached) the
following is observed.

 For SCE, SIC 20 (food and kindred products) customers account for
approximately 163 meters out of about 10,000 meters.  Of the 163, all but 8
can be managed locally by the Customer Data Acquisition System.  The 8 would
appear to require a field visit.

 For PG&E, out of 11,675 TOU meters on E-19 and E-20 service, 354 or
3% of the total are SIC 20.  Of the 354 nearly half, 175, are hourly
interval meters.  The remaining 179 presumably would need a field visit for
reprogramming.  

 Conclusion:  Based upon the data supplied, metering and billing
changes required by an optional summer on-peak period program for processors
of perishable commodities, there does not seem, in CLFP's opinion, to be a
significant barrier to establishing the program."

thanks for the note. 

From the European perspective, I think the LC grouping makes sense. I think 
you definitely want Marcus on the call: Marcus will be heading all our non-UK 
European gas and power trading operations and so will be key going forward. 

Query whether you want Jon Chapman on the calls. Jon will not be doing any 
trading work but will doing the European assets work, akin to Bruce's group.

"Sorry for the delay - it's taken me a while to track down the answer to this, 
because Chris Foster, the trader on this deal, is still unclear as to the 
answer. Basically, the deal keeps getting cut by the Cal-ISO, which is why 
Carla goes in and changes the volumes sometimes. But Chris thinks that in the 
end we might not be cutting the deal financially, just physically on a 
day-by-day basis. Given that, we only need the first, original confirm sent 
out - if revised confirms have been sent, let's go ahead and send them the 
original one and leave it at that. 

Chris Foster said he would get back with me this afternoon - he's meeting 
with Real Time and Schedulers right now to sort out this issue.  I apologize 
that this wasn't more clear before. Should I add a note in the comments 
section of this deal to clarify? Or should I just check the deal back to ""no 
confirm""? Let me know.

Thanks,
Kate

"Judy -
I just heard from Kim Hundl in Confirms that you had a discrepancy regarding 
a Short Term West Hourly deal entered for 4/4/01. Deal 570892 was originally 
entered as a buy of 5 MW for hour ending 11. Then the trader extended the 
deal, which is something Real Time traders do often, but when they do they 
rarely modify the deal in EnPower Deal Entry. They simply make the change in 
Scheduling. Because of that, unfortunately, you can only see the true total 
volume of the deal in our scheduling system.

At any rate, I've corrected the Real Time sheet for 4/4 to show the correct 
volumes for the correct hours; and I'm terribly sorry for the confusion. 
Please feel free to call me or e-mail any questions you have regarding EPMI's 
coverage of EES's load. I'm noticing that nine times out of ten, the 
discrepancies originate when Real Time is hurriedly sending spreadsheets to 
you guys and not making sure that they match the deals we have in EnPower. 
Also, I was wondering if you could tell me what database or report you're 
looking at to tie out our deals with your records. I think if I knew more 
about your perspective, I'd be able to help more efficiently.

Attached is the revised Real Time spreadsheet for 4/4. And again, please call 
with questions.

Thanks,
Kate

Subject: invitations to presentation only

Hi Christie,

when do you sleep? 2 am, ugh!

ok,  you were correct, my invitation was to those people within Enron that 
the students talked with before interviewing competitors, and it was an 
invitation to the presentation only.  I didn't think any of them would be 
invited to the dinner, and probably none will even come to the presentation.  
The invitation did elicit one request for the final report though, so maybe 
it wasn't a complete waste.  

I didn't realize that the dinner had turned into a box visit.  that sounds 
great.  I wish the group could have made it to dinner before the first game, 
that would have made the whole slumming experience better.  Now they'll get 
the royal treatment at Enron Field.  It'll be great.

Vince invited 4 people from Rice:

Dennis W. Loughridge, Director of Energy Consortium; lounghrid@rice.edu
Carrie Miller, Director of MBA Program; cmiller@rice.edu
Deborah Barrett, Inst. Communications, barrett@rice.edu
Dr. Wil Uecker, Associate Dean for Executive Education,uecker@rice.edu

Loughridge wrote back saying he'll come, I don't know about the others

Here are the 6 students emails:

""Ritwik \(Ronnie\) Ghosh"" <ghoshr@rice.edu>, ""Ivy Ghose"" <ghosei@rice.edu>, 
""Luigi Calabrese"" <luigical@rice.edu>, ""Pravas Sud"" <pravas@rice.edu>, ""Syed 
\(Farhan\) Iqbal"" <iqbal@rice.edu> 
<cwomack@rice.edu>

your 2 from Rice makes a total of 12 from Rice, I guess

let me know if you would like me to do anything else related to Monday
look forward to seeing you then

"Mary Solmonson, one of my direct reports, has been out of the office since March 1, 2001 and it is not readily known when she will return to work.  All business voice mail messages require a prompt response from our business unit.  Therefore, I am requesting your assistance in completing the following tasks:

1)  Please grant Vanessa Schulte access to Mary Solmonson's voice mail so that she change the access code for retrieving messages so that she can review any incoming voice mail messages and deliver appropriate business responses.  

2)  Please work with Vanessa Schulte on the process of forwarding all incoming calls on Mary Solmonson's line (713-853-6079) to Vanessa's line (x35565) if she so chooses.  She may prefer the ability to check voice mail messages on Mary's line to having Mary's line automatically forwarded to her line.

"Dave,
 Volume, term and price are necessary components of the confirm.  Do not send 
out without these components being in place.  Also, changing from the January 
dates will require additional language changes.  I will make those changes 
when we fill in the rest of the information.  How do we stand on getting the 
final version of the Master Contract drafted and submitted to them for 
signature.  Remember, we need that in place before we do the confirm.,

"I don't know anything about the Daishowa transaction but have to wonder why 
this information could be relevant to much of anything not directly related 
to EnronOnline.  To the extent we can't avoid disclosing it, I would think 
that the traders in Calgary will know how many of them trade using the

Chris, I think Mark is the person to ask, or Mark can refer you to the right

in Canada trade on EOL?  I also assume that this might in fact be a 
confidential matter that should not be disclosed and which should be 
irreleveant to an ICA application for the Daishowa transaction.  In any 
event, why is del Vecchio not dealing with this?

Subject: New CTPY Name - Sierra Pacific Industries

Looks like we might have to modify this name in EnPower after all - The dba 
on our master agreement is ""Sierra Pacific Industries"" with no ""Inc."" at the 
end. I just spoke with Bob Ellery over at Sierra, and he confirmed that, 
although the company is a corporation, they never use ""Inc."" in their 
contracts. Thus, our confirm letters would not match up with the master 
agreement because of those three pesky letters.

Just let me know if this causes a problem for either of you. In case you'd 
like to reference it, the deal number we're attempting to modify is 573679 - 
it's a buy from Sierra done by Chris Foster on the 10th of April. 

Thanks again for all your help.

"This is a thorough and helpful analysis.  But, have we considered the broader 
emergency powers the president might have (i.e. beyond the clean air act 
waivers requested by a governor)?  It would seem that the importance of the 
defense business in California, the large number of military facilities, the 
public safety hazards of widespread blackouts, etc. ought to trigger some 
broader authority.

Subject: Revised Electricity Emergency Authorities Memo



Here's a first draft of the emergency powers memo Sarah put together with 
V&E.  We are still awaiting one more section on the Federal Reserve's 
authority.  As you will note, there is remarkable authority vested in the 
President, including eminent domain.  Please note page 7, which read in 
combination with footnote #4 gives wide authority to the Federal government.  
Let's decide soon how we want to use this memo.  Thanks.

"Greetings Laura and Marybeth:

Laura:
If you have the time and the inclination, I'd like to spend a half-hour 
briefing you on the energy situation.  I apologize for the brevity of this 
note, but can fill you in more if you think that there's value in chatting.

In a nutshell, there's a concerted effort underway----one last big push----to 
try to get a comprehensive solution in place for California that works for 
the majority of constituencies (i.e., broad coalition right and left of 
center).

The deal would be bi-partisan.

If successful, the deal would:

Put rates in place that reflect and cover costs, repay debts, send the right 
price signals for efficiency, but fall short of ""shock therapy.""
Return the utility to creditworthiness as a result of the new rates.
Use the minimum amount of State- and utility-backed bonds to finance the 
solution
Turn the procurement role back over to the utilities (and away from the 
State) once creditworthiness is established---3-6 months following the rate 
changes.
Establish the competitive market structure that California was promised but 
never got---consumer choice for all customers; 18-24 months later, large 
industrial would be required to procure electricity needs from the market.
NOT include government takeovers of the industry (e.g., sale of utility 
transmission assets to the State would not be part of any deal).
Include a contribution from large players, e.g., utilities and suppliers.
Resolve the myriad lawsuits, investigations, etc.

Those involved still believe that there is a need for a group of ""wise 
persons"" to help get the deal done.  L. Summers is willing; others are being 
considered.  Your name has come up.  But that issue can be addressed later.  
The goal of a phone call would be to bring you up to speed on the events, 
which are breaking quickly.

Hope all is well and hope to talk to you soon.  Congratulations on Haas' #7 
ranking in US News and World Report.

Best,
Jeff

Vince,

Attached you will find a draft ""thought document"" based on our
conversations yesterday.  I think that it captures much of my
recollections.  Please edit it to your liking and pass it back to me.  In
the next steps I have laid out a plan of action that should lead us to a
successful conclusion and a draft by Christmas.

Let me emphasize that this is a working document so feel free to modify it
in whatever ways you think appropriate (don't be bashful--I want us to get
this right).

Have a great day.

Your friend,

Roland and I are currently scheduled to arrive in Houston (i.e., the airport) 
next week at 12:30pm on Wednesday and depart at 5:30pm on Thursday.? There 
are lots of flights, so we can certainly come sooner and leave later if that 
is desirable.

I talked to Mike Swartz.? He does understand that he is to ask only questions 
designed to prepare him for depostions of Busse and Nolan of Steel 
Dynamics.?? I told him that he might be asking questions by himself, or he 
might be in with other lawyers.? (He seemed surprised that other lawyers 
might be there.)

If we can work it out, I think it would be best to have Kevin and Brian 
interviewed by Swartz separately rather than with other lawyers.? If Mike is 
in the large group interviews, I fear that we will not, as a practical 
matter, be able to draw the kinds of lines that we would like to.? For 
example, I would just as soon not have Farallon's counsel present when Kevin 
or Brian addresses the questions in Robins, Kaplan's letter of 6/13 that I 
just received.

"Here's how it is shaping up:

We have a fence appointment for noon, the Wednesday before Thanksgiving.  
That is the first opening, but there is always a chance of a cancellation. 
Just in case there is an earlier opening, the utility people will be out 
tomorrow. Therefore, we need to have BOTH dogs put up tomorrow, and the gate 
open.

We have a noon appointment with John Foster THIS Wednesday.  There is a $20 
consulting fee.  This is the same day Michael's class sings in chapel at 115, 
so this isn't too bad.  I have a 130 staff meeting, but maybe I can miss it.  
The work will NOT be done that day, as far as I know.

If we have  a hope of leaving town the week of Thanksgiving, we need a 
reservation at the kennel.  Do we have one yet?  I would say we might want 
one Fri and Sat night. Also, we might want to consider boarding Jack this 
week for a couple of days, so we don't have to do the crate trip.  We should 
be ok Saturday-Wednesday, since I'm planning on being home, and Paige will be 
home on Tuesday.

Davis announces first round of long-term power contracts 
DON THOMPSON, Associated Press Writer
Monday, March 5, 2001 
,2001 Associated Press 
(03-05) 12:31 PST SACRAMENTO (AP) -- The state has reached 40 long-sought 
long-term contracts and other agreements to keep power flowing to customers 
of two financially ailing utilities, Gov. Gray Davis announced Monday. 
The deals will supply an average of nearly 8,900 megawatts per year for 
Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co. customers over 
the next 10 years and let the state buy power for far less than it has been 
paying on the costly spot market, Davis said in a written statement. 
One megawatt is enough power for about 1,000 households. 
For the first five years, the contracts provide power at an average price of 
$79 per megawatt hour, about 75 percent below recent costs on the spot 
electricity market, Davis said. 
The price drops to an average of $61 per megawatt hour, about 80 percent 
below spot prices, he said. 
``These agreements are the bedrock of a long-term energy solution,'' Davis 
said in remarks prepared for delivery Monday afternoon in Los Angeles. ``The 
provide reliability at a reasonable price.'' 
Some of the contract negotiations will result in accelerated power plant 
construction, adding an estimated 5,000 megawatts to the state grid within 
the next two years, some by this summer, Davis said. 
The contracts amount to 75 percent of the long-term deals the Davis 
administration has sought under a new law that lets the state spend an 
estimated $10 billion over a decade to buy power for Edison and PG&E 
customers. 
Davis has pitched such contracts as one way to lift California out of its 
energy crisis. Negotiations have taken longer than expected, however, as his 
administration and power providers haggled over how much the state should 
pay. 
The Davis administration wants to stop paying for power on the expensive spot 
market, where desperation to keep the lights on leads to inflated prices. 
On Friday, the state released another $500 million to continue making such 
purchases on behalf of the state's two big cash-strapped utilities, bringing 
its spending so far to some $3.2 billion since early January. 
The agreements announced Monday include more than 20 power suppliers, 
including electricity giants Duke Energy, Calpine, Dynegy, Enron and Reliant. 
Davis declined to release details on individual contracts. 
Duke Energy said it has reached a $4 billion, nine-year agreement to sell 
electricity to the state. 
The memorandum of understanding calls for Duke to provide 550 megawatts 
starting next Jan. 1. That's enough power for roughly 550,000 households. 
That amount would rise to 800 megawatts Jan. 1, 2003, enough electricity for 
the equivalent of 800,000 households. The contract would continue through 
2010. 
``We believe long-term contracts provide the critical underpinning for a 
stable electricity market and are happy the state is moving in that 
direction,'' Bill Hall, head of Duke's California operations, said in a 
written statement. 
The state is buying about one-third of the power used by the customers of 
Edison and PG&E. Both have been denied credit by suppliers who fear the 
financially troubled utilities won't pay for the power. 
California plans to recover those costs by issuing $10 billion in revenue 
bonds in May, with the rest of that money going to finance the cheaper, 
long-term power contracts. 
In addition to the long-term contracts, the Department of Water Resources has 
reached 11 agreements letting it buy a substantial amount of power on the 
day-ahead market, cutting the state's payment of premium prices on the 
real-time market, Davis said. 
A Stage 1 power alert was called Monday morning with reserves threatening to 
drop to 7 percent due to power plant maintenance and low electricity imports, 
said Patrick Dorinson, spokesman for the Independent System Operator. The ISO 
manages the state's power grid.

Subject: Hedge Effectiveness Test for Fair Value Hedges


Gentlemen:

We have had favorable responses regarding the use of our Volatility
Reduction Method (Roger, I've attached a copy of our article in case you
hadn't seen it).  However, there continued to be a quibble about how to
create the set of data points that would be inputs into the testing process.

Last week the consulting arm of a ""Big Five"" accounting firm indicated that
the following method proposed by us would be acceptable.  We believe this
method overcomes the statistical problems that arise from using interest
rate differences from overlapping (""rolling"") quarters.

Method:

1)Calculate daily yield curve changes expressed as ratios, using historical
rates from the most recent, say, two years. (Note: no overlap).  This
results in a set of around 494 vectors of ratios (approximately 247 trading
days per
year).

Example:
If the first three yield curves in the historical set look like this:
19980801   6.5  6.6  6.7  .........  7.2
19980802   6.3  6.3  6.6  .........  6.9
19980803   6.6  6.8  6.9  .........  7.1

Then the change from 8/1/98 to 8/2/98 is:
6.3/6.5   6.3/6.6   6.6/6.7 .......... 6.9/7.1

And the change from 8/2/98 to 8/3/98 is:
6.6/6.3  6.8/6.3  6.9/6.6  ......... 7.1/6.9

2)Randomly select 62 of these ""ratio"" vectors (approx. 62 trading days in a
quarter).

3)Multiply these ratio vectors together to get a single vector (ie, the 62
6mo ratios are multiplied together, the 62 1yr ratios are multiplied
togeter, etc.).  The result represents a single quarterly yield curve
transformation.  Apply it to ""today's"" yield curve.  The resulting yield
curve represents one simulated quarterly change in interest rates

4)Repeat steps 2 and 3 until an adequate number of yield curves are
generated, say 100.

5) Proceed with testing process.


I would be interested in your comments.

"Further to Mary's memo of 8/18/00, I would like to add the following comments:

(1)  I initially drafted the share swap confirm as a PRICE RETURN swap.  
Scott then requested a TOTAL RETURN swap (ie, dividends included).  I met 
with accounting this morning and (Ryan believes that) the swap is price 
return only:  the asset holder is only swapping price exposure and the 
business unit should recognize the immediate dividend benefit to its asset.

PLEASE VERIFY WHETHER THE SHARE SWAPS ARE PRICE RETURN OR TOTAL RETURN

(2)  With respect to the right of ""multiple optional partial swap 
terminations"", please verify that:
 (a)  the business unit has the right to request that Harrier partially 
terminate the swap prior to the scheduled termination, any number of times, 
without restriction as to frequency, minimum or maximum number of shares, or 
any other limitation, irrespective of whether the asset owner actually sells 
the underlying shares.  How is this right of termination (and the multiple 
requests) to be documented?
 (b)  the ""Initial Price"" of the shares on the Effective Date of the swap 
WILL ALWAYS BE USED to calculate the gain or loss (vs. using the share price 
on the date of each partial termination)"

Vince,

 If you take a cab, ask them to take you to the College of Business
building at the corner of 21st and Speedway.  The main entrance to the
business school is on Speedway, across from the old gymnasium.  Come in the
main entrance, which has a large, glass structure, and you will be on the
second floor.  Go to your left and ride up the first set of escalators to
the third floor.  When you step off of the escalators, you'll be facing
north and continue in that direction through two sets of glass doors into
the northern side of the building.  This is where most faculty offices are
found.  My office is 3.218, which is in the northwest corner of the
building.

 If you have any problems, you should be able to ask directions from
most anyone in the halls.  I will look for you around 11:00 on Thursday, and
will be happy to provide any other transportation that you need.  Please let
me know if you have any other questions.

 Jim

Vince,

     I could pick you up at the airport, or you could rent a car and come
to campus.  I have made tentative plans for us to go to lunch with some
other faculty between 11:30 and 12:00, and then you would have some time to
visit with Sheridan and perhaps with some other faculty members as well
between lunch and my class.

     Sheridan and a guest speaker from his class, Suresh Sundaresan from
Columbia, will be joining us for dinner.  I could provide transportation to
your hotel, and pick you up for dinner as well if you consider that to be
the most convenient alternative.

     I will have a PC available in the classroom, with Office 2000 and
windows NT.  You could use powerpoint with no difficulty from that machine,
if that's most convenient.  You could simply email the presentation, and I
would have it for you if you prefer.

     How much time would you like?  I would like to reserve about 30
minutes at the end for a general discussion of issues related to real
options, and about 30 minutes at the beginning of class for some remarks
regarding the final assignment and a class evaluation by the students
(which
is required for all classes).  At some point, we should take a brief break,
so that would leave approximately 1.5 to 2 hours for your presentation if
you would like that flexibility.  Otherwise, I could take up the ""slack"".

     I look forward to seeing you on Thursday.

     I am traveling at this time, attending a NSF meeting in Washington.
However, I wanted to touch base regarding plans for your presentation in my
class on real options next Thursday (May 4).  As you recall, the class is
from 3:30 to 6:30, and you could plan to take a significant part of that
time for your presentation.  Sheridan Titman has agreed to join us after
his
class at about 6:00 for a 30 minute ""panel discussion"" with the students on

to be your host for dinner on Thursday night if that is convenient for you.

     I'll be back in my office on Monday, and will look forward to

Subject: EOL - Master versus Online GTCs

The underlying contractual structure for trades effected on-line between the 
relevant Enron entity and a Counterparty is as follows:

if there is an existing Master for the particular product between the 
contracting parties, that Master will govern on-line trades.
if there is no Master between the parties, then the applicable on-line GTCs 
will apply. 

If the terms of a Master are unacceptable to us for whatever reason (e.g. due 
to insufficient credit provisions), then it may be appropriate to terminate 
that Master.  
If however, we wish to keep a Master in place but do not wish to use it for 
on-line trades, then the counterparty needs to be notified of this and give 
its consent.  Such notice could state that until the Master had been suitably 
amended (i.e. by the negotiation of new credit provisions), then the on-line 
GTCs will apply.

   Hi there Dutch!

   How are you? Hope you're doing well.

   We having been working on a storage problem that Philip as given us the
   framework for.  In working out the details, we've come across a few
   questions that we know you can help us answer. I've included Philip's
   description of this problem in the word doc below, just for reference.

   1) In Philip's document, he lists discount factors over the months.  We
   understand that since the users are making storage decisions and hedging
   future months, they need to take time value of money into account.  What
   is
   actually being discounted? Is it NYMEX? Is it prices of the instruments?
   How does that factor into user's storage decisions?

   2) In our problem, we ask the user to fill out a storage schedule and
   then
   select instruments to hedge positions created by the storage.  In our
   other
   scenarios we have initial and natural position split out into the Enron
   risk buckets (Price, Index, Basis, GD) and have users choose the
   appropriate hedging instruments based on the risk areas the instruments
   cover.  In this storage scenario, the only positions created are by
   storage
   decisions.  What risk bucket would storage create a position in? My
   thoughts are that if the only positions created are by storage, then
   would
   the user really need only 1 type of instrument to hedge their risks?

   Thanks in advance for your help, Dutch!

"Your recent voice mail message to me indicated that you maintain a list of 
board positions held by VP's and above.  I thought that it might be helpful 
to have this in writing to add to your list.  Beginning with a fiscal year 
that starts April 2001, I am now a member of the Board and President-Elect of 
National Charity League, a mother-daughter community volunteer organization. 

We have over 300 members, including mothers and their daughters in grades 7 
through 12, in the Spring/Champions area.  We run bingo games in local 
nursing homes, provide ""coaching"" during practices for Special Olympics 
volleyball, tennis, track and bowling, stock local food pantries, work with 
children in after-school programs in the local elementary schools, etc.  It 
is a great way to create common goals for mother and daughter teams with a 
focus on others, at a time when girls would otherwise tend to be focused only 
on themselves.  The hope is that this early introduction to volunteerism will 
remain with the girls as a lifelong commitment.  "

Hey Vince,

Thanks for your reply.  I'll see what becomes of the session and keep you
informed.  As to the paper, Tim Crack and I have a revised version of the
paper I gave you.  We have since found out that by using certainty
equivalence, our model is more robust.  For example, if one has an asset
pricing model that incorporates mean, variance, and skewness (Harvey and
Siddique, JF June, 2000) and a binomial model that incorporates mean,
variance, and skewness (Johnson, Paulukiewicz, and Mehta, RQFA, 1997), our
model allows you to price options under the real world measure.  The
benefit is that one can take all of the model parameters from historical
data that is non-risk neutralized.
   From a pricing perspective, there isn't a tremendous benefit in a
mean-variance world (variance stays the same in risk neutral or risky
measure).  However,in the mean-variance-skewness world, there is a benefit
because we do not believe (although we're still hunting down an appropriate
cite) skewness is the same under risk-neutral and risky measure.  Given we
can only measure the skewness in our risky world, our model becomes much
more significant.
   I would certainly appreciate comments on the version of the paper you
have and would also pass on the new version of the paper if you would like
to see it.

Thanks again,

Tom

BN  18:06 Talks Between California, Generators End; No Accord (Correct)

(Corrects lead to say judge recommended FERC hearings to

result disagreements; adds comments from judge in fifth paragraph

and comments from Enron in 13th paragraph.)

 

     Washington, July 9 (Bloomberg) -- A judge who oversaw two

weeks of unsuccessful negotiations aimed at persuading power

sellers to pay refunds in California and other western states

recommended that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission hold

hearings to resolve disagreements within 60 days.

     Two weeks of FERC-ordered talks ended today with the two

sides no closer to an accord.

     ``In 15 days, you can't work miracles,'' said Curtis Wagner,
FERC's chief administrative law judge. ``The numbers were too far

apart.''

      California says it is due a refund of $8.9 billion because

the companies charged excessive prices. Other western states are

also requesting money.

     A group of power sellers offered $510 million to California

during the negotiations, scoffing at the state's method of

calculating the refund, Wagner said. Other parties to the talks

offered about $206 million, bringing the total offer from

generators to $716 million.

      On Saturday, the state brought in analysts who explained how

the state calculated its estimate. He wasn't convinced by

California's arguments that it should receive $8.9 billion, said

Wagner, who wouldn't provide his own estimate of how much should

be paid.

     Wagner said FERC should hold hearings of 60 days or less and

should calculate a refund based on a system it approved for price

caps on June 18. The caps are based on the costs of the highest

priced generator during the early stages of a power shortage.

      That formula should be applied retroactively to Oct. 1,

Wagner said. He wouldn't provide an estimate of the size of such a

refund, saying it would require research into fuel prices from

that time period.

     Michael Kahn, California's chief negotiator, said the judge's

recommendation was a victory for his state. Wagner's formula would

give his state a refund of ``several billion dollars,'' and

California will sue to get the rest, he said.

     ``The judge said we're entitled to our money without

releasing any of our claims,'' Kahn told reporters.

     Generators were mixed on what Wagner's recommendations meant,

though they agreed the state asked for too much.

    ``Under the faulty methodology the state has come up with (to

justify the $8.9 billion refund), we would be owed money because

we bought more than we sold in the spot market in the period in

question,'' said Mark Palmer, a spokesman for Enron Corp, one of

the power sellers taking part in the negotiations. ``That's shows

how ridiculous this is.''

    Houston-based Enron didn't participate in the offer to refund

$510 million, Palmer said, without being more specific.

     ``Nothing I've seen suggests that California cares about a

settlement,'' Palmer said. ``What they care about is shifting

blame. What they care about is a witch hunt.''

     Duke Energy Corp. is ``very pleased'' by the judge's

recommendations, said Brent Bailey, vice president and general

counsel of the Charlotte-based company. The judge's plan fixes

problems with California's methodology for calculating the

refunds, he said.

      California's two biggest utilities have piled up almost $14

billion in debt because of the surging prices that resulted when

the state's plan to deregulate its electricity system failed. The

state began buying power on the utilities' behalf in January and

has spent close to $8 billion.

Subject: Proposed Enron/Petron ISDA documentation

Hi Sara,

How are things with you, m'dear?  Have you any exotic destinations planned 
for this year's vacation?

Anyway - I'm planning to go on vacation with my family (yah - it's weird to 
say ""family"" now!)  to Perth from Thursday 23 September through to Saturday 3 
October and was wondering whether you could help 'babysit' the Petron 
matter.  Janice had mentioned that you'd done some due diligence on ISDA in 
the Philippines a year or so ago so I thought that you would probably be the 
most appropriate person to look after this matter in my absence.  Matt, who 
is a new attorney who joined us in the Singapore office last week, will also 
be keeping track of this file but he hasn't been fully 'Enronized' by Tana as 
yet (tho' he will be so before Thanksgiving as he'll be headed to Houston 
next month for a month's stint there) so I thought it best if you could be 
the main contact person for Petron as well as for our business folks during 
that week that I'm not around.  I really hope that you don't mind.

Assuming that you're OK with this, I would like to give your name and contact 
details to the Enron AP/A/CHI biz folks who are handling this - Manuel 
Gallego in the Philippines, Victor Santos who is presently relocating to 
Singapore and David Terlip to whom they report.  The traders in the Singapore 
office, John Chismar and Eng Wang Moi , will be providing the pricing.  Matt 
and my assistant, Angeline, will get hold of you should they hear from Petron 
during that week.  The plan is that Petron is interested in entering into 
some crack spread swaps with us.  So far, Citibank and Chase have signed up 
ISDAs with Petron.

In the meantime, I'll have Angeline fax to you copies of all the 
correspondence which I've had had with our Filipino counsel QTE to-date so 
that you'll get a good idea of what the regulatory and legal environment's 
like now in the Philippines. [Angeline - can you please do that today.  
Sara's fax no. is Houston Legal's fax no.]

So far, QTE has reviewed our draft ISDA Schedule and Credit Support Annex and 
I sent it across to Petron's inhouse counsel on 8 September (please see 
attached) and I'm now waiting for their written comments on those drafts.  

Please let me know whether you'll be able to look after this matter for me.  
Looking forward to hearing from you.

Thanks a mill,
Anita

 discussed, the Wine Society of Texas is a statewide 501(c)3
 educational organization with approximately 350 members in Texas
 and about 120 in Houston. We also have chapters in Austin, San
 Antonio and two in the DFW area. Our mission statement
 (paraphrased and shortened) is to help develop a wine educated
 consummer base in Texas and to support charitable organizations
 and responsible consumption. Unfortunately, some people confuse
 this message with only working with or interest in Texas wines. But,
 this is far from the truth.

 The WST has been working to provide education on wine tasting,
 wine making and grape growing in a pleasant social setting. The link
 to the local wine industry has been a great asset that has helped
 provide first hand experiences in grape growing and wine making.
 Personally, I have picked and crushed and this has given me have a
 much better appreciation for this part of the process everytime I
 down a glass of wine. However, we have also been trying develop an
 awareness in Texas regarding the benchmarks in fine wines, so that
 consummers increase their knowledge of fine wines from around the
 world.

 This latter point is one that is illustrated in our upcoming event,
 Springfest 2000, on March 24-26. The festival event will be held in
 Old Town Spring Texas and the premium events (Vintner Dinner and
 Grand Tasting) will be held at the Hotel Sofitel near Bush IAH.  We
 will have specialists in grape growing and wine making talking about
 new varietals in Texas, some of which have their ""roots"" in other
 similar regions of the world such as those from Rhone, Spain and
 Italy. We also the Art Institute Culinary School their to give wine and
 food preparation demos. Our Vintner Dinner (Fri. 3/24) will feature a
 special pairing of wines from Texas and France featuring
 Chardonnay and Rhone Blends.  At the Grand Tasting and Media
 Choice Awards Presentations, (Sat. 3/25) the attendees will be
 tasting the best of the wine submitted for judging and vote for their
 favorites. Springfest is a charity event that is raising funds for the
 American Heart Assocition, the Old Town Spring Preservation
 League and the Wine Society of Texas Scholarship Fund. More
 details are available at:

 http://www.winesocietyoftexas.org/houston/

I welcome you and your members to
 check out the WST and Springest 2000. If you have any questions,
or would like more information, please contact me.

Regards,

Dr. R.D. Kane
Co-Chair Houston Chapter & Vice President

Ben,

What are these folks supposed to do for Enron?  I had heard a rumor that we 
were looking to hire someone to lobby for us on a success fee basis.  Is this 
the same deal?  I know on the international side there were hoops to jump 
through before such an engagement could be signed off on.  I'll have to check 
to see what the drill is on this side of the street.

As discussed in Fort Pierce, Tripp Scott is that insurance policy I've been 
looking for to help secure the commission vote in Pompano.  Tripp Scott will 
also assist us in our door knock campaign in the County & Tallahassee.  
Pozzuoli is a mover & shaker and is on a first name basis with Jeb Bush -  he 
was the Chairman for the Bush/Cheny Broward County re-count.

Bill Keith & Debbie Orshefsky highly recommends the engagement.

The only people that can have full view and edit capability are Legal and 
Credit (for legal/client confidentiality purposes).  Attached is the icon, 
which is just a shortcut link to the database and you can send that link to 
any Enron employee and they will have view access to all the information in 
the database except the legal and credit comments.  I will make a request to 
add the legal and credit people to get edit capability.  I think Denis 
O'Connell already had edit access, send him the link and let me know if he 
has edit access.  (you can just copy this link and add it to emails to 
people, however, I'm a little afraid it might not work from London, because 
it is just a shortcut, if it doesn't, you might need your computer people to 
create a shortcut link for y'all, let me know).

Subject: Re: Mark-to-Market  

Sandeep:
 I met with Bob today and discussed the deal structure we put together. On 
the mark-to-market issue, Bob and his colleague Wess told me that as long as 
payments are tied to one particular plant, we cannot m-t-m them. They had 
same problem with plants here in the US (like the peaking plants) and they 
had to separate the plant from power sales to be able to m-t-m the assocated 
cashflows.  What they did is: they sold power from the plant to an outside 
party and bought it back from them at completely different (multiple) 
locations. The buyback is not tied to any specific plant and is marked to 
maket. Even if Enron can somehow mark-to-market a deal with DPC, it can do so 
for only 50% of the cashflows because only 50% of DPC is owned by outsiders.  
And a simple loan to an affiliate cannot also be marked to market.

 Bob was suggesting that if EIPL buys options from DPC and from some other 
plants and in turn sells power to AP or Karnataka then we could have a case 
for m-t-m. Politically DPC selling power to EIPL may not be the best 
solution, to put it rather mildly!

Our alternatives, as I see them, are
1. Do the deal as we structured it. The only difference is that Enron doesn't 
mark it to market and income is      earned only in 2002-03.
2. Do the deal as we structured it. EIPL/Enron then sells the contract to 
another party at a profit. The problem, of course, is finding this party and 
forking part of the profit to them. 
3. Same deal, except revenue securitization is done through an outside party 
in India (not EIPL).

Bob said he will think about the issues some more this week. Let me know when 
you will be here next week so we can meet with Bob together. I will be going 
to Boston for Tuesday and/or Wednesday (Feb.1-2). I can book an appt. with 
Bob for us.

Subject: Mark-to-Market

Bob,

I wanted to continue the analysis on mark-to-market that I had spoken to you 
about on the phone.  

I thought that it was getting very difficult explaining the whole transaction 
by phone, so I am having Krishnarao who is in Vince's group explain the 
transaction to you.

Krishna has been helping us structure the deal here in India, and he has just 
returned to Houston from India after working with the team here.

He will seek an appointment with you to explain the transaction.  I would 
like you to please spend some time with him, and then based on the discussion 
please send us a note detailing how sucha a transaction would be marked to 
market.

Please cosider the fact that currently there are no such transactions from 
the Indian side.  This is a very important transaction for us, and we may 
need to repeat this in coming months, hence setting up the system to account 
for these maybe well worth it.  Also, what I am concerned about is that there 
will be an Enron India (EIPL) account in India based on Indian GAAP, and upon 
consolidation there will be a US GAAP accounting in the US.  It is here that 
we would like to have mark-to-market accounting.  EIPL is structured through 
Mauritius, and then Caymen Islands.

Another key question to consider is that when we m-t-m the transaction in the 
US there will be a tax accruing in the year of m-t-m (say 2000).  However, in 
India, as a result of the accrual accounting, there will not be any income 
showing till the year 2002 or 2003.  We will need to know how that would get 
treated, and whether there is a way to get credit for the tax payable in the 
US.  I am also confused about whether US tax would be levied, since none of 
the income is being brought back into the US (remains overseas - subpart-F 
and other concerns).

Finally, we have been working hard in structuring a fixed price contract and 
getting a fixed for floating swap in the US (this is still not allowed to 
Indian Corporates).  I need you to think about this too, and see if some type 
of accounting will solve this issue.  Krishna knows what I am talking about, 
and will brief you on the same.

Krishna - Please walk Bob through the three structures we had worked here.

Look forward to your help and comments.  This is going to be an exciting 
project for us all.

Regards,
Sandeep.

Here is a draft of a letter agreement amending the online Electronic Trading 
Agreement.  Please let me know if it is ok and I will have a copy executed

My apologies for the delay - I thought I had sent this to you last week but I 
can't find any record of it so I must not have done it.

Hi.

I hope you got my message. Rob (if you don't know) has been ""swiped"" by Risk
to edit one of the new newsletters - Risk Management Operations - and so no
longer works with Books. We were very sad to see him go, but it is a great
opportunity for him and nice to see some intelligent internal promotion for
a change! Was there anything in particular you needed, Vince? Just to say
also that the energy titles (especially MEPR2) have received some excellent
reviews at contingencyanalysis.com which may interest you. Rob may have
mentionned the Utility Risk title we'd like to publish next year; any views
on that from you would be welcome, obviously. Let me know if and when you're
around and we can catch a coffee.

In the meantime, I hope you and your family have some good quality holiday
time. Best regards, as always. Sh?n

"Hey, I'm right there with ya, sister. As far as feeling out of place in a new 
city, it's totally normal. That's how I felt about Maui the entire time I was 
there. I kept thinking I was just picky, weird, anti-social or otherwise 
mentally unstable because I just didn't feel right there. I kept ""sticking it 
out another month"" because I thought, eventually, the majestic wonders and 
buff tanned men would win me over and I would spend the rest of my days 
frolicking along the white sand, swinging from jungle branches and blissfully 
speaking pidgin. But it just never clicked. I don't really know why; all I 
can surmise is that the lure of familiarity and home is much stronger than we 
know, or would like to know.

It's definitely good to get out of your comfort zone and experience something 
new every once in awhile (Lord knows that's my modus operandus), but I think 
you'll know if Denver is really ""your kind of town."" In the meantime, just 
take it for what it is - a fun place to be a young, swingin' single. It'll 
take more than a month to adjust and meet people; and even then you might not 
meet the kind of people you're ultimately looking for. Sorry to sound so 
pessimistic - I'm really not - maybe I'll just employ my favorite analogy to 
explain: when you walk into Mimi & Lena, or Fred Segal, or even Nordstrom, 
and you start perusing the racks, how long does it take you to decide whether 
or not you like a shirt or a pair of boots or something? A minute. Seconds, 
maybe. But you don't have to camp out in the store for several hours or days, 
just hanging out with your skirt of choice, to decide if you want to take it 
home with you. Granted, this is a mere item of clothing as compared with a 
habitat, but you get the picture.

Which leads me to my next point - men. Same goes for them. If there are 
characteristics about this guy you find make your skin crawl, it doesn't 
matter if he's Tom Cruise with the mind of Einstein and the social graces 
of....well...some guy with social graces, IT WILL NOT WORK! Run - don't walk 
- away from a situation like this. I have just one word to describe to you 
what can happen with guys like this - BRIAN. He was sooo sweet, soooo smart, 
soooo in love with me, and even tolerable to look at. But soon the walls came 
crumbling down and the level of his cheesiness, which was mild to begin with, 
escalated as he felt me pulling away. It all ended in that debacle we know as 
""Brian's Trip to Portland."" It was hauntingly uncomfortable, and all I can 
tell you is, nobody could have warned me. I was blinded by something akin to 
love, but much more akin to an ego-trip, which was what I was on everyday 
with him because he pretty much thought I was God's gift and made sure I knew 
it.....constantly. 

Listen, I have to go, and I've said my piece for the day. I'll try and give 
you a call tonight and we can theorize further on the subject. When you 
really get down to it, you're doing great - exactly what anyone and everyone 
at your age, and mine, is doing - which is basically wondering what the hell 
to do with the rest of our lives. And meanwhile ""the rest of our lives"" are 
slipping past unnoticed. Just remember the John Lennonn quote, ""Life is what 
happens when you're busy making other plans."" Now THERE's a real man. Whoa.

Love,
Kate"

Rod:
I found my file and here is where things stand:

1. On cross default threshold, they wanted it to be the same as the 
collateral threshold but my notes indicate that they were okay leaving it at 
$100,000.

2. In lieu of receiving financials from them, we had agreed to accept 
quarterly and annual Lease Operating Statements.  Did I use the correct 
term?  Do we need a definition for this or is it understood what these 
statements are?  I am also assuming that they are internally prepared.  Is 
that correct?  My notes indicate that these would be provided within 90 days 
after quarter end.

3. We agreed to a collateral threshold for them of $500,000.

4.  For the MAC trigger, is the only test the Net Cash Flow/Revenue test and 
if so, what would trigger the MAC?  Are there other triggers?  We used to 
have Funded Debt/Partners Capital, EBITDA Coverage Ratio and Minimum Partners 
Capital tests.  Alos, here are my proposed definitions:

Cash Flow means Net Income plus depreciation and non-cash charges minus 
capital expenditures as shown on the income statement.

Net Income means gross revenues and other proper income credits, less all 
proper income charges, including taxes on income.

Revenue is cash received from the sale of oil, gas and plant products. 

Should there be references to the Lease Operating Statements in these 
definitions?

5. All Performance Assurance would be rounded up to multiples of $10,000.

This is all that I have.  Let me know what you think.

Carol St Clair has confirmed for me that the GTC does not contemplate a

'flagged' by the ISO with 75 minutes of publication and must be changed 
within 5 days. Since the GTC doesn't contemplate the issue and the mechanism

as we should contemplate this issue in the Long Description.

Subject: US East Power Financial Swaps

The East Power traders would like to commence transacting on financial swaps. 
We had anticipated this, so the Product Type was already built and has been 
approved. The Index and Loadshape built with this Product were done so based 
on comments from John Suarez (the trader), who has approved the attached.

Leslie - please offer commets/suggestions from the power perspective.

Mark - final approval will need to come from you since this is a financial 
product.

Also, trading wants us to consider price changes for the Product because the 
prices published do change from time to time. I know that the ISDA 
Definitions contemplate a 30-day true-up, but I can't find a like provision 
in the GTC. So - I took a hack at some language to contemplate the issue:

""If the price published (as set forth herein) on any day during a 
Determination Period is subsequently corrected and the correction is 
announced within 30 calendar days of the original publication date, the 
parties agree that the corrected price shall take affect as if it were the 
price published on the original publication date and the Floating Price will 
be adjusted accordingly. Payments of the adjusted Floating Amount will take 
place 5 business days following notification by either party of a change to a 
published price.""

We can close the loop on our commitment to support the research projects
before your visit to Enron.

My assistant, Shirley  Crenshaw, will call you to set up a conference call 
with me, Stinson Gibner,
and Tom Gros from Enron Broadband Services to discuss all the isssues. Friday 
this week would work for 
both Tom and me. I think we need about 15 minutes.

Subject: Visit to Enron



Hello Vince,

It was nice seeing you at Stanford and many thanks for the lunch
we had together. I really enjoyed our discussions, both at the
technical level and otherwise.

I promised to send you an e-mail regarding possible dates for
a visit to Enron. I delayed it for a week till my schedule was
clearer. Let's see if we can get a match with your schedule -
mine is rather terrible:

Friday, 21st of April looks good. But April 23rd is Easter
Sunday, so that may make it difficult for some people at Enron
to be around. Let me know if that is the case. I am willing to
visit then, because the week after that I am scheduled to be in
Japan and in the previous weeks I am all committed on Fridays.

Friday, 19th of May is the next possibility, but this probably
is too far out. The main problem is that I am operating within
a window of opportunity for attracting top students for this
research. This window closes by the end of April, and it would be
important for the student support funds to be in place then, so
that I can make hard commitments to students and attract top
talent. I am already reviewing files of students who have
approached me for PhD advising, and I am in a mode of doing ""soft
commitments to star-level students"" to get this research and its
potential on their radar screen. Top students are highly sought
after by advisors and I want to be an early player in this
competition.

Does my visit to Enron have to happen before we can set up the
project and student support at Stanford? If so, doing it before the
end of April is important for getting top people. If the visit can
happen after we get the ball rolling, then we can schedule it in May.
I assume there will be multiple visits both ways when the project gets
going. Please let me know what you think.

Best Regards,

Nick

"We expect to have a change order executed by ABB on Monday (Tuesday at the 
latest) whereby we agree to pay all but the retainage amount, and they 
acknowledge that we can assign it to WHOEVER, including the agent (right?).

Ben and I discussed the fact that the Coral turbines will be moved into 
TurboPark.  I believe we will want to assign the turbines to an Enron LLC the 
following week. FYI, we have a conference call tomorrow to finish the binding 
agreement to see them the turbines.  If it would work to keep them in WestLB, 
that's great. However, I want to do whatever creates the least amount of 
stress for you two.  I'll manage Coral and Ben.  Please advise.

Sara:
 Thanks for your note and sorry that I haven't called recently.  I have 
joined some day time tennis leagues at our club and between that, Charles, 
Arthur etc.  life has been fairly hectic.  I keep trying to pick a good day 
to come up to the office, but so far have not found a day that works for both 
Bill and I but hopefully I'll see everyone soon.  By the way, you and anyone 
else in the group are always welcome to come out here!!  I know that it is 
far and that you all are busy but feel free to plan something if you want.

How are the legal assistant's and the rest of the group?  How are you doing?  
I must say that I am enjoying my time away from the office.  Charles is doing 
great.  He is now 13 pounds, 6 ounces and allot 23 inches.  He is growing 
like a weed and eats often which keeps me busy round the clock although he 
has started to sleep some more at night.  We are slowly but surely getting 
into a routine with him and I feel blessed to have Bill here to help.  It's 
hard to believe that 2 months has already gone by!  Time flies when you are 
having fun.

Anyway, hang in there and keep me posted.  Say hi to Mike for me and if he 
ever wants to play some tennis, please call us.

All,

Attached is the 11/30/01 file which is probably the best information we have.  I have screened it so that it only includes those counterparties with financial mark to market exposure.  Additionally, I screened out all Enron entities except for ENA, ECC, and EPMI.  While I cannot guaranty that the data is completely accurate, it should give you the starting point you need to proceed with processing/prioritizing financial terminations.  Obviously, the values will be different from what is specified here based on the Termination Date specified by each counterparty.

 Yesterday we entered into a trade with CSFB for the block sale of our shares of common stock of Catalytica, a public company.  The shares are held in JSB Asset LLC. We now have to set up an account with CSFB on behalf of JSB Asset, LLC to consummate  the sale of our shares in Catalytica.  PLease note that the trade occurred yesterday so we are now in documentation stage.  We will most likely terminate the account immediately upon conclusion of the transaction.

 Brenda and Joel--any problems with us setting up an account with CSFB for JSB Asset LLC?

Also note that I ran this by our internal and external counsel handling the investigations and these transactions in Catalytica do not create any issues relevant to the investigation.

DRAFT DRAFT DRAFT




Harvey Morris Esq.
California Public Utilities Commission
505 Public Utilities Commission
San Francisco, California   94102

  Re:   I.00-08-002  Subpoenas Served on Enron Power
Marketing, Inc. (""EPMI""), Enron Energy Services Operations Inc. and Enron
Energy Services Inc. (collectively referred to as ""EES""), Enron Energy
Marketing Corporation (""EEMC""), and Portland General Electric Corporation
(""Portland General"")(collectively sometimes referred to as the ""Enron
Entities"")

Harvey,

 Here are our proposals with respect to the Enron Entities'
production of documents pursuant to the above described subpoenas issued by
the California Public Utility Commission (hereinafter ""the Commission"").
The Enron Entities are willing to assist the Commission in undertaking its
investigation into the problems in the California electric markets by
producing the information specified on a timely basis.  We believe that the
limited production we propose will enable the Commission to commence its
investigation much sooner than if the parties were forced to litigate all of
the potential objections to the requests for production, which are, by any
standard, extremely broad and could involve millions of pages of documents.
We make these proposals pursuant to our email exchange of October 3, 2000
with the understanding that the Commission agrees that by cooperating,
offering to produce or producing documents, the Enron Entities have not
waived any objections or challenges to these subpoenas whatsoever and that
any claims, defenses, objections, jurisdictional or otherwise or other
responses have been specifically reserved and can be raised in the future,
if necessary.   For all of these proposals, we exclude documents that are
protected from disclosure by the attorney client and attorney work product
privileges.

 Generally speaking, the Enron Entities propose to produce documents
for year 2000 as noted below.  We also understand that the Commission will
be obtaining documents from the ISO and PX and we will not attempt here to
duplicate documents that we understand will be produced by those entities.
As you will see in the general documents that are offered here for
production, Enron Energy Services Operations, Inc. is the parent of Enron
Energy Services, Inc. and does not have operating authority or engage in
wholesale or retail purchases or sales of energy.  Thus, the documents
offered here with respect to those two entities originates with Enron Energy
Services, Inc. but we have designated them both as EES.  We also do not
propose to offer duplicative documents as between the Enron Entities.

GENERAL DOCUMENTS
Requests 1 through 4

 Because of the dynamic nature of the Enron Entities' businesses, the
burden and expense on them to locate, and produce every corporate
organizational chart anywhere in their organizations since April 1, 1998 is
significant.   The Enron Entities will provide the Commission with exemplars
of their current organizational charts, telephone directories and so called
""family trees"" to show its current organization.  To the extent that the
Enron Entities can readily identify and locate exemplars of significant
organizational charts, telephone directories or so called ""family trees"" for
earlier periods they will also make those available.  One Enron Entity,
Portland General, has published books on its corporate history.  If a list
of those books would be helpful, we can provide it.  With respect to the
other Enron Entities, to the extent that corporate histories can be found,
they will be produced.  We anticipate producing these documents in the first
wave on October 13, 2000.

Requests 5 and 6

 The Enron Entities propose that their responses to Requests 1-4 will
identify their relationship to affiliated companies and the Transaction
Documents will identify its customers and suppliers.  We believe this
information will be sufficient to illustrate these relationships for the
staff's purposes.

FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS
Requests 7 through 11

 The Enron Entities will produce their public filings for the period
requested with respect to financial data.  EPMI, EES, and Portland General
will provide to the Commission electronic transaction data ( the
""Transaction Documents"") for the purchase and sale of energy delivered which
information includes economic data.   We anticipate producing public filings
regarding financial data on October 13, 2000 and the electronic Transaction
Documents in the second wave of document productions.

GENERATING DOCUMENTS
Requests 12, 14 and 18

 For the Enron Entities other than Portland General, the generation
facilities are either non-existent or limited in number and there will
probably be limited documents available.  The Enron Entities to the extent
they act as a scheduling coordinator or possessed the right to use or resell
generation output, do not have the specific documents that pertain to each
generation unit requested.  The Enron Entities, other than Portland General,
do have documents and information for Las Vegas Cogeneration.  We propose to
produce these documents in the second wave of document productions.

  For Portland General, the production of the requested documents
would involve a tremendous volume of documents, as Portland General owned
twenty generating facilities of a variety of types and sizes during 2000.
Portland General is a net importer of energy and can only generate about one
half of its total energy demand.  As a result, we question whether the
effort required of Portland General is warranted as its impact on the
California wholesale market is necessarily limited.  In addition, those
transactions which do involve Portland General sales into California are
limited to sales to the ISO and PX, and long term contracts with two small
California municipal utilities.  Thus, the Commission will receive the
essential transactional information regarding these sales from the ISO and
PX.  Nevertheless, Portland General proposes to provide for year 2000
electronic Transaction Documents in summary form similar to the data being
provided by other Enron Entities, to the extent relevant as discussed below.
We propose that the Commission defer requesting production of other
information until it has reviewed the information of generators who sell a
significant proportion of their energy into the California market.  At that
time a more accurate assessment can be made of whether this enormous effort
will be valuable given the limited impact of Portland General generation on
the California wholesale market.

TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS
Requests 13, 15, 16, 17 and 19

 We understand that the Commission will be obtaining trading data for
the purchase and sale of energy delivered in California from the ISO and PX.
EPMI can provide the Commission several different sets of relevant
transaction data for year 2000 (in California and outside of California and
Real Time) for the purchase and sale of energy delivered with the date,
counterparty, quantity, delivery point, hours, price, and whether it is a
purchase or a sale.   Because of the speed with which you want this
information, it is possible that some entries will be incomplete or
inaccurate.  For those
transactions where EPMI served only as the scheduling coordinator, we
understand that the ISO will show part of the transaction, but there will
not be a corresponding transaction in the EPMI data we can provide quickly.
The reason is that this type of transaction is passed through to EPMI's
customer on an accounting system rather than as part of the trading
business.  EES can also provide similar data with respect to relevant
wholesale and retail transactions with the proviso that with respect to
retail transactions it will not include the specific names of its retail
customers but instead will provide a blind customer number due to EES'
confidentiality obligations to those customers.  We anticipate producing the
Transaction Documents in the second wave of document productions.

FERC DOCUMENTS

Request 20

 The Enron Entities will produce the requests for data they received
from FERC and to the extent that FERC has been given responses, copies of
those responses.  We anticipate producing the FERC documents on October 13,
2000.


 Based upon discussions that we have had with the various Enron
Entities, we believe that we could make a second wave of productions on
Friday October 27, 2000.  It is possible that not all Enron Entities could
make that date but we believe the bulk of the data could be available for
production by then.

 We propose to make these productions with the understanding that if
any entity obtains a more stringent protective order than the one currently
in place, that all of the Enron Entities document productions will be
protected by the most stringent protective order.  In addition, if, at the
request of any party or nonparty to this proceeding, the Commission or a
court of competent jurisdiction orders that the requests for production be
limited, reduced or eliminated, the Enron Entities reserve the right to
limit the production of documents in conformance with such order.

 We understand that you will consider these proposals and let us know
if they are acceptable to the Commission.  If you have any questions or
comments about our proposal, please do not hesitate to contact Michael Day
or myself.

"Folks:

My apologies in advance if I vent somewhat.  

Briefly, some of you know that I attended Berkeley's Policy School.  I have 
been very closely involved with the conference Severin describes in his note 
to Littlechild.  I have been working to try to establish a joint venture 
between the policy and business schools at Berkeley to hold an ""energy 
summit,"" where national and international energy leaders would converge on 
California (under the auspices of UC Berkeley) to talk energy policy.  Jim 
Steffes has helped a lot in brainstorming the idea.  In short,, our goal was 
to have a group of prominent folks squarely refute the extremely retrograde 
notions of ""turn the clock back"" that the Governor of California's two most 
recent appointees have been articulating at every opportunity over the past 
several months, and re-seize the agenda in California. The ""energy heads of 
state"" at the summit would come up with solutions for going forward.

The concept (and invitees) that Severin describes is loosely based on 
proposals I have made to the ""steering committee.""  However, for reasons I 
won't bore you with in this note, the effort has frankly turned into a 
fiasco.  I notified the group this week that Enron would not be 
participating, that they should go forward with the conference without us, 
and that I would help somewhat (contacts, etc.) when (and if) they ever came 
to agreement on the agenda and particpants.  From my perspective, the effort 
turned out to be a rather big disappointment.  I urge us not to get involved 
or contribute $$s.  At this juncture I would recommend against having Ken Lay 
participate.  Depending on how the thing shapes up, we may  or may not want 
to have someone at a substantially lower level participate, but I'm 
pessimistic at this point.  If anyone would like to discuss my reasons in 
more detail, I'd be happy to discuss.

I still think the idea of an energy summit is very promising.  But the forum 
that these folks are creating ain't the right one.

Best,
Jeff

Please see Professor Littlechild's note to our former Deputy Chairman for 
Enron Europe, Ralph Hodge.  Ralph is no longer with us.  Let me know if you 
would like to support ($$) Littlechild coming to California.  He was a 
somewhat passive regulator (too academic), but is a credible authority, 
having written what is regarded as one of the seminal works on incentive 
regulation, which is the model in use in the UK.   He likes Enron, and has 
been trying to get us to pay him for some work for some time.  No need for it 
here in the UK, but I would use him in emerging markets given the 
opportunity.  Let me have your thoughts at your earliest convenience.

Dear Ralph
?
I have just written a?paper on retail  competition in electricity, arguing 
that Joskow, Hogan and Ruff, and California,  have got it all wrong, both in 
theory and in practice.? It is forthcoming  shortly in the DAE and Judge 
Institute working paper  series at Cambridge, but I thought you might like to 
see a copy now  (attached).
?
This is obviously a hot issue in California at  present, and this morning I 
received an invitation to  participate?in a debate there in November  (copy 
forwarded separately). It seems that Enron is also to be invited. I have  no 
other commitments in the US at that time.? Is is something that Enron  might 
be interested in supporting, or for that matter developing  further?
?
We spoke some time ago about the Common Carriage  Consultative Working Group 
at Ofwat. I did in fact aprticipate in that, along  with Kyran Hanks. It was 
a real eye-opener, to see how little awareness there  was of the basic 
conditions conducive to competition, like separate businesses  and accounts.? 
I'm not sure whether Enron is pursuing this now or not. No  doubt lots of 
other things going on.
?
I should be interested to hear from you on retail  competition.? I am copying 
this to Mark Schroeder and Kyran.
?
With regards
?

couple of really cute pictures of your kids and mom and dad, so if it's okay
with you I would like to get some copies made for me to keep before I mail
the roll to you. Is that okay?

There are a couple of really cute picures of Paige carrying Michael piggy
back!

Take it easy!

Love you!

I will be having about 5-7 other people that I will need added to this 
database.  Should I send these requests back directly to you, or do them 
through the system as well?

Also, there are two ways of getting edit access through this database.  One 
is for employees of Legal, who can then enter Legal comments, and the other 
is for employees of Credit, who can then enter Credit comments.  Do you see 
that choice?  Is there some way for me to verify which employees of Legal and 
which employees of Credit have what access?  I know that some employees of 
Credit have Legal access by mistake.  Can I get lists of the Legal and Credit 
breakdowns?

"Suzanne:
Sorry I didn't call you last weekend.  How's everything at the office?  Is 
Julia back yet?  I wrote her a card and I hope that over the next few weeks 
and months she can grieve and at the same time get on with her life.  I 
really feel for her.  Keep me posted on how she's doing?  What have you and 
Ric been up to?  Charles and Arthur are doing great.  Bill's mom is here for 
a visit and we are having alot of fun.   I had lunch with Kristina last week 
and she updated me on the ""Enron"" happenings.  Seems like every week there is 
a major organizational announcement.  Where do you think Scott Sefton will 
end up?  She seemed to thing that he might take the compensation package that 
apparently was offerred to him.  It was good to talk to her and get back in 
touch with work.  I'm still playing alot of tennis and really enjoying it.  
Charles is now old enough for the daycare that our tennis club provides so 
Bill and I go out there quite a bit in the morning to hit which is nice.  i 
still don't know what my long range plans are and will probably start 
discussing with Bill what to do in the next few weeks.  It's hard to believe 
that I have been out for over 3 months.  time really does fly by.  

Give my best to everyone and write back when you can.  Did Stacy have her 
baby yet?

I spoke w/ Steve Hamilton (Pres/CEO) about co-signing the letter and although

if JB somehow pulls together the money to take us out, he will be

Ken Lay put a call in today to Scott McNealy.  His office called back to find 
out what specific bill included direct access.  When I called back, they put 
me in touch with Mavis Toscano, who's in Sun Microsystems' state and local 
government affairs office.  She's Scott's point person on public policy, and 
she's been working on the energy issue.  Mavis had done some checking and no 
one had heard anything about direct access.

Sun is active in three main trade associations: the Chamber, the American 
Electronics Association (AEA) and Technet.  None of those organizations said 
their members were asking for direct access, but Mavis promised to put calls 
in to them and get direct access on the radar screen.  Although she said 
they're not inclined to send letters, Mavis said she'd make some calls into 
the legislators, specifically Bowen.

"The Emmisions book under Kevin McGowan will take a one time $4 Million hit 
today.  This is to move the curves to better reflect the current market.  
This hit will stay in the Coal group but will be removed from its P/L from a 
performance measurement standpoint.  Now that the curves are corrected I 
expect a focus on building our emmisions trading business in the following 
ways:

1.  Understanding the fundamentals.
2.  Taking advantage of structural shifts that we forecast.
3.  Building more liquidity and being the primary market maker.
4.  Developing new traders.

		CPUC PRESIDENT LYNCH AND COMMISSIONER DUQUE STATEMENT 
		California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) President Loretta Lynch and 
Commissioner Henry Duque today issued a statement regarding revisions to item 
8 on the Commissioner agenda of December 21, 2000:
		We note certain revisions to the Commission's published agenda for December 
21st. Item 8 has been revised to reflect the scope of options available to 
the Commission in addressing current financial conditions facing Pacific Gas 
and Electric and Southern California Edison. The financial problems faced by 
California's utilities are the result of the failure of the wholesale 
electric market to ensure just and reasonable prices for this necessity. The 
Commission need not act on this agenda item on December 21st, but the fact 
that it is on our agenda allows the Commission to act if necessary. 
		The financial stability of California's utilities is of paramount importance 
to California, and to this Commission. The CPUC stands ready to act to 
protect the financial viability of California utilities. The exorbitant and 
unjustified prices now being charged in California's electricity market 
demonstrate the necessity for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) 
to intervene and control the opportunism of the electricity sellers. FERC 
must act to solve the underlying market failure so that all energy consumers 
are assured of reliable delivery of power and protected from exorbitant 
energy costs. We urge FERC to act immediately. 
		For information on this item, please contact Harriett Burt, Deputy Chief of 
Staff for Loretta Lynch at 415-703- 2444, Mary Lou Tousey, 415-703-2593, or 
Commissioner Carl Wood, 415-703- 2440.

"As presently drafted the ETA provides that if a master agreement is in force 
covering a particular transaction, the master controls.  I don't think we 
ever adequately resolved the multiple Enron entity issue, though.  For 
example, if a counterparty has an ISDA Master Agreement in place with ENA, 
that master agreement could easily cover a trade based on UK gas prices.  
However, it is not the commercial people's intent that the system work that 
way.  They want every trade for a particular product to be with a single 
Enron entity (e.g. all UK gas transactions are with Enron Europe), regardless 
of what master agreements are in place.  To resolve this I suggest that the 
long descriptions be revised to state the Enron trading entity for each 
product type (this is already in place for European derivatives) and that the 
ETA be revised as follows:

revise the fifth line of paragraph (a) of Section 3 such that Transactions 
are governed by the short and long definitions in respect of a product 
""...and any master agreement between Counterparty and the Enron entity 
trading in such product on the Website which is in effect as of the date of 
the execution of such Transaction...""

(underlined text inserted) 

I think this will please the commercial and tax people; any thoughts from the 
legal side?"

"The Hearings
The hearings have transitioned to the more traditional, courtroom-like 
environment, with lawyers engaged in detailed cross-examination of utility 
witnesses.
The hearing focused solely on the utility claims of financial hardship.
The hearings went from 9AM-5PM and only managed to make it through two PG&E 
witnesses--extensive, detailed questions on PG&E's cash management practices 
since restructuring started in 1998.
Questions to witnesses focused in particular on PG&E's use of cash for 
investment and financing activities over the past 2-3 years (e.g., 
dividend/stock repurchase activities, transfer of cash from IOU to parent and 
parent's use of that cash for investment activities).  
Questions also focused on options other than rate increases available to the 
utility (e.g., liquidate certain assets of unregulated biz units, loans from 
parent, bankruptcy).
The commissioners and the ALJ have reacted in extremely hostile manner toward 
PG&E's repeated attempts to amend and add to their proposal as the hearings 
progress.
Questioning of PG&E witnesses will continue at 10 AM on Tuesday, followed by 
Edison witness.
Unclear when the hearings will end, though the Commission is scheduled to 
issue its decision on Thursday.
At this point, it seems very unlikely that the Commission will have developed 
the record necessary to do anything other than raise rates under its general 
ratemaking authority.

Outside the Hearing
Intense negotiations between Governor's office and utility management 
continue.
Seems that the Commission/Administration is beating up on the utilities 
inside the hearing room in an attempt to soften the utilities up and gain 
some leverage in the negotiations taking place outside the hearing room.
Governor continues to try to bring consumer groups into the negotiations with 
utilities, but consumer groups continue to resist and continue to oppose any 
rate increases.
Governor seems to be attempting to set up a situation where the Commission 
absorbs the political heat for raising rates on the 4th, and the Governor 
follows-up with a more comprehensive set of proposals as part of his state of 
the state speech on the 8th."

Stephanie,

Recently, Enron has introduced a new product, US Power Financial Swaps in New 
York.  I noticed customers are not transacting often on those products and I 
believe it is due to financials not being open to trade with a number of 
companies.  Below I have listed  key customers that need to have this option 
to trade.

American Electric Power Service Corporation
Consolidated Edison Energy, Inc
Florida Power & Light Company
HQ Energy Services (U.S.) Inc.
New York State Electric & Gas Corporation
Select Energy, Inc.
Ontario Power Generation Inc.
Sithe Power Marketing Inc.
Allegheny Energy, Inc.

Please open these companies if they can trade financials online.  Keep me 
posted on the status.

Thank you very much for your time.

Sara,

Bruce Harris gave me you name as a contact for getting a copy of Enron's 
approved ISDA documentation.  I am looking a helping our 50% owned 
subsidiary, CIESA do an interest rate swap to fix rates on its $220MM 
floating rate note agreement.  The existing swap which was done in 1997 runs 
off on 10/22/99.  The tax department here at Enron (South America) have asked 
me to let them review any swap documentation we plan on entering into 
beforehand so they can look at any tax issues (i.e., tax law changes that may 
have occured since the last swap was done).  

I am not sure what documentation was used the last time around - I have asked 
the financial folks at TGS which manages the CIESA FRN on behalf of Enron and 
Perez Companc to send me a copy of whatever documentation was used before as 
a starting place but haven't heard back from them.  Do you happen to have any 
information on the previous swap?

I am on my way to Dallas for the day.  I will give you a call tomorrow to 
check in.  Thanks.

Subject: mendo road

We want to go ahead with the road repair.  Nancy said the cost was about
$900.  However, we want to hold off on doing the stumps.  Nancy doesn't
think we go there often enough to spend the money right now to do that.
Can
anything be done about the culvert that didn't entail too much expense?

I'm having difficulty finding out what the duty is on the wine we
brought in
here.  If you could, without spending a lot of time, find out what it
costs
per liter above the 3 liter amount you can bring into Mexico duty-free.
It
would help us negotiate with the authorities here if we knew what the
amount
should be.

"Laura,

We can definitely help Jose. We are producing the demand projections for
natural gas by state, by customer class every day. The projections
are used to forecast AGA storage numbers and have a very
good history of hitting the right number. This validate svery well the
demand model.

Getting the supply curve at a specific location is more difficult because
other regions are competing for the same finite quantity of gas
available in the short run. We have some good insights into this
problem as well.

My concern is that summer associates are not fully committed to Enron.
I have about 7-8 summer associates every year and we always take measures
to keep them away from critical information.
Please, let me know how far we can go with Jose.

I am ready to help you with baseball. I went to a game last week
and Astros won. I guess I brought some good Karma.

Vince,

Hope all is well with you.  If this baseball season continues to develop, we may need you in Chicago...

I have a summer associate in Houston, Jose Molina, who has inquired regarding Enron's ability to develop a supply/demand  curve.  In our group (Gas Fundamentals/Trading/Origination) we spend a significant amount of time and effort tracking correlations in an array of price/supply/demand scenarios.  Jose is questioning if we can take this more specifically to a scientific approach.  I recommended that he spend time with your or someone in your group to develop his idea and determine feasibility.

I would appreciate if someone could schedule time with Jose.  I always want to encourage an inquisitive nature.

Let me know.

Regards,

Laura Luce"

Mark, 

I am not sure if you had a chance to contact Louise Kitchens or Andy Zipper 
regarding the Energy Bar Association program, but I just wanted to check.? If 
neither of them are available, has Mark Haedicke returned from travel?? If 
so, would you recommend that I give him a call.

I know that you are very busy and greatly appreciate your assistance.

are netting to 0.

Paul, let me know if you have questions.  For July, the imbalance is actually 
in CES's pool and I have no idea how to adjust that.  For August forward, I 
believe we should just bill you for the actual metered production volumes 
since the imbalance will be in Clinton's pool.  Let me know if you want to

Chris - this buy/sell deal with Phillips (seller) and Clinton (buyer) is 
causing some
problems for these guys in settlements.  Wade is paying by mcf's, so when I 
change
the volumes for Phillips, it of course effects Donnie's volumes for Clinton.  
Should this
not be done as a buy/sell, or what should we do about this?  I will be out of 
the office
tomorrow, but back on Monday.  Donnie is needing an answer on this soon.  So 
far,
it looks like 07/00 and 08/00.  Thanks, Gloria

In some of this morning's analysis w/r/t our discussion yesterday...

* The net EUR/$ equity flow is Euro supportive currently mainly due to US
buying in Euroland, the same is happening with US investors buying
Japan. Net government bond flows are also US$ bearish both with
Euroland and with Japan, the latter due to strong signs of Japanese
repatriation still.
*  All this backs up what seemed a peculiar weakening of the US$
yesterday. For the remainder of the year the big question for the Dollar is
will foreigners want to add to their holdings of US assets when they
already hold 11% of the US equity market, 21% of corporate bonds and
36% of the Treasury market?
* We know that the there is likely to be net FDI outflow from the US in
2003,
with our pipelines suggesting a net US$46.2bn pending outflow currently
the worst it has been for many years. It is noteworthy that FDI has funded
around a third of the US current account deficits over the last 3 years, as
important as, net equity inflow.

Today's focus: Get ready for virtual businesses
---------------------------------------------
By Mike Jude and Nancy Meachim

The ASP model as it is currently formulated is not really viable in the
long run.

Though hosting applications has opened a world of possibilities and
cost savings for end users, application service providers who simply
host applications don=01,t have much to offer. They also have the problem
of being the customer contact. If the network fails and customers can=01,t
access an application, they blame their ASP, not the network provider.

For these reasons, many ASPs are expanding to offer more value, such as
delivering network services along with their applications. Enterprise
Management Associates advocates this approach - but looking to the
future, as analysts are supposed to do, we see a much longer value
chain. Providing other services along with applications is one step up,
but beyond that, we see a huge potential in the virtual space ASPs have
created.

We are already beginning to see pioneering companies exploring the
possibilities. For example, Minnesota company Agiliti is building an
online suite of applications with a consistent front end. This
coordinated suite of business applications is accessed through third-
party partners who provide customer care and support. The value that
Agiliti offers is the integration and maintenance for a complete,
business-enabling software infrastructure. In a sense, this is an
online corporate back office.

As ASPs evolve into full-service providers, more of them will offer
service and support combinations similar to Agiliti=01,s. But what about
the front end of the business, the product development side of things?
We=01,ve found one ASP that has evolved quickly to become a full-service,
front-end infrastructure provider, offering product development,
fabrication and prototyping.

Toolwire, a Silicon Valley start-up, provides a complete, integrated
tool set for electrical engineers. This tool set incorporates state-of-
the-art design and fabrication software, as well as online information
and training in the latest tools and support from various electronic
suppliers and fabricators. Toolwire=01,s vision is to provide a virtual
space where engineers worldwide can collaborate on the design of
advanced electronic devices. Through an extensive partner network,
Toolwire provides not only tools but also collaborative space,
processing power, training and supplier support. In a nutshell, the
company sells a virtual corporation to any entrepreneur with a good
idea. Ultimately, Toolwire expects to expand to incorporate the supply-
and-distribution chain through its site as well.

As e-commerce speeds up, a significant advantage is gained by reducing
the latency involved in delivering new products to market. In the area
of electronics, latency is often due to the acquisition of new tools to
facilitate the design process. Toolwire=01,s approach dramatically reduces
latency for start-ups by eliminating the need to invest in highly
volatile and very expensive design tool sets. Likewise, Agiliti reduces
latency by off-loading the IT infrastructure support from an enterprise.

Breaking new ground, of course, carries with it the problem of
definition. What do you call this new virtual workplace, which combines
all the necessary tools to design, produce, market and deliver a
product without the need for any physical infrastructure? (Agiliti and
Toolwire haven=01,t reached this goal yet, but it is within their sights.)
The label we=01,ve come up with is =01&virtual business service provider.=
=018
This entity transcends the full-service ASP by not only providing
access to the services and applications a company needs but also
actually providing the entire company itself.

Companies like Agiliti and Toolwire are commodifying the enterprise.
The day is coming, very shortly, when an entrepreneur with a good idea
will be able to sit down at a terminal; design a product; ship the
specs to a fabricator; order components; plug into the appropriate
accounting, billing and inventory systems; line up distribution
channels, sales and marketing resources; and obtain financing. And the
entrepreneur will be able to do all that without touching anything more
physical than a keyboard.

Welcome to the business in a box!

roundtable this week.  This is the web site with registration:

I will be interested to talk to you after to see what you learn/who you 
meet,etc.  By the way, if you get a chance, please say hello to Michael 
Zenker. He 
runs the CERA office in CA and I spoke with him briefly last week on the 
phone (a friend of mine, Sean Becker, who works at CERA's Cambridge office 
got us in touch).   

If it is really valuable roundtable, let me know and perhaps I could arrange 
to go to the roundtable they are holding in Calgary on May 2.

This is just a rumor, but we heard on the EPSA call today that Scott Miller 
is trying to get his report on the California part of his investigation to 
the Commissioners by Friday of this week.  

Also, the EPSA/Boston Pacific paper continues to be revised, but EPSA wants 
to get it to FERC as soon as possible (but if Scott completes his report by 
Friday it may not be in time for Scott's report), so they have asked us to 
review the report and Executive Summary and get comments back to them for a 
conference call on Friday.  Since we will be at FERC during the EPSA call, we 
will need to get any comments we may have to Julie by Thursday evening or 
Friday morning.

Thanks everyone.

"In regards to the e-mail you just sent - this is the most recent information 
I sent you and Brooklyn. Is this what you were missing?

Also, in response to your question about deal 595155 - where we show a buy 
from EES but Brooklyn doesn't show a sale on her side - this deal is shown in 
EnPower as well as my sheet. If you looked in the fixed price column of the 
sheet for 4/28, under SP-15, you'll see a sale for 10 MW hours 6 through 22. 
I'm not sure what it is, but somewhere there's a missing link between us and 
EES, because on my side this deal looks perfectly normal.

I'll also be sending along some revised Real Time sheets per my conversation 
with Brooklyn yesterday - you should receive those shortly. In the meantime, 
look over my sheet and let me know if you see the deal in question on the 
28th.

Subject: Re: Latest Information On April EES Items  

At long last, I've sorted through these deals and determined the source of 
most of these problems. I'll be calling you both shortly to go over these and 
make sure we all see the same thing. Here are a few things to note as you go 
over my responses:

566426 - rates have been changed/has this shown up on your CARP report yet?
578856 - deal done by Real Time trader at hour-ahead market price/will not 
correspond directly to the price shown in my spreadsheet
573862 - rate for this deal should not be $107 OR $168.45/it is an off peak 
sale from EPMI to EES, which means we go by the off peak short position price 
- shown in my sheet as $119.76

The newest deals in this variance list are Real Time. I've double-checked the 
deals in EnPower with what I see in the Real Time spreadsheets, and 
everything seems to match up. I'm attaching those sheets so we can ensure 
we're all looking at the same thing. If you have further discrepancies on 
these, the easiest way for me to clear them up would be if you include the 
specific hours you have questions about.

I'm terribly sorry for the delay in getting back to you on this - it's a 
twisted and time-consuming journey trying to find the source of these 
problems, as I'm sure you know! I hope this gets us up to speed, but please 
call me with questions or comments.

Thanks,

I got this from Hanson.  Please advise as to which points we agree with and 
which we disagree with.  I want to know because I talk to this guy quite a 
bit and EES and ENA are trying to do a deal with him.  I probably will have 
several opportunities to influence him, if necessary.  Barbara Barkovich and 
Bill Booth probably had a big hand in developing this doc.



Any follow up necessary?

"Clement,
 Russell Diamond of the Enron Credit group would like Enron to issue to 
Engage (now known as Coastal Merchant Energy, L.P.) a blanket guarantee 
covering obligations of ENA, EPMI, ECC and Clinton Energy Management 
Services, Inc. without necessarily tying those obligations to specific 
contracts.  Do you have a form of guaranty that could be used for this.  I 
think that the guaranty would still have a limit ($25MM)?.  Please advise.

Russell,
 The below two documents are the credit worksheet and the contract 
relationship documents which you provided.  The credit worksheet states that 
the guaranty should cover ENA, EPMI, ECC and Clinton Energy Management 
Services, Inc. and additionally should cover the master energy agreement with 
EPMI.  Do we have a date of execution or effective date for such master 
energy agreement.  The contract relationship document merely states that the 
guaranty should cover the new master firm purchase sale agreement  that ENA 
is negotiating with Engage and an master energy agreement between EPMI and 
____.  No agreements of any type are specified for ECC or Clinton Energy 
Management Services, Inc.  Also, are any of the Master Swap agreements that 
ENA has with Engage to be covered by the requested guaranty?  I believe that 
we need to get together at your convenience and determine exactly which 
contracts Enron Corp. is to cover with the guaranty agreement being offered 
as a part of the security for the Master Firm Purchase Sale Agreement.  
Please let me know when you will be available to discuss.

I provided all the information that you are asking for on the original credit 
worksheet I e-mailed to ENA legal on August 29.  You will notice in the 
comments section the Enron entities I wanted covered in the guaranty along 
with the Contracts that needed to be reference.  If you need a copy the 
specific contracts that need to be covered they can be obtained through the 
documentation group, or through 'Live Link' on our computers.  Please make 
note of the name change that has now occurred with respect to Engage.

 We need closure on the guaranty issue.  All of the guaranty formats you 
provided to me covered specific enron entities under specific contracts that 
were identified in the guaranty.  If you can give me the specific contracts 
for each of the other enron entities you want covered by the Gas physical 
master contract of ENA whose payment obligations to Engage Energy Marketing, 
L.P.you want guarantied by Enron, I will take the lead to draft the guaranty 
and have it forward to Enron Corp for approval prior to sending it out as a 
draft to Engage Energy Marketing, L.P.

Dan,

This is in response to my continued efforts with legal to make note of my 
intended priority of executing a Master Firm with Coastal Energy (formerly 
Engage US).  As previous e-mails below indicate and phone calls with the ENA 
legal group and Coastal, the draft has yet to be sent out.  I have confirmed 
with Coastal today, they have STILL not received the draft although are 
expecting this from ENA.  We have outstanding exposure with this entity and 
is important from a credit, legal, and contractual standpoint that an 
agreement is executed.  I understand that in the past they have been 
unwilling to negotiate a Master although I want one put in place. Please do 
what you need to, to get this draft sent to the counterparty.

Regards,
Russell

Per Debra's e-mail to me, why can we not include other entities on this 
guaranty, it seems we have got guaranty's in place with other counterparty's 
in which they reference specific contracts as well as entities not related to 
the  contract, i.e. Sempra, Duke, Aquila, Dynegy,......  

Dan,
I see the execution of this contract as a priority considering the trading 
volumes on Enron Online and current market conditions.  I know in the past, 
we have been unable to negotiate a Master Firm with Engage US, although their 
legal group is fully aware of our request to negotiate a contract. Please 
send the draft out to the contact listed on the credit worksheet and 
priortize the negotiation of this contract.

Russell

Apology not necessary!  However, you are very kind to consider my
perspective on the group and project.  I am certainly a bit frustrated with
how this project is turning out.  We should have ""white boarded"" our ideas
and reached consensus in the very beginning I think.  It would have saved
all of us time.  I'm counting on Mark to drive this home for us smoothly.

But, at the end of the day, I am pleased with how much I learned in Tasker's
class, which is the ultimate point anyway.

Carolyn:

I wanted to apologize for the way the group dynamic has shaped up.  It's
clear to me that you're a bit frustrated, and if I've contributed, I
apologize.

You've done the most work on this project, your contribution has been very
significant, and I personally am not satisfied about the way that the stuff
you've pulled together (and your views) have been included.  At some point,
though, it gets tough beating one's head against the wall.  Seems to me
that, in a group, everyone should have some of their views
included---that's what groups and compromises are all about.  After all,
it's school.  We've made a lot of sacrifices to do it, and the point is to
learn.

Anyway, I hope you'll still comment on the presentation, and I'm glad that
you've agreed to do part of it on Thursday.  For my part, I felt that I
pushed yesterday about as much as I'm prepared to push and at this point,
I'll put the ratios tables together, offer a few edits, buy don' t see much
use going to the mat.

Overall, I think it'll be an okay presentation, though getting there has
been, well, bumpy.

But thanks very much for all the work you did.  It was important, and the
presentation is better off for it.

Best,
Jeff

Houston.  So if you know such a program existing, please let me know.
She is in town for the semester break if there is such a program, may
be she can visit with someone there to have an interview.

Hi Iris

I have two different hats to wear in talking to Enron.  One is as a
financial economist.  The other as the Director of the newly formed ""Global
Mobility Innovation Initiative (GMII) -- this is the research project
funded by Lucent, involving BU, LBS, and INSEAD, to study various aspects
of the mobile Internet (read 3G).

On the former I am working with a couple of Ph.D. students in understanding

(a) details of how having physical supply (inventory) can be used by a
market maker.   This is a problem that has been studies in the context of
specialists inventory in the stock market but I think really interesting in
the way Enron does it in some of the newer markets like bandwidth.    I
think this is a big issue in lighting up all the dark fiber  that is in the
ground.

(b) how Enron is disciplining the internal decision making process with
market.  This is in many ways the critical aspect of  real options that
most finance people miss -- having options is one thing but exercising them
and realizing their value is another.  All of the incomplete contracting,
asymmetric information, and incentive issues are ignored in real options
valuation models.  But they are real in practice.  My impression is Enron's
real success is in putting place an organization that is able to mitigate
these problems by imposing a market disciplining.

(c) how Enron manages the various books that involve physicals, financials,
credit etc.  This is specially important when many of the real assets have
options features and therefore, include non-linear risk profiles.  The
story of gas  is pretty well understood but not many of the others markets
Enron has been moving into over the last few years.

On the GMII front, I think that some interesting opportunities arise when
you think of the spectrum in a way similar to that of dark fiber.   I am
working with several people at Lucent on this issue.  I think it would be
wonderful to engage in a conversation with Enron and Lucent folks in the room.

I can do a lunch time talk on any of these issues.  Perhaps we can discuss
some of these over a conference call. Clearly, having Vince Kaminski in the
room would be very important to me.

As for schedules, the first 3 weeks of April are horrible.  April 26/27,
May 3/4 are good for me.

Regards

Nalin

Kay-I have reviewed the GE acknowledgment, and I believe it does everything
InterGen would want in that GE permits the multiple transfers all the way to

not result in a breach of the Facility Agreements.  I have also reviewed the
unanimous consents and find them to be OK.

I propose going back to George with the proposal that simultaneously with
the execution of the unanimous consent that ENA be permitted to exercise its
puts under the two LLC, which can be done with InterGen's consent and
InterGen's receipt of an acknowledgment from GE that the exercise of the put
will not in any manner prejudice the rights under the Facility Agreements
(which in view of the transfer of the turbines and the Facility Agreements
being permitted by GE, such a request may be superfluous, but I'd like to
have it anyway).

I considered also recommending a release from ENA's obligations under the
Letter Agreements, but I think that may be pushing too far.

Let me know your thoughts.

FYI

Calif. ISO may vote again on power price cap cut


     LOS ANGELES, July 10 (Reuters) - The California Independent System 
Operator (ISO) Board of Governors may try for a third time to pass a motion 
to cut a cap on power prices to $250 per megawatt hour (MWh) from its current 
$500 per MWh.

     ""It wouldn't surprise me if in the next few days there is a request to 
add it to the August 1 agenda,"" a member of the ISO Board of Governors said 
on Monday.

     The California ISO operates most of the state's power grid.

     Last week its governing board voted by 12 votes to nine, with one 
abstention, in favor of lowering the cap but failed to secure the 13 votes 
necessary to pass under the motion under ISO rules.

     The previous week a vote to cut the cap to $250 per MWh failed to pass 
after a 12-12 vote but a new meeting was called after one member, Marcie 
Edwards of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, declared she had 
incorrectly cast her vote against the lower cap.

     Two members were absent overseas during last week's vote. One, John 
McGuire of Silicon Valley Power, had supported the cut to $250 at the June 28 
vote. He is due to return from vacation on July 26.

     The other absent member, Daniel Kirschner of the Environmental Defense 
Fund, is due to return from overseas during the next couple of days, sources 
said.

     It was not clear which way Kirschner is likely to vote as he was also 
absent from the June 28 vote. The board at 25 members on the June 28 vote, 
but one member resigned before the subsequent vote.

     Pressure to cut the cap has come from several sources including state 
Sen. Steve Peace, whose San Diego constituents have been angered by sharply 
higher electricity bills recently.

     Under rules governing the deregulation of the state's power industry 
customers of San Diego Gas and Electric are currently the only ones exposed 
to market prices.

     ""He (Peace) is getting all kinds of hate mail and is really trying to do 
something,"" an industry source said.

     San Diego Gas and Electric is a unit of Sempra Energy .

     Rates for customers of California's other two investor owned utilities, 
Edison International's Southern California Edison and PG&E Corp.'s Pacific 
Gas and Electric, are currently frozen.

     Other proponents of cutting the cap including Loretta Lynch, president 
of the California Public Utilities Commission and a close aide to Governor 
Gray Davis.

     San Diego Gas and Electric has called an emergency summit of energy 
market participants -- including power generators, energy service providers 
and representatives of the California Independent System Operator and 
California Power Exchange - on Wednesday to explore solutions to the soaring 
prices.

     Supporters of cutting the cap believe the power market is not ""workably 
competitive"" and prices rose to excessive levels during a recent heatwave, 
putting an unfair burden on both ratepayers and shareholders of investor 
owned utilities.

     Opponents are led by independent power producers who have argued a lower 
cap could make it more difficult for the state to import power at times of 
shortage.

Is all this being worked with Nora Dobin?  I think some of these are in the volumetric production payment vehicles.  we need to be careful.  Nancy, will you call Nora Dobin?

Eric:  are any of these tied to the production payment deals?  Please advise us all.

Jesus Melendrez, who is managing the ECR portfolio, has asked that the subject swaps be terminated. None of them is in the money for ENA. I have put together a small file folder for each and Eric Boyt has been asked to provide updated values. These are in l purple folders on my desk should I not be available . I am happy to liase with Jesus but seems to me that one of the swap attorneys who is more conversant with the ISDAs, T&Cs, swaps and ENA's current position re same should weigh in. Basic question is what approval is required to terminate.  The relevant interests are as follows :

Cresendo Energy LLC - 50 % JEDI ll , 50 % Trutta
Juniper - 75 % JEDI ll, 25 % Trutta
CGAS -  100% McGarret
East Sour Lake -100 % Trutta

from Enron.  Steve has made a choice to leave Enron and to join another 
company in the industry.  I know that you will join me in thanking him for 
his many years of service to Enron and the contributions that he has made.  
His risk expertise and his knowledge of ENA transactions will be missed, as 
will his leadership on the gas team.  Although Steve's official last day with 
the company is in two weeks, today is his last day in the office.  He will be 
available by phone over the next two weeks if there are questions that you 
may have on any open items that you were covering with Steve.  Patti has his 
home number if you need that.  We will also plan a happy hour for Steve and 
we will let you know when and where that will take place.  

Effective tomorrow, Jeff Gossett will assume leadership of the gas risk 
group, reporting to me.  Jeff will join Bob Hall and Leslie Reeves as 
business controllers for Natural Gas, to continue to work together to provide 
leadership for the processes, controls, people and systems that support all

"OK, the tours are booked (it ain't much anyway).  But you're on the guest 
list for a complimentary OPUS tasting (see previous note).  OPUS is across 
the street from and just south of the main Mondavi winery.  When you get 
there, check in with the concierge, who will have your name and will set up 
with the complimentary tasting.  It gets real crowded sometimes, which causes 
them to close the gates.  If that occurs, you simply need to buzz the 
intercom and give them your name and they'll let you in and set you up.  You 
should really do the tasting----the wine is simply awe-inspiring and it's a 
cool place.  Finally, they're open from 10:30-3:30.  Later it gets, crazier 
it gets.  I suggest you try to get there around 11:30, which will ensure that 
you get the attention you deserve.

Have a great time.

	Per your request for an update:

	1.  ECT sent its insurance claim letter out to Underwriters' adjusters in this matter last week.  No reply has yet been received.  We will monitor.

	2.  Mitsubishi has not pushed its demurrage claim of about $260,000.  Our solicitor, David Best, has had confirmed by our barrister that our time-bar defense against the demurrage claim is strong.

	3.  We are paying joint testing invoices 100% and submitting them for 50 % reimbursement to Mitsubishi.  So far, despite its agreement to do so, Mitsubishi has not reimbursed us at all.  We suspect that if we push this, Mitsubishi will start threatening to start up with the demurrage claim again.  At least until we find out what Underwriters' position will be, we do not suggest pushing Mitsubishi on this.

	I will keep you advised.

		 Subject: FW: footnnote each item under Exhibit B



REGARDING THE SETTLEMENT, ASSIGNMENT AND ASSUMPTION AGREEMENT

Tracy Ngo correctly pointed out volumetric ambiguities on the two original
confirmations between Avista Energy and PG&E Energy Trading.

Let me summarize below:

(1) Avista Energy's original confirmation number 404335 showed Total Volume
of 982,400 MWh's.  PG&E revised the Total Volume to 981,600 MWh.  Avista did
not respond with an affirmation of the corrected volume.  Our records show
that the original volume of 982,400 is correct (there was a leap-year day in
year 2000).  The broker confirm and the PG&E revision seem to be both in
error.  Obviously any new confirm that is written between Avista Energy and
Enron will have the proper Total Volume for the remaining MWh's.  Since this
Assignment references the original confirmation, our counsel recommends
language to be inserted under Exhibit B as stated below (see email from
Blair Strong below).  Will this sort of revision be acceptable to PG&E and
Enron? Please advise.

(2) Avista Energy's original confirmation number 403862 showed a Total
Volume of 14,400.  PG&E accepted the confirm ""as is.""  The broker
confirmation shows total volume correctly as 876,000 MWh's.  Therefore, both
PG&E and AVISTA screwed up.  HOwever, we acknowledge that the total MWh's
should correctly be as per the broker confirmation.  Again, our counsel
recommends language to be inserted under Exhibit B as stated below (see
email from Blair Strong below).  Will this sort of revision be acceptable to
PG&E and Enron?  Please advise.


To reiterate, we realize that there will be new confirmations between Enron
and Avista.  Enron has traditionally written the confirmations (Enron's
confirm's prevail).  Therefore, the new confirms should be acceptable.  We
would like to see those confirms in advance if possible.

Lastly, time is of the essense.  We are scheduling power already for January
deliveries....therefore, we must act quickly on this assignment so as to
prevent any problems with scheduling, etc.  I suppose that we could delay
the start dates to February 1st, 2001 if necessary.  Perhaps not a big
issue.

Thanks,
Nolan Steiner

requested from your supervisor, it would be helpful for me to have a copy of 
your resume (not necessary to repeat, if you gave me one at mid-year).  While 
the PRC process will focus on your accomplishments during the prescribed time

Sara, Allegheny would like to be able to assign to affilaites in the same
manner that we are allowing Enron to make an ssignment so long as the Gty
goes along.  In our case, however, there is no gty, hence the stipualtion
that such assignment must be to an entity with an equal or better credit
rating.  If you wish, I can limit such assignment to an entity rated at
least BBB+ or better.  Would that resolve your concerns?

"It's hard to disagree with the fact that 1) the utilities are the ones that 
cut the deal they're living with and 2) they took all of the ""stranded cost"" 
money that consumers paid them and invested it in other states and 
countries.  

But you can only buy for 10 cents and sell for 5 cents for so long before 
creditors turn off the spigot.  Difficult to see how the spigot stays on with 
the draft decision issued today.  (See story attached, below.)  

With bankruptcy, the only one making any decisions is the judge, and while 
some see benefits to that, seems to us that from a political, financial and 
commercial perspective, bankruptcy creates many more problems than it solves.

That said, we're extremely sensitive to the politics of rate increases.  But 
if the increases are subject to refund, then decision makers can buy 
themselves some time by erring just slightly to the high side of a rate 
increase, which could fend off the ratings agencies and provide additional 
opportunity over the next 90 days or so to scrutinize the utilities claims 
and come up with comprehensive solutions to the bigger problems.

Well, you got my two cents.  Sorry about that.  

Best,
Jeff

Late afternoon 1/3/01 news:


USA: Calif utility ratings may fall too far on 7-15 pct hike.
By Jonathan Stempel

01/03/2001 
Reuters English News Service 
(C) Reuters Limited 2001. 

NEW YORK, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Bankruptcy may loom and the credit ratings of the 
two largest California electric utilities will likely fall too far if that 
state's Public Utilities Commission awards them an interim rate hike of 7 to 
15 percent, analysts said Wednesday.

In a draft decision on Wednesday, the CPUC proposed an immediate hike of 9 
percent for residential customers of Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern 
California Edison, and hikes of seven to 15 percent for various business 
customers.

The CPUC commission is expected to issue a final decision on Thursday.

""It forces the utilities and their creditors to be limbo dancers, and skilled 
limbo dancers at that,"" said Shawn Burke, head of U.S. investment-grade 
research at Barclays Capital.

PG&E and SCE had requested respective rate increases of 26 percent and 30 
percent, a hike that would help them avoid imminent bankruptcy.

The utilities have also asked the regulators to remove a freeze on retail 
rates imposed under California's 1996 law that deregulated the state's 
electricity market.

On a day when most stocks roared ahead after the Federal Reserve announced 
surprise interest rate cuts, investors beat down the stocks of Pacific G&E's 
parent, San Francisco-based PG&E Corp. , and SoCal Edison's parent, Edison 
International .

PG&E shares closed Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange at $17, down 
$2-9/16, or 13.1 percent, while Edison International shares closed at 
$12-1/4, down $2-3/4, or 18.3 percent, on the Big Board.

Bond quotations were not immediately available for the utilities' bonds, 
which in recent weeks have traded like junk.

Pacific G&E and SoCal Edison were banking on a big rate hike to allow them to 
pass on some of their soaring wholesale power costs to consumers.

The utilities, which operate under a rate freeze, have accumulated more than 
$8 billion in unrecovered costs since wholesale power prices started 
skyrocketing last summer amid a worsening electricity shortage in the state. 
They claim they are running out of money due to the price freeze, and have 
billions of dollars of bills coming due in the next six weeks.

Central to their concerns is whether credit rating agencies Moody's Investors 
Service and Standard & Poor's will cut their medium investment grades to junk 
status.

""No one knows for sure, but if we consider the average rate hike is only 
about 10 percent, it will be difficult for the companies to maintain 
investment-grade ratings,"" said Dorothea Matthews, a fixed-income electric 
utilities analyst for Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown.

The utilities have already been unable to tap short-term capital markets 
because of their precarious financial state.

Downgrades to junk, which the agencies have already threatened, would cement 
the door shut to these markets, and cause the utilities to default on some of 
their loans.

Late Wednesday, PG&E Chief Executive Gordon Smith said the commission's 
proposed hikes could jeopardize his utility's future loans.

Even a downgrade to the lowest investment grades - ""Baa3"" for long-term debt 
and ""Prime-3"" for short-term debt from Moody's, and ""BBB-minus"" and ""A3"" from 
S&P - would make the going very difficult for the utilities. The reason: 
short-term debt markets are often closed to companies with those ratings.

""Unless this process allows the rating agencies to keep 'A2/P2' ratings on 
the short-term debt of both companies, then this process has largely been a 
waste of everyone's time,"" said Burke.

Still, he said, ""there is a reasonable chance, despite today's weak 
recommendation, that the situation can be salvaged with mid-'triple-B' 
ratings, which would allow a lifeline to conventional sources of liquidity.""

Moody's and S&P were not available for comment.

Forgive the delay.  Much going on today, PUC draft decision in particular.
The draft does not look promising for the utilities' financial position.

research for you and will turn that around as quickly as we can.

Thanks for your voice mail message.  David Dupre and I have not done all that 
much to date.  He is in the process of compiling information for all 
counterparties (online and offline) who are not signing confirms.  I have 
asked him to group these counterparties according to total outstanding 
exposure so that we can priortize our efforts.  I think that the main issues 
to cover on Friday involve:

1. The effect of not getting signed confirms when we have our standard 
langugae in the confirm or in the ISDA and whether it makes adifference as to 
whether NY or Texas law applies.

2. Possible alternative approaches that we can suggest to counterparties.  
For example, in some cases, a counterparty is sending us a letter attaching a 
list of the deals that they have done with us and stating that they agree 
with the terms of such deals.  I'll have David D. send up a sample.

3. Whether our concerns are greater or lesser when we do trades online.

I'm available anytime to talk about the above.

I made a minor adjustment to the LOI re: exclusivity.    

 << File: Midway TECO LOI june 1.doc >> 

Policy states that any time we sign up to exclusivity we are supposed to get 
it approved by Mark Metts, Tim Detmering and the CEO of the affected business

"Glad to hear the rest of your trip went well.  

The 'normal' sailing trip is a week but that's not cast in stone.  In an 
effort to maximize days sailing and minimize days of vacation taken we 
usually fly down on a Saturday arriving in the afternoon or eve., pick up the 
boat on Sunday (you get the boat around noon) and bring it back the following 
Sunday (by noon), take a shower and head straight for the airport.  Because 
of the way the flight schedules work it's usually not possible to leave after 
work on a Friday and make it all of the way down there.  You could do a 
shorter trip, of course, but I never have.  I've gone for longer (we did a 10 
day one-way sail from St. Lucia down to the southern end of Grenada, stopping 
in Bequia and Mustique, among others, along the way) but that's a pretty long 
trip and certainly not necessary.  Most of the charter fleets are based where 
there is plenty to do right in the area for a week.  One of the reasons for 
aiming at Thanksgiving was to reduce the total number of vacation days 
spent.  I get both Thurs & Fri off so I only have to spend 3 days to get a 
whole week - I understand the gov't may not be so generous.  I haven't taken 
all of my days this year so I can always carry some over to 2001 if that 
works better for you guys.

My views on when to go:

January - March 
Very fun since you will be sick of winter, very popular so a lot more crowded 
(harder to find a place to anchor for the night and have to make arrangements 
farther ahead), everything is open for business, high season rates.

April - May
Less crowded (unless Easter or Spring breaks are late), shoulder season rates.

June - August
No crowds (you may have some anchorages to yourself), many places are closed 
for the season (think beach bars and meals on shore), low rates.

September - October
See June-August and add in highest risk of hurricanes 
(http://www.storm2000.com).  My guess is that people who planned their trips 
to the BVI for this week aren't having much fun right now but they got  GREAT 
deals and the Moorings will probably give them a refund.  I've chartered 
during this period several times and had a blast.  One time a tropical storm 
came through and we stayed on the boat in port - I still get mileage out of 
the stories.  You just have to be willing to live with the risk that it may 
not go according to plan (not seriously dangerous, though - you're always 
within easy reach of the base - if a bad one threatens you just take the boat 
back and let them deal with it).

November - December
Hurricane threat drops dramatically.  Crowds pick up around Christmas, 
everything opens up again, rates start to go up again.

Bottom line:  I love the trips so much it doesn't matter what time of year - 
just let me know what works best for you guys.  Keep in mind that you do have 
to make arrangements at least 2 months in advance (more is better) to make 
sure you get flights and the boat that you want.

One last thought - it is possible for the main group to pick up the boat on 
schedule and arrange to be near the airport on a later day in the trip to 
pick someone up.  This is definitely suboptimal.  You learn a lot about the 
boat and the sailing area from the briefings the charter company gives you at 
the start and it limits flexibility to have to be by the airport on a certain 
day when you might rather have the boat at the other end of the island chain 
or wherever.  I'd rather put the whole thing off until we can all go at once 
but if it's the only way, at least it's an option.

Mark"
"Beavy and I changed the following deals for July and August.  We took all the 
August activity to 0.  This is how these deals should be balanced

Deal 318562 with 318686.  And 318691 with 318682.

I'll look at the economics in the morning.

"Rick, et al --

I don't know if we need to do this study and the work that Seabron and LECG 
would be doing.  Maybe we incorporate these guys into the mix during the work 
up of the analysis.  

I think that we need to make sure that we have the right questions to ask.  I 
will get with Jeff Dasovich and Joe Hartsoe and Mary Hain to make sure that 
we (1) have the right questions and (2) have the right parties answering the 
questions.  Then let's look at our current resources and go outside only if 
necessary.

Robert Michaels is proposing a consultant study looking at the California 
electricity chaos (see attached).  It is roughly a $100,000 study before 
printing and distribution costs with a delivery date of December 1.  The 
study would also involve Ken Malloy's Center for the Advancement of Energy 
Markets.

I think Robert would do a good job but raise these issues:

1) This is expensive.  It is at consultant rates and is not an academic study 
where a think tank can get the professors to do something at less cost

2) Malloy is pretty heavy into this at a cost of $14,400 of about 40% of 
Michaels.  His NARUC connections are very important, and we would want him on 
the popularization side, but this is too much.

3) The study might need a co-author with lots of academic credibility to join 
Robert as good as he is.

I'm glad that we have this proposal--it will force us to think about what we 
want, who does it, and how it should be distributed.  We should also think 
about how much industry money we could gather to fund such an effort (it 
should be large given the stakes).

Can you provide your impressions so I can get back to Robert?

"I have prepared a mirror deal between HPL Supply Co and ENA for the Entex 
deals on the Sales List.  In talking with Gary Lamphier the deals with Shell 
Oil Company and with Valero Marketing have not been signed by the 
counterparties and he intends to get them to sign them after he does his next 
deal with them.  Therefore those deals have not been finally papered.  Ed 
Gottlieb is supposed to be having someone pull the ENA deals that are to be 
included with project triple lutz so that a determination can be made of 
whether someone is to contact those parties for permission to include copies 
in the data room, possible assignment to a dummy company which can be 
included in project triple lutz, or treated as the Entex deals by creating a 
back to back between HPL Supply Co and ENA.  So far Ed has not provided me 
any information. Please call if you have any questions.

Following up on the discussion in our staff meeting today, I am forwarding 
information that Sandi requested of Cheryl Dudley this morning.  Please 
review the attached spreadsheet listing of ""Top 10"" purchase, sale and 
transport contracts and call Sandi if you have any knowledge as to why Cheryl 
Dudley might not be able to find executed contracts for any of those 
transactions.  Please note that the list below is NOT the listing of Top 10 
contracts; you'll have to open and look at the spreadsheet.   

If you know that a transaction is in some stage of negotiation, it would be 
helpful to send Sandi the latest draft of the relevant contract.  It would 
also be helpful to know ""the story"" of why the contract is not yet 
completed,  Please call Sandi in the morning (or me) if you have any 
questions.  Thanks for your help in getting this significant matter addressed.

Attached are the files that I received to use in pulling the contracts for 
the Data Room.  I was never given any lists of just the top 10 
purchase/sales/transportation customers.  I believe that those lists were 
used to come up with the contract lists that I was given and that those 
customers are included in the top 25 of each type of contract.  Melissa 
Graves or George Weissman might be able to help with the ""Top 10 Customers"".




Since I couldn't find ""paper"" for some of the original 25 purchase, sales & 
transportation contracts, I continued down the list until I actually had 
""paper"" for 25 of each.
Below is the listing of those additional contracts.

Purchase

Enron
Entity  Counterparty     Global # Contract Type

ENA  Statoil Energy Trading, Inc.   96000579 Master Purchase Sale Spot
HPL  Goldston Oil Corp.    96023410 Committed Reserves Agreement - First

HPL  Goldston Oil Corp.    96003438 Master Purchase Sale Spot
ENA  Duke Energy Trading & Marketing LLC  96007427 Master Purchase Sale Spot 
ENA  North Central Oil Corp.    96005067 Single Transaction Purchase Firm
HPL  Dominion Exploration & Production, Inc.  96022856 Committed Reserves 
Agreement - First Purchaser
     (formerly: Saxet Energy, Ltd.)

Sales

Enron

HPL  Conoco, Inc.     96019743 Transportation - Intrastate - Interruptible
HPL  Sempra Energy Trading Corp.   96018800 Transportation & Storage - 
Intrastate - Interruptible
HPL  Exxon Company, USA    96006309 Transportation - 311 - Interruptible
HPL  Texaco Natural Gas Inc.    96011283 Transportation - Intrastate - 
Interruptible



Today I met with Ed Gottlob, Melissa Graves, etc. & we are trying to get 
""paper"" for the 5 transportation, 7 purchase & 8 sales that ""fell off"" the 
first go-round of the document production.  If we are able to get all of 
those, the additional contracts that I pulled won't be needed any longer.  
(Even though the decision was made to go ahead & leave them in the Data Room.)

If you need anything else, please let me know.

Steve, I have received notice of service in a lawsuit styled:  The People
of the State of California, etc. v. Dynegy Power Marketing, Inc., et al.
(including Enron Power Marketing, Inc. and Enron Energy Services, Inc.)
that was filed in the California Supreme Court, County of San Francisco
(#318189).  I know that this is not in San Diego, but wanted to make sure
that it was not the lawsuit that you were tracking earlier.  It is a
complaint for unfair, unlawful and deceptive trade practices regarding the
deregulation of the California electric power industry.  Let me know if you

Enclosed is the Counterparty form that we have come up with for Multi-Product

Guaranty will need to be modified to make sure that it describes the proper 
entities and products.  I will send along the Enron form of this shortly but 
please pass this along to the appropriate people in the credit group.

Jeff, Stacy and Harry,
Are you going to change the Physical product form of Guaranty to look more 
like this?  Power has changed their form and it may help for us to all be 
consistent especially when we are asked to amend an existing Guaranty to 
include more products.  If you do decide to amend your form, please send the 
new form to credit.

Thanks for everyone's input.

Vince:

In this third e-mail, I write you concerning the interest expressed by two
colleagues in being considered for employment by Enron Corp.:

1.  The first candidate is UT Finance Ph.D. student James Doran, who is
confidentially re-evaluating his interest in the Ph.D. program.  James has
done some consulting work with me in the energy area, and thus has some
background in the field.  Although his quantitative/computing skills do not
quite match those of Cantekin, I strongly believe they warrant an
invitation for interview at Enron, and recommend you consider such an
invitation affirmatively.

I enclose James' resume in Resume2001.doc.

2.  The second candidate is David B. Good, formerly of the Nucleus Corp.  A
resident of Houston, Dave has an MBA from Wharton and several years
experience in the energy sector.  You met Dave during the recent EPRM
training course in Houston.  I have had occasion to work with Dave whilst
he was director of quantitative analysis at Nucleus Corp. and have found
him an MBA with good quantiative skills and excellent intuition.  While I
cannot recommend him for your Research Group, I believe he is well suited
for a structuring/marketing position within Enron.

Dave's resume is also enclosed herewith in DBG resume.doc.

Should you and/or your colleagues have any questions regarding James or
Dave, please feel free to contact me.

Best,

As I mentioned previously, ARM is supporting the SCE approach which does not charge DA customers for the 1 cent.  ARM is working with the Energy Div staff to get a favorable ruling on it.  We decided that approach had the highest probability of success.  But ARM will seek to change the earlier order charging DA if this approach doesn't work. 

 I have not really talked to other ARM members on the PX Credit balances.  I can if you like.  I believe we should follow the requirements in our tariff and ESP/UDC agreement for a dispute as the best first step.

From today's Gas Daily:


=01+Three strikes=01, bill hits California

California Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza,
a Democrat, will introduce a bill today that will
make it a felony for any energy supplier in California
to engage in a conspiracy to drive up prices
or manipulate the market.

The bill would apply to any company selling
gas or electricity into the state or to any of the
state=01,s utilities, said a spokesman for Cardoza.

Under terms of the proposed legislation,
offenders would be subject to California=01,s ""three
strikes"" law, which sentences convicted felons
to jail for life after three offenses. Directors, officers
or any other employees associated with
market manipulation of a company would be
subject to this bill, the spokesman said.

Cardoza will introduce the bill at a press
conference today at 2 p.m. Pacific time. CD

 No easy solutions to crisis

The crisis in California is far beyond short-term
fixes parading as potential solutions, and
there is no turning back for deregulation in the
state, according to a report released yesterday
by consulting firm Andersen.

California has no choice but to forge ahead in
repairing the damage that ill-planned deregulation
measures have caused, the Energy Crisis in the
Western U.S.: Lessons for navigating regulatory
and market minefields report says. ""There=01,s a common
wisdom that knows you can=01,t unscramble the
egg,"" said Matt Smith, head of Andersen=01,s North
American energy consulting practice. All that can
be done is correct the mistakes, he added.
In addition, steps must be implemented to
prevent the spread of the California ""virus"" to
other states=01, electricity marketplaces, Smith said.

""To begin, in our view, the energy crisis in the
western U.S. has produced formidable challenges
for utility industry regulators, state and federal
policymakers, and industry executives,"" Smith said.
""The virus spawned in California requires new strategies
to contain and reverse the damage.

""The implications for the development of
competitive energy markets go far beyond the
western United States. Unfortunately, California
has taught the nation that regulatory and political
barriers can create and sustain an energy crisis.""

The proposed solutions put in motion by
federal and state regulators, as well as California
policymakers, have only led to an increasingly
uncertain market and tension among those
working for a viable resolution, the report says.

""In reaction to the breakdown, many of
California=01,s political leaders now prefer to abandon
deregulation,"" the report says.

The report concludes that power shortages
and blackouts are inevitable this summer. The
deregulated marketplace, which took a year to
throw off track, will more than likely take a number
of years to put right, the report says. MCM

Competing evidence clouds Calif. investigation

Prompted in part by the California Public Utilities Commission, the=20
California Assembly
has been scrutinizing the role that interstate pipelines have played in the=
=20
state=01,s current
energy crisis. In the efforts to find a smoking gun, legislators have leane=
d=20
heavily on a
report prepared by The Brattle Group, a consultancy commissioned by utility=
=20
Southern California
Edison to dig up evidence of market power abuse.

But the state=01,s biggest transporter of gas to California -- El Paso Natu=
ral=20
Gas -- is not
ready to take the rap. The pipeline has commissioned its own study, which i=
t=20
recently presented
as evidence that it has not circumvented any laws or regulation.

As reported in both the trade press and national media, SoCal Ed and the CP=
UC=20
are pointing
the finger of blame at El Paso for alleged manipulation of California borde=
r=20
prices through
affiliate deals and capacity hoarding. And exhibit A in their case against =
El=20
Paso is The Brattle
Group=01,s study of the California market.

Richard Zeiger, a spokesman for Assembly Member Darrell Steinberg, chairman=
=20
of the
California Assembly Judiciary Committee, told Gas Daily that The Brattle=20
Group=01,s market
study proved that the surge in gas prices at the California border was not=
=20
caused by normal
market forces (GD 4/20). His remarks followed an oversight hearing during=
=20
which Assembly
members questioned Dynegy and El Paso officials about their involvement in=
=20
the California
market.

El Paso presented a different version of events to the Assembly. In a repor=
t=20
presented to
legislators, a research group hired by El Paso concluded that a convergence=
=20
of factors, not a
conspiracy, caused the price run-up.

Lukens Consulting Group, a Houston-based consultancy, was retained by El Pa=
so=20
to conduct
work on several fronts. In its study of the California market, Lukens=20
concluded that the
increasing convergence of the gas and electricity businesses was one of the=
=20
main culprits in the
California gas price imbroglio.

Assemblyman John Campbell, a Republican member of the oversight committee,=
=20
said he
""didn=01,t see any smoking gun"" in either report.

""We had our committee hearing, and we certainly had a lot on the Brattle=20
Study and a little
on the Lukens study. To some degree, I=01,m not sure that the California=20
legislature is the best
place to adjudicate the differences between these two studies,"" Campbell=20
said. ""I believe FERC
is looking at this situation "" and it would seem to me that that=01,s the=
=20
appropriate place.""

Campbell said that the CPUC had been prodding the California legislature to=
=20
give support
to its claims of market power abuse by pipelines. ""It=01,s being pushed=20
basically by the Public
Utilities Commission here, which believes that there was collusion"" by=20
pipeline companies to
push up gas prices in California, he said.

The CPUC, Campbell suggested, sought satisfaction before the California=20
assembly when
it had failed on the federal level: ""There=01,s a concerted effort, not jus=
t on=20
natural gas but on other
things here in California, for entities and organizations here to point the=
=20
finger elsewhere for
the problems that we=01,re having in this state and I think you=01,re seein=
g some=20
of that with the
public utilities commission.""

Whether either report wins over the public incensed by high natural gas=20
prices is a different
matter entirely. In the meanwhile, the dueling California market studies se=
em=20
to have taken
on a life of their own.

The Brattle Group Study, for instance, has become the center of a heavily=
=20
litigated effort to
force FERC to compel the release of market data by California market=20
participants. Following
on a request by SoCal Ed, which said it needed additional data to round out=
=20
The Brattle Group
report, FERC Chief ALJ Curtis Wagner issued subpoenas to the other three=20
major pipelines that
serve the state as well as to Sempra Energy Trading.

Several parties resisted FERC=01,s call for market information, saying the=
=20
requested data
contained commercially sensitive information. FERC allowed the discovery=20
process to move
forward but only after attaching strict data protection rules restricting=
=20
access to evidence
(GD 4/23).

Critics of the pipeline industry have already suffered one setback in their=
=20
case. The commission
recently dismissed the CPUC=01,s claim that El Paso rigged the auction of a=
=20
large block of
pipeline capacity in favor of affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy. In=20
addressing the California
Assembly, representatives of Dynegy said that FERC=01,s recent ruling on th=
e=20
California border
controversy obviated the need for more investigation.

The controversy, however, is far from over. FERC last month also ordered a=
=20
hearing into
whether El Paso Natural Gas and its affiliates manipulated capacity to driv=
e=20
up the price of gas
delivered into California (GD 3/29). That hearing is likely to take place=
=20
this summer. (RP00-

indexes taht already exist in OEL, so no new Mexican Indices will be 
included.   Please note however, that the mexican gas is priced in Mexico on 
the basis of the Tetco/Valero basket. So, most probably, that same basket

Hi Iris

I have two different hats to wear in talking to Enron.  One is as a
financial economist.  The other as the Director of the newly formed ""Global
Mobility Innovation Initiative (GMII) -- this is the research project
funded by Lucent, involving BU, LBS, and INSEAD, to study various aspects
of the mobile Internet (read 3G).

On the former I am working with a couple of Ph.D. students in understanding

(a) details of how having physical supply (inventory) can be used by a
market maker.   This is a problem that has been studies in the context of
specialists inventory in the stock market but I think really interesting in
the way Enron does it in some of the newer markets like bandwidth.    I
think this is a big issue in lighting up all the dark fiber  that is in the
ground.

(b) how Enron is disciplining the internal decision making process with
market.  This is in many ways the critical aspect of  real options that
most finance people miss -- having options is one thing but exercising them
and realizing their value is another.  All of the incomplete contracting,
asymmetric information, and incentive issues are ignored in real options
valuation models.  But they are real in practice.  My impression is Enron's
real success is in putting place an organization that is able to mitigate
these problems by imposing a market disciplining.

(c) how Enron manages the various books that involve physicals, financials,
credit etc.  This is specially important when many of the real assets have
options features and therefore, include non-linear risk profiles.  The
story of gas  is pretty well understood but not many of the others markets
Enron has been moving into over the last few years.

On the GMII front, I think that some interesting opportunities arise when
you think of the spectrum in a way similar to that of dark fiber.   I am
working with several people at Lucent on this issue.  I think it would be
wonderful to engage in a conversation with Enron and Lucent folks in the room.

I can do a lunch time talk on any of these issues.  Perhaps we can discuss
some of these over a conference call. Clearly, having Vince Kaminski in the
room would be very important to me.

As for schedules, the first 3 weeks of April are horrible.  April 26/27,
May 3/4 are good for me.

Regards

Nalin

the language for the amendment that deals with the confirm clean-up.

2. We need to know from MEGA and Morgan what the transfer effective date is 
that establishes the cutoff date for these trades as between ourselves and 
each of Morgan and MEGA.  My revised draft of the Consent makes it clearer 
how this cutoff date works.

3. We need a contact from Morgan that we can send the form of amendment to.

Call me if you have any questions.

Subject: Deal Entry:  New Version


Hi Everyone,

There is a new version of Deal Entry (Ver. 2.6.6.58)  in stage that needs to 
be User Acceptance Tested.

The changes were actually for Australia (wrong date/time showing, problem 
with EOL) and London (fix to default settings).
These changes should actually be invisible to Houston so you should see no 
difference between the way it was working before and now.

Please test the application (as you would normally use it) and let me know 
(by way of email or phone call) if Deal Entry is working well, and can be 
migrated to Production.  We are hoping to release it to Prod by this evening, 
(January 12, 2001).


Thanks,

Elizabeth/Paul:

Please find attached my markup of the Draft Power Sale Agreement with New 
Hampshire Electric Coop.  I have added some important language in Article 
14.2 to reflect that Installed Capability will still be credited by ISO-NE 
even during an outage at Seabrook (i.e., they should have full liability for 
providing ICAP regardless of whether the plant is operating).  The rest of my 
comments should be pretty clear.

We need to have comments to NHEC by noon eastern time, Monday March 13th.  
Please call me at 978-449-9936 to discuss.  Thanks much.

When the contract is fully executed, just forward it to me in interoffice

under and the name that the deals are under in Enpower.  Sierra Pacific 
Industries, Inc. is in global counterparty and the deals have been changed in 
Enpower to this CP.  The problem is that the contract and the confirms will 
not agree as to who is the correct CP.  We have always confirmed deals under 
the name of the entity with whom we have a contract.  Please let me know if 
the name will be changed on the contract to reflect the correct CP or will we 
amend the contract to add ""Inc."" to the end of the name and set up this dba 
in global counterparty.  I need to know before we can confirm these deals.

In additiona, Geir has entered a transmission deal for this CP.  578812.  
Should this be a buy/resale?

first part of this week, and her voice mail referred me to Melissa. (That's a

Anyway, following is the information connected with the new counterparty name 
Chris Foster has requested:

Name: Sierra Pacific Holding Company, dba Sierra Pacific Industries

I also have a copy of the Master Power Purchase and Sale Agreement if you'd 
like me to fax that over. Just let me know how I can help. We've already 
entered Chris's deal into the system with ""New Counterparty,"" so the sooner 
we can change that the better.

		 Subject: Dayrate Cap Indicative Proposal to Noble Drilling

Dear Mark Taylor,

Please review the language below; it is a first attempt at making a non 
binding proposal to Noble Drilling.  Please return your approved language 
asap.

Thanks
John A. Peyton



Dear Mark Mey,

We appreciate your interest in our new dayrate financial products.  

For your consideration, we would like to indicatively propose a transaction 
in which Enron North America would purchase a Financial Call Option (""Cap"") 
from Noble Drilling Corporation for the Calculation Period  April 1, 2001 
through June 30, 2001 for one Rig.  The Strike Price would be $65,000 per 
(Rig*Day) and the premium which we would pay to Noble Drilling Corporation 
(within Five Business Days of the Trade Date) would be US Dollars $200,000.

The Commodity Reference Price would be the arithmetic mean of the high and 
low Rig Day Rates for JU-300'-IC as published by Offshore Data Services, 
Inc., or its successor, in the last issue of Gulf of Mexico Weekly Rig 
Locator, or any successor publication, published during the applicable 
Calculation Period, on the page entitled ""Gulf of Mexico Rig Utilization and 
Day Rates"".  The Payment Date(s) would be the fifth (5th) Business Day 
following the date on which the Floating Price is determinable.

We have authority to enter into the above this type of transaction and would 
be able to move quickly toward providing you with an executable contract.  
Because the market for dayrates is highly volatile [and because we may have 
made similar proposals to other counterparties] (is this true?), this 
indicative proposal is only good until August 31st, 2000.  We look forward to 
further discussions. 

This document contains indicative terms only and is not intended to create a 
binding or enforceable contract nor is it an offer or commitment to enter 
into any transaction.  All terms are subject to change until agreement as to 
a specific transaction has been reached.  ENA is not acting as a fiduciary or 
advisor and you should evaluate and understand the terms, conditions, and 
risks of all transactions in making your decisions with respect thereto.  The 
proposal described herein is subject to further review and approval by ENA 
and Counterparty and, among other matters, further review and approval of the 
board of directors of each party, and the negotiations, execution and 
delivery of definitive agreements containing all appropriate provisions, 
including those related to credit, limitations of damages and others.

Sincerely,

"As we discussed last week, ECT is sending a demand letter to Sonoco for the 
underpayment of $60,000.  I need the attachment which I have identified as 
merely Exhibit ""A"" to appear on a single sheet of paper (legal is fine).  We 
discussed your revision to cover the entire term of the swap AND revisions to 
the month of January, 1999 to reflect ECT's floating price as .33 (which will 
cause changes to the invoice amount and difference columns).  Also, instead 
of the term ""Sonoco Price"", I would prefer the caption ""Floating Price 
recognized by Sonoco"".  Please call if you have questions.  Thanks. Sara   "

Carol,

1. We have set up the Master User from Aquila Risk under Utilicorp.  We do 
not require any further paperwork from them, however, we do need them to set 
up their sub-users.  I am going to follow up with Angela Webber at Utilicorp 
tomorrow to make sure that sub users are set up.

2. I will notify you once sub-user accounts have been set up and then wait 
for your instructions as to when we will shut Aquila Risk down for trading.

Thanks,
Stephanie x33465

Subject: Utilicorp

Stephanie and Frank:
Both Susan Bailey and I have spoken with Utilicorp's attorney and here is my 
understanding of where things stand:

1. On Friday, it was my understanding that they submitted their password 
application and that the problem was that the person that they needed to set 
up the sub-user passwords was not in the office.  My understanding is that he 
will be in on Tuesday and that is when they are going to try to set up those 
accounts.  Does that require them to send any paperwork to us?

2. Once the sub-user accounts are set up, then we need to pick a date for the 
Transfer Agreement to become effective.  Since we are changing the date from 
June 16th, this will require someone from Utilicorp to initial the change and 
their attorney wasn't sure when that will happen.  Once the new date is 
picked and initialed, then we can begin trading under Utilicorp's name, but 
nothing should be done until before then.  Either Susan or I will let you 
know when that date is.

Please call me at 33989 if you have any questions.
Carol

This analysis was another swag at p&l components. We took the numbers from the daily position reports, backed out the big originations that we new about (e.g. peakers sales) and the other ""mistakes"" (e.g. the EES $700MM loss), then took out the curve-shift P&L from the backtest data, the balance we said must be some form of ""new deal"" P&L plus realised p&l etc.
It shows that 2000 was the prop trading year, whereas 2001 was mainly new deals. Of course the whole thing is poisoned by reserve movements.

"Greetings.  Please forgive me for not getting back to you more promptly.  Here's the latest:

As you know, I'm finishing up my MBA at Berkelely (I'll have but one class left to take next semester!).  Finals/projects, etc. are all done/due, etc. next week, so as you can imagine it's very crazy.
In addition, I (we) had to put the sweetest dog in the world to sleep this week, and the Enron thing's been nothing compared to that.
(I'd ask, ""what next?"", but I'm afraid to ask.....)
However, none of this constitutes an excuse for not getting back to you, so I apologize.
OK, back to Enron.
It's a mess (surprise).
I'm still with the company--not sure for how long, however.  At least through the end of the year, it appears.
Sue and Joseph have left.  If you'd like their contact information, I'd be happy to provide it.
We're trying to transfer our DA contracts to other ESPs, but the utilities, Carl Wood and some others want to make it difficult, if not impossible.
Though difficult as it may seem to believe, I'm actually doing OK (engaging in lots of zen buddist stuff) and I do promise to give each of you a ring to catch up very soon.
This week's a little tough just because with school and ""the mess,"" I'm a tad preoccupied.
HOWEVER, your calls and nice thoughts are extremely welcomed and greatly appreciated.  Thanks so much.

Will talk to you soon and hope you're doing well.

Best,
Jeff"
"I do know Jana.  She has worked in various positions within my group for 
years since she joined us in the analyst program.  She has not been the 
strongest player.  Her level of accuracy has not been what we would have 
liked in many of the roles that she has played for us (confirmations and 
settlements).  And despite feedback, she is one of those players that just 
has never quite viewed her performance level in the same light that we see 
it.  She currently supports trading operations for South America, reporting 
to Martha Stevens under Scott Mills.  Let me check with Scott on his thoughts 
about her current performance and on her in an HR role.  I will let you know 
what he thinks.  It may be to date that we just haven't had Jana in the right 
role for her.  If I remember correctly, she was originally a teacher who went 
back to school to get a business degree.  Very sweet, pleasant to work with 
and personable.  I will get back with you after I have talked with Scott, or 
I may have him leave you a message.

would like to talk Tuesday evening.  However, I'm in Austin all day and
into the evening on Wednesday and off to New Orleans early thursday

p.s. I just got a case study written by some guys at Darden (U. of Va.) on
Enron that I am copying and shipping off to you.  they have done all the
""heavy lifting"" for details so all we need do is determine our focus and
write up our paper.

collect on unpaid debts, for which there are very limited defenses. The 
likelihood of success on the defenses of these cases is small."
"Ernie,  Thanks for taking care of that.   I will probably be getting into 
Austin earlier than you.  I'll have my cell phone with me.  (281) 772-9250.  
If you get into town earlier, give me a call.  Otherwise why don't you just 
call me at the room when you get to the hotel.   Sounds great, we'll ride 
over together.  I might bring this girl I have kinda been seeing with me.  My 
latest victim.  We'll see.    I believe that's correct.  The wedding is at 7.

Thanks for the Dilliards tip.  I was going to ask about that.

Gerald,

Good news - we were able to get the second room at the same $129 rate.  Below
you'll see two separate confirmation numbers - I don't think it matters which
one you or I use.  When you check in, just claim one of them.  They're both on
my card so you can transfer to yours at check-in.

I'm not sure what time we'll get there since we'll be coming from SA.  I
estimate we'll get there at about 5:00 (the wedding is at 7:00 right?)  We'll
actually be traveling to SA on Friday since some of Jill's family from the
Valley will be there as well.

If we're not in contact before then, let's just plan on meeting at the hotel
sometime between 6:00 and 6:30.  We can drive over to the wedding together 
from
there.

In case you didn't know, they're registered at Dillard's - we got him a gift
yesterday, still plenty of items on the list.

"Couple of thoughts:

In light of all the events that have transpired yesterday and today, seems 
that the IOUs have decided to up the ante considerably (likely in response to 
a pounding they're taking from Wall Street). This will likely increase the 
pressure for Davis to act sooner rather than later, at least w.r.t. finding a 
way out of the IOU undercollection problem.   The increased pressure to act 
in turn increases the likelihood that a bad solution will emerge.   Regarding 
the call on Monday with Davis, the added heat being applied might argue for 
coming up with a simple, concrete proposal that we can hand to Davis and that 
he can implement immediately to get the IOUs off his back and avoid having 
the adminstration cook up something less preferable."

I tried to call you about 30 minutes ago (together with my credit guys).  We 
would really like to chat today.  I have a meeting that will last about an

Hi Sara,
Thanks for the update.  With respect to First Union Corp., the holding
company of First Union National Bank (""FUNB"")  providing a guaranty, I don't
believe that's an option. FUNB is a rated entity and as mentioned in my Jan.
23rd email, we can provide quarterly call reports (with year-to-date
information), which is also available on the FDIC page (www.fdic.gov). First
Union Corporation's consolidated annual financial statements are available
on EDGAR as well as First Union's home page (www.firstunion.com).  I look
forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.  It seems that our
marketers are asking for credit approval to enter into the Shenandoah trade
today without the Master in place. If approval is given, we will need mutual
downgrade provisions in our confirm.  I think all other pending trades are
on hold until we can get our docs wrapped up.

"I am attaching a revised draft notice of intent to exercise the purchase 
option for the equipment for the CA transactions. We need two separate 
notices - one for CA I and one for CA II.  Ben/Fred/Rebecca, could you please 
prepare a draft of the two exhibits?
 
Lisa/Catherine/Rose, I revised the form of notice to make it track the 
participation agreement and the development and construction management 
agreement.  

I've tentatively dated the notice as of this Friday.  By my calculations, 
Monday is our drop dead date since a waiver of the 5 day period is not an 
option, and the deal dies if not closed by the 15th.  

Ben mentioned that I should be drafting a ""release letter"" for the banks 
and/or DevCo. It would be a big help if someone could point me to the section 
in the documents which set forth the requirements of the release, since I'm 
still wading through it all and haven't found the relevant language yet.  
Also, please advise of the results of the conference call which you had with 
the lenders (?) and/or their lawyers regarding the issue.

I am working on the assignment and assumption agreement.

Hi Tana -

We are trying to put in place an ISDA Master Agreement between Enron 
Australia Finance Pty Ltd and Enron Capital & Trade Resources International 
Corp (Singapore Branch).    Enron Australia has already signed on the 
document. Can we send it to you to help us get the necessary signatures for 
ECTRIC (Singapore Branch)?

I have prepared the following documents but not sure if they are most up to 
date:

1. Certificate of Assistant Secretary

2. Certificate of Secretary

3. Unanimous Consent of Directors (this is incomplete cos I am not sure of 
the part starting from RESOLVED ..)


Is there any other documents that I have missed out?  Would appreciate your 
help and guidance whether I have done the above correctly.  If there is 
anything incorrect, please guide me accordingly.





Many thanks

Here is where things stand on Engage:

1.  Engage Energy US LP - Luke and I have agreed on the new draft of 
amendment.   The Credit Support Provider will be Coastal.  Luke is sending me 
their form of Guaranty which I will take a look at.  It will cover just the 
Engage Energy US financial transactions and have a cap of $10,000,000 

2. Engage Energy Canada LP - It will stay as currently written although the 
Guaranty from Westcoast will have now a cap of $10,000,000 and only cover the 
Engage Canada financial transactions.

I need to make some minor chnages to the Engage US amendment and then it will 
be ready and you can coordinate with Luke in getting it executed.

"Nancy,

Below are the recipes for the party.  The only commitment I have so far is 
for the meat dish, so everything else is up for grabs.  Let me know which one 
you are making.

The directions to my house are as follows:

1.  Take 59 and exit Greenbriar like you are going to Church
2.  First light is Bissonnet, make a left on Bissonnet.
3.  Stay on Bissonnet for about 1/2 mile.  On the right you will see a gray 
apartment complex called ""Maryland Manor"".  The street right there is 
""Ashby"", make a right on Ashby.
4.  The first left is Wroxton Court.  I am in the upstairs of the duplex at 
1714 Wroxton Court, but you probably will just want to walk around to the 
back yard.

My phone no. is case there are any problems is (713) 529-1038.  I look 
forward to seeing you there!

Hi everyone:

I've attached the recipes for the May 13th Church Gourmet Dinner.  They are in
Word, but please let me know if you have problems with the attachments.  I can
convert them or fax them to you.  I have made notes on the recipes regarding
the advisability of doubling some of them for a party of more than 8 guests.

At the bottom of this email, you can still review Alicia's original
instructions and comments about the parties (and the guest lists as they stand
now).

My only thoughts about dividing up the recipes among your guests are:

1.  Remind everyone to bring a bottle of wine for the group.

2.  The dessert recipe should perhaps not be given to a single male as it
requires a springform pan (an item I'm guessing is not common to most bachelor
kitchens).

3.  The person(s) to bring the soup should also bring bread.

4.  Remind the people doing the main course to do a mixture of pork & chicken.

Let me know if you have any questions!

Penny

"I'm sorry, but I can't give you full credit on your answer to the second part 
of my question. The correct answer was the author's use of the word 
""stunning"" to describe the $6.2 billion figure. The word is clearly an 
editorialization on the amount of the refund requested, and is therefore 
journalistically incorrect.  In addition, you failed to extemporize on why a 
journalist for an energy trade magazine would leave such gaping holes in 
his/her story. 

But because I'm feeling lenient this morning, I'll give you the details.

a great time.  Mom said that she might want to fix noodle soup on Mothers 
Day.  That would be great.  We can supplement with sausage or hamburgers on

things, and then some things just don't seem to register.  She seemed 
confused about whether Bettye had been their for Easter.  Is this normal, 
what type of medication is the doctor having her take to combat the loss of 
memory?  Maybe we can all get together Mothers Day and visit.  Email me back 
please."

Dear Vince,

As you may know, FERC approved the Neptune transmission proposal on July 26
and the organizers (me among them) are now preparing to hold on open season
starting September 10 to sell 80 percent of the capacity on a firm basis. A
diagram of the system legs is on www.NeptuneRTS.com.

Some of the bidders in that open season will be gencos with little or no
experience in trading, some will be load-serving entities, some will be
power marketers.

There is likely to be interest in a Neptune hedge, and I wondered how we
could engage Enron in an exploration of its willingness to provide such
hedges. Essentially, bidders will be going long the various spreads (Nova
Scotia - New York, New Brunswick - Boston, PSE&G - Zone J, etc etc) and we
would like to encourage someone like Enron (I know there is no one quite
like Enron but you know what I mean) to be willing to offer transmission
hedges.

It may also interest you that FERC gave Neptune approval to hold 20 percent
of the capacity for sale in the short-term markets. We (the development
group) see that as a desirable exposure to these spreads for Neptune's
equity investors and are in the equity markets now securing a second tranche
of development capital, and will return in early 2002 for a sizeable amount
of permanent equity assuming the bids received in September - October yield
sufficient interest to finance the majority of the project in the debt
market.

That's the plan, the primary virtue of which is that the authorities have
allowed us to put it to a market test this fall. Let me know if you'd like
to pursue this. I will make similar initiatives to several other entities
later this week.

"No.  The decision would have prevented the Commission from implementing the 
legislation that prohibits direct access, at least during the time that 
Legislature and the direct access coalition work together to try to come up 
with a compromise to continue to allow direct access.  So all this means is 
that the prohibition still has not been implemented and there currently is 
nothing before the commission to implement.  Sure would have been nice if the 
commission had passed it, though.

Also, did I tell you that i'm in a meeting all day tomorrow in houston and 
therefore can't do an update call with edward's?  i can, however, do it on

Subject: PUC Approves DWR Language in Decision; Removes Language Staying 
Commission Action on Direct Access

The Commission just voted out one half of the ""Bilas Alternate.""

The decision that got voted out included Bilas' DWR-based language stating 
that the PUC 1) would not second-guess DWR purchases and 2) would pass 
through DWR costs to customers.
However, in a move led by Commissioner Carl Wood, the decision removed the 
Bilas language on Direct Access.  The decision therefore did NOT include the 
Bilas language staying any Commission action on implementing the Direct 
Access prohibition.  Carl Wood called including Direct Access ""the height of 
arrogance.""  
The decision was voted out 3-2, with the 2 remaining Republicans dissenting.
That said, the Commission has no proposal before it implementing the 
prohibition, and there was no talk at the meeting of implementing the 
prohibition any time soon.

Best,
Jeff

Dear Ms. Geman,

I met with Vince Kaminski yesterday regarding picking back up with the 
license agreement we were working on back in March.  He relayed some 
additional requirements which need to be added to the agreement, which 
include the following:

 1. The price agreed upon is $90,000.
 2. D-G will provide system support.
3. No later than 12 months of execution of the agreement, D-G will provide 
the source code to Enron.  In the meantime, the source code is to be in 
escrow.  Additionally, the source code would be released sooner than the 12 
months if any of the following conditions occur:  (i) D-G goes out of 
business; (ii) D-G is unable to provide effective technical support; or (iii) 
if D-G agrees to release it sooner.

Before I have our attorney add these things to the agreement, we need to 
discuss the escrow situation.  Vince mentioned that you had suggested that 
your attorney keep the software in escrow.   Is your attorney a U.S. 
attorney?  It seems like I may have recalled that way back in March you might 
have said you had a friend or relative that was an attorney.  Is that the 
same person?  Does this attorney work for a large firm, small firm, or solo 
practitioner?  Basically, if you could just provides some additional 
information about your attorney, I would appreciate it.

We normally would use an Escrow company to put the software in escrow.  We 
have dealt with a company here in the U.S. called DSI Technology.  I will 
check into that pending your answer regarding your attorney.

Once we decide what we want to do regarding placing the software in escrow, 
we will red-line the agreement to reflect such changes and e-mail it back to 
you for your review.

I look forward to hearing from you.

		 Subject: Peace Targetting Market Players

FYI.  Just got a call from Jan Smutney-Jones.  Apparently, word is on the 
street that Peace intends to begin targeting Enron as an example of the 
""misconduct"" that Peace alleges has occured in California's markets.  Smutney 
thinks Peace may be keying off the comments of the ""unnamed"" trader in the 
Dow article claiming that Enron's been buying power and holding on to it.  
Apparently Peace's other angle is/will be:  ""The same people who colluded in 
the design of this market are now colluding to profit unfairly from it.""  No 
idea of when and how Peace might launch any attacks.  Two immediate thoughts:

Apart from the bad reporting in the Dow article, that article shows that 
Enron got beat by, among others, two federal (Canada and the US), one state 
(SRP) and one municipal (LADWP) government.
David Freeman, who now heads up LADWP, was appointed ""Czar"" by the State of 
California and charged with the task of implementing Steve Peace's brain 
child (AB 1890).  Freeman set up the ISO and PX market structures.  He also 
set up the Governing Boards."

-----Original Message-----
From: McEvoy, Bridget [mailto:Bridget.McEvoy@ElPaso.com]
BN  18:06 Talks Between California, Generators End; No Accord (Correct)

(Corrects lead to say judge recommended FERC hearings to

result disagreements; adds comments from judge in fifth paragraph

and comments from Enron in 13th paragraph.)

 

     Washington, July 9 (Bloomberg) -- A judge who oversaw two

weeks of unsuccessful negotiations aimed at persuading power

sellers to pay refunds in California and other western states

recommended that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission hold

hearings to resolve disagreements within 60 days.

     Two weeks of FERC-ordered talks ended today with the two

sides no closer to an accord.

     ``In 15 days, you can't work miracles,'' said Curtis Wagner,
FERC's chief administrative law judge. ``The numbers were too far

apart.''

      California says it is due a refund of $8.9 billion because

the companies charged excessive prices. Other western states are

also requesting money.

     A group of power sellers offered $510 million to California

during the negotiations, scoffing at the state's method of

calculating the refund, Wagner said. Other parties to the talks

offered about $206 million, bringing the total offer from

generators to $716 million.

      On Saturday, the state brought in analysts who explained how

the state calculated its estimate. He wasn't convinced by

California's arguments that it should receive $8.9 billion, said

Wagner, who wouldn't provide his own estimate of how much should

be paid.

     Wagner said FERC should hold hearings of 60 days or less and

should calculate a refund based on a system it approved for price

caps on June 18. The caps are based on the costs of the highest

priced generator during the early stages of a power shortage.

      That formula should be applied retroactively to Oct. 1,

Wagner said. He wouldn't provide an estimate of the size of such a

refund, saying it would require research into fuel prices from

that time period.

     Michael Kahn, California's chief negotiator, said the judge's

recommendation was a victory for his state. Wagner's formula would

give his state a refund of ``several billion dollars,'' and

California will sue to get the rest, he said.

     ``The judge said we're entitled to our money without

releasing any of our claims,'' Kahn told reporters.

     Generators were mixed on what Wagner's recommendations meant,

though they agreed the state asked for too much.

    ``Under the faulty methodology the state has come up with (to

justify the $8.9 billion refund), we would be owed money because

we bought more than we sold in the spot market in the period in

question,'' said Mark Palmer, a spokesman for Enron Corp, one of

the power sellers taking part in the negotiations. ``That's shows

how ridiculous this is.''

    Houston-based Enron didn't participate in the offer to refund

$510 million, Palmer said, without being more specific.

     ``Nothing I've seen suggests that California cares about a

settlement,'' Palmer said. ``What they care about is shifting

blame. What they care about is a witch hunt.''

     Duke Energy Corp. is ``very pleased'' by the judge's

recommendations, said Brent Bailey, vice president and general

counsel of the Charlotte-based company. The judge's plan fixes

problems with California's methodology for calculating the

refunds, he said.

      California's two biggest utilities have piled up almost $14

billion in debt because of the surging prices that resulted when

the state's plan to deregulate its electricity system failed. The

state began buying power on the utilities' behalf in January and

has spent close to $8 billion.

Hello Chris!

I was writing to give you some good news and bad news.

Bad news:  I am getting laid off.  I transferred to Columbus with Clinton.  They are laying off half their staff.

I am not real fond of Columbus and hope to move back to Houston one day.  Hopefully we can work together again one day.

Hope all is well with you!

Take care!

Susan

In response to your email, yes, our confidentiality language was so limited 
that it did not allow us to provide the agreement to affiliates of either 
party without consent.  We revised the form about 9 months ago to broaden the 
langage to include affiliates, but Duke is an old master so they need our 
consent so they can provide it to their affiliate.  Unless Federico has any 
reason not to waive the language, I think we can go ahead & draft a waiver up 
here and send it to Duke.  Can you talk to Federico asap and run that by him 
and let me know so I can get this over to Duke.  Thanks!

Subject: IPAA Short Term Forecast


GPCM Modelers,
Here's an article from Powermarketers.com regarding a recent IPAA short-run
forecast.  Note that the title is wrong.  The information in the article
implies a year 2001 22.56 tcf total US consumption not output (production).
 And, that consumption includes pipeline fuel and lease and plant fuel.
 Production in 2001 is est at 18.94 tcf (not sure whether marketed or dry,
but probably dry.)
It could be an interesting point of comparison for your own near term
forecasts.

I heard yesterday you have been out for quite a while sick.  I had no idea.  
What's the scoop?  Should I be worried?"
"Joe:
Here is my stab at a form of confirm reply letter.  This one assumes that we 
are the confirming party but it can be modified if the counterparty is the 
confirming party and we want to send this.  I will work on  modifying 
Southern's cover letter into something that we could send to our

Sara,

P&G (largest buyer of pulp and linerboard in orth America) has received Board 
approval to financially hedge pulp using OTCs instruments.  They want to put 
an ISDA in place with Enron.  I will be the contact for the business group.  

P&G's lawyer, Libby Rutherford, has requested that we start where we left 
off.  I told their business representatives that we preferred starting from 
scratch but that you would contact her directly to discuss.  Her number is 
513-983-2513 and e-mail is rutherford.em@pg.com.    

Susan Bailey compared the 1999 negotiated document to our latest schedule for 
our review - see below.  Please give me a call to discuss when you get a 
chance ext 30418.  Thanks.

Ed,

Attached is blacklined version comparing ENA's latest version (dated 
8/9/2000), which was sent to Roger Larsh @ P&G and the version dated 
5/25/99.  The biggest difference between the two versions is that the 
8/9/2000 version includes (a) ENA's newest changes, and (b) the inclusion of 
a credit support annex.

Hope this helps.

                      Attorney-Client Privileged Communication


Since litigation has begun with Sempra, Somerset and Blue Grass, we should
see to it that documents relating to the issues in the lawsuit are
preserved.  For this purpose documents include not only hard copy but also
documents and information in electronic form and on voice or video
recordings.
It may well be that you will have questions on how to implement this
practice and more specifically what documents are covered. My suggestion is
that we start by trying to see that documents are not discarded and
determining what questions and issues there are.  Feel free to contact me
for guidance as you go forward.  It may well be that we should have a
conference call to see that everyone  is using the same procedures and to
address common issues.  If you think that would be desirable let me know.
We also need to see that other people who should get this notice have it
forwarded to them so that Enron's compliance is complete.

Subject: Clearing User Meetings

I have attached the e-mail that Ron Nolte sent to the Deal Clearing user 
community regarding the meeting
that is scheduled for November 16-17.   Please note that this is a meeting 
organized by the IT community, not
the user community.

As you may remember, Stephen Schwarz organized a similar meeting last fall in 
order to provide the IT group
with an agenda of what projects the user community considered to be priority 
projects.  However, the arrival of
EOL greatly altered the IT resources available to concentrate on those 
priority projects.  Today, the deal 
clearing community is struggling to get IT resources due to new systems such 
as ClickPaper.com, Commodity
Logic, project Thunderball  and a new weather capture and confirmation 
system.  This has created some internal 
conflict since each user group supported by the IT deal clearing applications 
group is requesting that their projects 
be set as the top priority project.  

This is a quick outline of the challenges facing both the deal clearing user 
community and the IT group supporting
this group.  I would be happy to discuss any questions you have about either 
the meeting or these challenges.

I took your bike by Bikesport on Saturday and was going to leave it and the

He aired up the tires and all I need to do is get on it and ride it!!!

Thanks for this and all of the prior updates.  Thanks als for the calls last week, or was it the week prior.  The last couple of weeks have been brutal.  Hopefully things get better from here.

I have been leaving the day to day management of the ees/iso situation in the capable hands of steve hall and jeff richter.  So far so good, although I hope that the ees sales team can get a deal done soon.

I'm taking the next couple of days off.  I'll call you towards the end of the week t catch up.  Sorry I've been so hard to reach.

I hope that you are hanging in there.

Kay:

We have enclosed the most recent drafts of the following ""prototype""
documents:

1.  Letter Agreement for the turbine transaction;
2.  Letter Agreement for the transformer transaction
3.  Limited Liability Company Agreement fur the turbine/transformer
transaction.

These documents were last revised on 12/15/2000.  Since that time, we made a
number of changes to the letter agreement in the InterGen transaction that
you might also wish to consider for the prototype.  These items include (i)
provisions for submission and approval of the facility agreement, (ii)
requirement that the entire purchase price be funded into escrow upon
approval of the facility agreement, (iii) pro-ration of property taxes, (iv)
requirement for liability insurance through date of commercial operation,
and (v) tweaks in the termination language that would provide a right to
terminate, rather than automatic termination.  Let me know if we can be of
any assistance.  Thank you.

		 Subject: Hendricks


The complaint,albeit brief, filed May 1 in San Diego Superior Court by 
Strategy Integration, Inc versus Michael Aguirre and the other Hendricks  
plaintiffs' attorneys is quite extraordinary in its disclosure. A hard copy 
is being faxed. The expert firm alleges they were ""retained...to explain, 
research, and investigate potential claims of gaming and collusion by energy 
providers who supply electricity to the California Energy Market ...[and] 
...retained to perform utility and energy consulting services."" After 
alleging that the Hendricks attorneys ""refused to pay Plaintiffs' first 
billing""  it is alleged that""defendants' refusal may have resulted from the 
conclusions Plaintiff drew in its analysis."" We should consider if there is 
there a way to get this filing to Senator Dunn's office or a more friendly 
Senator  without identifying us as the source,.They can see what some expert 
in the field  hired by the plaintiffs'  class action lawyers apparently 
concluded on their own about the claims of gaming and collusion. I suspect 
that  Sen Dunn has no interest but some Republican Senator might have some 
use for it. It could  have some value if the hearings go forward. This is not 
urgent timewise but I wanted to bring it to your attention.

Subject: Sutton Bridge swaps

Hi, Trena!  I am working again with Gary's desk now that Shari has moved on 
to power trading (legal).  My first task has been to reconcile the 
outstanding Sutton Bridge transactions.  I find three:

(1)  Currency Swap between ECT and Sutton Bridge Financing Ltd:  booked 
5/22/97 [ 12/31/97 through 6/30/22]

(2)  Currency Swap between ECT and Sutton Bridge Power booked 1/28/97 [ 
through 4/29/11]

(3)  Currency Swap between ""ECT"" and ""Sutton Bridge"" booked 3/29/00 [ through 
3/31/03].  I have only seen the ticket and not the confirm.

I understand that all swap transactions are to be terminated with the pending 
Sutton Bridge sale.  Are you terminating these three (3) trades?  Are there 
others?  What is the third trade which was booked last week (I don't know 
anything about it)?  Someone should be documenting the termination and 
payout.  Please let me know ASAP as the lawyers are headed to San Antonio 
tomorrow.  Thanks.  Sara (X35620)

I just spoke with Koury and he was anything but reasonable.  He has already
filed an application in the Iowa courts for guardianship and conservatorhip
of Alexis, even though the Iowa Code gives parental preference, which is a
difficult preference to overcome.  Also, the Iowa court doesn't have
jurisdiction until Texas says it does.  He said he told you about some case
he took to the Iowa Supreme Court where the Court granted a grandfather
possession and conservatorship over the father who was an out of state
resident.  Do you remember that?

Paul and Jeff,

Becky, Donna and I (gas girls) met with Phillip Allen (ENA West) to discuss FERC gas issues today, and Phillip had some issues that were more state than federal, and I told him I would bring them to your attention.

He is interested in seeing incentive rates or more hedging on the part of the CA LDC's so that all their needs are not being served by the spot market.  In the current market, hedges (longer term contracting and financial) are being done primarily by the producers and marketers, which results in a thin and probably off-kilter market (the LDCs buying for the customers are not participating).  I know we have to square this with the EES positions, but I am not up to speed on what is going on in CA on this issue.

Phillip also made that point that while the LDCs are focusing on their core load, no one is doing system planning on the macro basis, taking into account the ability of the physical systems to meet the needs of all customers, core and non-core and making sure the system will be adequate.

Finally, he is very interested in seeing the CA LDC rates unbundled.

Any updates we can provide to Phillip (and the gas girls) would be appreciated, as well as what our plans are to address these issues.

From our side, El Paso is having a conference in July and we will be taking up a number of allocation and transportation issues at that time.

Thanks.

"For now, have her boxes delivered to the spot behind your desk.  I sent Wes a 
message and copied you on that.  I can't remember the name of the person who 
works for Wes that handles moves.   Lisa filled in for her while she was out 
on medical leave.  She is back.  Can you get with her right away and see what 
you can come up with?  Best situation would be for Beth to sit near me.  

Also, Bob Hall has someone who is coordinating space needs for us now that 
Lisa is gone.  Can you check with her, too?  

Also, Jeff Shankman called me last week to ask how we could speed up our 
(Energy Ops) move off of 30.  I don't know who is left on 30.  Can you get 
the person that reports to Bob Hall to give me an update on our moves from 30 
so that I can get back with Jeff this week?  Thanks. --Sally

Hi Patti,

This will probably be the first of many emails in the next couple of weeks.

Do you have a location as to where Beth will be sitting over there?  We'll be 
packing up her boxes soon to ship over and for future post etc.

Also, she will need a new extension number.  She would most definately prefer 
an 853 number and if you can use her VP status to help her get one if they 
refuse (her words) then that would be great.  Her old number was 853-5521 
although someone else may have that now.

Thank you for your help.  It is very much appreciated.

"Just got word from EES, they can take the EOG gas.  Marde will show me a 
number after I find out if CES wants this or not.  Marde also said the seller 
pays a flat $100.00 to transfer gas out of their pool to EES's pool.  Marde 
said the nom for June would be done as an imbalance transfer and she paid IF 
+$.09 for gas this month.

EES cannot take any Peoples gas.  Should I have Scott Hendrickson try to sell 
it to Peoples?  I'm also going to leave a message for Paul at Clinton.  Marde 
is going to check around.

"FYI.
***********************************************************************
UC Pioneers Conservation 
Two decades of innovations prepared campuses for energy price crunch 
When the state's energy crisis hit, the University of California was not 
caught with its fans running full blast. 
Across the nine-campus UC system, $65 million has been spent over two decades 
on energy-saving devices, including new lighting, variable speed fans, even a 
system to harness waste gas from landfills to run boilers. 
So, with Gov. Gray Davis calling for every California household and business 
to cut electricity use by 10 percent, UC offers a good model of conservation. 
Despite rapid growth in the 178,000-student system in recent years, most 
campuses have held electricity consumption steady, and the university will 
net about $75 million in savings from the projects. 
""We are fortunate to have on the campuses people with the religion. They have 
been working on this agenda since the oil embargo,"" said Gary Matteson, UC 
director of energy and utilities planning. 
But UC will need to do more. Facing a 146 percent increase in the cost of 
natural gas -- which powers the co-generators that produce electricity -- the 
university is now asking the state for $217 million to fund additional 
conservation efforts. That way, UC could offset the increase in natural gas 
prices. 
As a state institution, UC has to reduce its electricity consumption by 8 
percent of its base load -- which is 334 megawatts at peak -- and by 20 
percent during Stage 2 alerts, when state electricity reserves fall below 5 
percent. UC has already exceeded the 8 percent reduction and Matteson said he 
expects the system to be ready to meet the 20 percent goal by June 1, before 
the summer peak hits. 
Like little cities, the campuses run around the clock, but laboratory lights 
that used to blaze continuously are now going dark when not needed, those in 
hallways have been dimmed or shut off when possible and the thermostats have 
been lowered. 
""I almost stumble through some of the hallways, it is so dark,"" said Keith 
Roberts, energy engineer at UC Davis. ""There are a lot of people who really 
want to help out. We are trying to do what we can without impacting the 
mission of the campus."" 
At many campuses, daily e-mail alerts remind students, as well as employees, 
to open their window shades to light and warm their rooms and offices during 
the day, and to shut off computers and lights when they are not in use. 
At UC Berkeley, freshman Jon Clingan, 18, said signs have been posted in the 
hallways and bathrooms of the residence halls, imploring students to save 
electricity in their rooms and even to cut short their showers. 
""I try to keep my light off as long as possible until it is just not possible 
to do work,"" Clingan said. 
In addition to conserving energy, UC protected itself against skyrocketing 
electricity prices by signing a four-year contract in 1998 -- along with the 
California State University system -- with Enron Corp to buy electricity at 
the 1996 rate minus 5 percent. In 1986, systemwide co-generation plants were 
installed to produce sufficient energy for most university buildings and to 
pump an additional 20 megawatts into the state's electricity grid. 
That approach saved most of the UC campuses from falling victim during the 
state's rolling blackouts -- although UC Santa Cruz went dark one day in 
January because its co-generation plant was out. 
MARKET PRICES AHEAD
Still, UC officials are asking the Legislature for extra money, warning that 
a systemwide natural gas bill is expected to rocket from $26 million last 
year to a projected $64 million this year. A contract for low-priced gas is 
expiring and UC will soon find itself paying market prices. 
That means UC will face having to raise dormitory fees, cut back on night and 
weekend classes and turn down the air conditioners in the summer, leaving 
classrooms sweltering. 
Saying that that would be unacceptable, Assemblywoman Elaine Alquist, D- 
Santa Clara, chair of the Assembly Higher Education Committee, called a 
hearing on the issue last month. 
""I really wanted to hear how they were going to cope with the crisis,"" she 
said. 
UC is already negotiating with the State Department of Finance to get about 
$217 million for an additional list of energy efficiency and conservation 
projects that could save 149 megawatts within three years. Reducing 
electricity means reducing reliance on natural gas. 
John Baca, manager of the policy and strategic planning program for the 
Office of Energy Assessments at the state Department of General Services, 
said higher education facilities tend to consume a lot of energy. 
""They have experiments that just can't go off and they have a lot of flue 
hoods, and things like that,"" Baca said. ""They have to have power for a lot 
of different things all the time, so there is still a lot of potential at the 
higher education level. But I think UC has done a really fantastic job."" 
SYSTEMWIDE CHANGES
The efforts have been made across the system. 
UC Santa Cruz undertook an extensive conservation project that reduced 
electricity consumption in academic and administrative buildings by 6 
percent. 
UC Davis has spent about $15 million on conservation renovations during the 
past 10 years, saving at least $3 million a year. 
At UC Berkeley, more than $6 million has been spent since 1986 to improve 
energy efficiency on the campus by modifying and reducing light fixtures in 
older buildings, installing centrally located automated controls that can run 
heating and cooling equipment on a flexible schedule, and improving 
efficiency around heating pipes. 
""Our usage is only 3 percent above what it was in 1972-73,"" said Paul Black, 
a senior engineer in the UC Berkeley physical plant department. ""And if you 
think of all the computers added and also the air conditioners we have added 
to cool computer rooms and labs, that is good.""

"Patricia:  I can't thank you enough for arranging the many meetings and 
introductions for the Enron legal group.  Lynn and I are extremely grateful 
as it made our lives much easier and our jobs much more productive.  As 
always, I am impressed with the variety and number of individuals with whom 
you are so well connected.  At the moment, we are trying to finalize an 
internal memorandum addressing the breadth of the tax issues currently 
affecting our business in Argentina.  I would appreciate your comment on the 
following two items:

(1)  Can you cite the law that provides the exemption or modification (not 
sure which it is) that ""financial institutions"" are taxed (Gross Receipts) on 
the spread?  Is it possible to see a copy? (I can probably have it translated)

(2)  I am unclear as to how the Stamp Tax would be calculated with respect to 
Argentine local parties to an ISDA Master Agreement (crossborder trades) or a 
local master swap agreement (local trades).  Execution of the master 
agreement itself does not evidence any transaction.  Even when any 
transaction is executed, you are unable to determine net payments owed by 
either party until termination of the deal.  Brent thinks that the tax will 
be based on the product of the [Fixed Price  X volume X term] even though the 
master agreement will merely provide for netting.  Can you verify?

Give my regards to Pablo.

I look forward to hearing from you.  Regards.  Sara"

Mark, we are working with Ken Raisler to evaluate these products as an 
alternative to the other ""swap"" type product we talked about a few months 
ago.  Let me know if you want to stay in the loop on this at the development 
stage.  I  would suggest that we finalize with Raisler and then bring Carol 
in the loop.

We've all talked about holding a meeting to outline our strategy for the next 
12 months in the Western states (wholesale and retail) and so I propose the 
following.

1. GA Strategy Meeting

We should come together as just GA before meeting with the business people.  
I think that we want to have the following people in attendance (like your 
input) - Paul Kaufman, Joe Hartsoe, Sarah Novosel, Mary Hain, Marcie Milner, 
Steve Walton, Jim Steffes, Harry Kingerski, Sue Mara, Jeff Dasovich, Bruno 
Gaillard, Mona Petrochko, Sandi McCubbin.

The meeting output would be a Strategy and Tactics Plan for June 2000 - June 
2001.

2. GA meeting w/ Business People

A few of us could go to Belden, Calger, Yang, Benevides, Condon to discuss 
the above.  

I would like to have these meetings soon (maybe Thursday, Sept 7 for #1).

Please let me know.

Joe

I have tried to call you several times but no luck.  I want to discuss the
proposed right of way.

With reference to consideration, Howell is not agreeable to 10% down.  We
expect 100%, further I believe we will require a minimum of $2,500
providing we agree on $12.00 per rod.

In the grant delete ""communication line(s)"".  Line 7 insert ""pipeline""
before ""communication equipment"".  Further we need to delete any reference
to surface equipment other than markers, wireleads, vent pipes and
communication equipment.  If a gate plant, ground valve, pigging equipment
or cathodic protection equipment is to be located on Howell's property we
will need other agreements.  The systems Howell operated in Texas,
Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida were contracted in this manner.

Paragraph 3 we need to address our current operations in the area and its
precedence.

Paragraph 4 replace normal plow depth with a ""minimum of four (4) feet""

Paragraph 8 and 12 I think will not be approved by management and it would
make expediting the execution of this document easier.

Paragraph 9, Howell in no way will grant any Power of Attorney for
anything.  Any amendment will be executed by Howell.  Delete all references
to POA in entire agreement and Exhibits.  Further we prefer the entire
right of way be recorded not a memorandum.

Paragraph 16 after ""Right-of-way Grant"" insert except for the term
""pipeline"".

Paragraph 17 delete any reference to Tenant in the entire agreement.  We
will secure execution by the Bank, you may deal with the tenants.

Further, I believe we will need an indemnification provision protecting
Howell from any operation performed pursuant to this grant.

Let's talk.  We will make a deal that all parties can live with.  Our
perspective is a little different than the average rancher.

We still need to bill Conoco the TCR II Surcharges on 20,000 MMBtu per day.  Maybe Michelle can get with Conoco and see how they want it billed.  If they want it billed on their new contract, maybe we can do an amendment.  If they want it billed on the old contracts, then you need to contact someone in the contract group to see how we bill it since the contracts are expired (i.e., overriding the CBS system or something).

I just reviewed the handout for your presentation on the Global Settlement.  One of your slides stated that the 
TCR surcharge is applicable for 10 years from the Global settlement, even if the CFS's contract expires.

Conoco Contract Nos. 20747 & 20748 expired at the end of February.  I assume we should bill the TCR
surcharge for these contracts beginning in March, 2002.  Please let me know if this is correct.

Subject: summer internship



Hi Vince,

I am writing you at this time to inquire as to the potential of renewing my
internship at Enron for the Summer of 2000.

While the date of my request is later than I would have wished, the reason
is that I had originally planned to go back to Turkey this summer and get
my mandatory military duty done. However, I now realize I can put it off to
a further date. That left me wondering if you believe there is a project
that I can get involved in this summer and be useful. If that were the
case, I would be more than happy to postpone my military duty and spend the
summer with the research group. I discussed this with Dr. Ronn, and he is
very supportive of this idea.

I apologize again for bringing up this issue late, and look forward to
hearing from you.

Best regards,

Mobil says the low point of their takes will be during February will be from 
Feb 1 to 14.  So any day in that time period would be a good time for HPL to 
do the required maintenance at the Texoma-Beaumont system interconnect.

We need to define our game plan: 
- what day to do the work
- how much gas HPL will deliver through our own meter
- how we use Centana to deliver the rest of the HPL volumes
- if we had planned in Feb to baseload some of our MidCon obligation at Mobil 
as we have done in Dec and Jan, then we will need to do something different 
whenever we do the maintenance

James - we are scheduled to meet with Mobil in Beaumont at 10.30am Thursday 
Feb 1, to go over the game plan with them.

Pat - do you want anyone from HMS to attend?

Thanks

Lee

"These are not spot deals.  PanEnergy did not receive gas on the exchange.  
However, they did deliver gas to us at Cotton Valley.  According to the 
contract, when volumes are overdelivered, HPL buys the gas at GD-.10.  So, in 
order to correctly estimate our economics, I changed the price on the 
delivery to reflect how the deal will settle.  This occurred in August and 
September.  Any spot deals will be on seperate tickets.

Days 5 & 6, as well as 9-31 should be settled as if the exchange was in 
place.  (PanEnergy overdelivered about 7,800 per day, which we buy at Gas 
Daily -.10)

Daren:
I am taking over the Duke account from Katherine and am having trouble with 
8/00 production.  It looks like we have some spot deals included in the 
exchange deal 157288.  I think days 9 - 31, which are priced at GD - 0.10, 
need to be moved to a new ticket if they are spot.   Let me know if you 
agree.  Also, can you confirm for me that days 8/5 and 8/6 are suppose to be 
exchange?  The sale volume for those two days was zero, so there was no 
exchange.  We have not received any statements from Duke yet, so there is 
nothing to verify our volumes.

You may also want to look at Sept. 2000 for deal 157288.  It looks like spot 
deals are being included in the exchange deal.  Those will need to be moved 
to a new ticket if they are spot.

Thanks,
Megan

Calif PUC To Pass Power-Bond Measures By Jan -Counsel

Nov. 1, 2001
LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- California utility regulators expect to approve a measure in January that will allow the state to sell $12.5 billion in bonds to repay the state's general fund and banks for power purchases made this year. 


Delays in the bond issue, originally planned for May, may deepen the state's budget deficit in the coming fiscal year and threaten to further tarnish the state's credit ratings. 


""At this point, we are aiming to have everything done by January related to the revenue bond sale,"" said Gary Cohen, general counsel for the California Public Utilities Commission. 


The PUC refused earlier this month to pass a so-called rate agreement, which would spell out how the bonds would be repaid, because it would give the the state's power buying arm carte blanche to raise electricity rates without public hearings and without oversight by the PUC. 


In addition, PUC President Loretta Lynch wants the governor's office to renegotiate the tens of billions of dollars in long-term power contracts it signed with more than a dozen energy companies at the peak of the market. One of the commission's objections to the rate agreement is that it would lock the state into overpriced, overlong deals that will saddle ratepayers with high electricity costs for the next decade. 


So far, neither the state nor the PUC have identified which power pacts they want to renegotiate. Spokesman for Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Williams Cos. (WMB) Calpine Corp. (CPN) and Sempra Energy Resources, a unit of Sempra Energy (SRE), have said they haven't been formally contacted by state officials to talk about renegotiating the deals. 


Williams and Dynegy said they would consider renegotiating the contracts, but only if the result would benefit both parties. Calpine said it would be difficult to rewrite the pacts, but the company is willing to talk with state officials. 


The PUC met with members of Gov. Gray Davis' staff last week to figure out a strategy for renegotiating the contracts, and talks are ongoing, Cohen said. 


""We are all in agreement that we want to renegotiate at least some of the contracts,"" Cohen said. ""We have technical people looking at the contracts to figure out what we want to accomplish, what kind of portfolio we want in terms of duration and price. My view is we need to have a solid plan before we embark on renegotiations."" 


Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for Davis, said the governor's office had no comment on the renegotiation talks. "
"Sorry for the delay - this looks fine to me.

Joe,

Based on our discussions, the facts are as follows: Prior to 12/2/01,
ENA sold gas to One Oak.  During the period 12/4-12/31/01, Duke Field
Services inadvertently flowed gas on the MRT pipeline to ENA. ENA used
the gas received from Duke Field Services to fulfill its obligations
under the sales agreement to One Oak.  

ENA is obligated to pay Duke Field Services for the gas it received and
later delivered to One Oak because this event occurred post-petition and
benefited ENA.

		 Subject: NYMEX F/S

ENA BA&R is currently in the process of preparing the 12/31/99 financial 
statements to be filed with the NYMEX by July 21st in order to keep our 
trading seat.  These financial statements reflect all of the North America 
trading operations.  ECTEG1 is ENA's legal rollup within Hyperion and should 
reflect all of the North American trading (i.e., price risk management) 
activity.  Therefore, Consolidated Reporting, with the assistance of Trading 
Accounting and Tax, prepared the financial statements with ECTEG1 activity.  
These financial statements are complete and ready for BA&R management review 
and reflect $722MM in earnings.

However, as of 6/29, we were notified by the Tax department that three 
companies were included in ECTEG1 as of 12/31/99 that were no longer legal 
owned by ENA.  In addition, there was one company that became ENA owned 
during 1999.  The companies are as follows:

Improperly Included:
ECM Treasury Consolidated  (Company 969)
ECT Retail Services    (Company 1Q6)
ECT Power Marketing, Inc. - Retail  (Company 890)

Improperly Excluded:
Enron Gas Liquids, Inc.    (Company 104)

I have corresponded with Tana Jones from the Legal department, Johnson Leo in 
Corporate Reporting, and Julie Gartner from the Tax department to determine if
the financial statements that we prepared reflected accurate and complete 
North America trading activity.  These discussions confirmed that the 
Hyperion legal 
structure was not accurately reflecting ENA's actual legal ownership.  In 
addition, the three companies have $192MM in trading activity income that 
would be
removed from the bottom line.  This activity should probably be reported to 
the NYMEX (regardless of legal structure) as it represents price risk 
management
activity.

The primary issue is accuracy of the financial statements.  We are prepared 
to have to restate the compiled financials as soon as we are notified where
we can retrieve accurate ledger information.  The other main issue is 
timing.  We need to file these financial statements no later than July 21st.  
Before that can
happen they need to be reviewed by several levels of management in several 
departments.

The Legal department is currently reviewing the NYMEX requirements in order 
to determine the proper activity to report.  As soon as that is determined, 
we can
proceed with data retrieval.

Please contact me if have any questions, concerns or comments.

"As most of you know, in a last ditch attempt, we are trying to develop a 
complete ""solution"" to the California problems that can be presented in the 
Sec of Treasury discussions.  It would be very helpful if people would 
comment or provide analysis on the likelihood of the following settlement 
points:  

1. Long-Term Contracting
key need of CA is NEW POWER PLANTS - KEY MESSAGE - AND IT'S IN CALIFORNIA'S 
AUTHORITY TO DELIVER
Live Auction conducted by DEALBENCH
auction should be focused on ""build"" economics
parties bid ($/Mwh) for the right to deliver 500+ MW (the right size needs to 
be determined) into Cal ISO control area for 5 years and the winning bidder 
obtains a pre-approved generation site in California (with all permits, 
siting obligations, and interconnection - BIG ISSUE) to build starting within 
2 months
focusing on just delivered energy without generation site is difficult to 
price (market too illiquid)
keep the number of auctions to a minimum (probably 6 - 10) for each utility
Counterparty is State of California (some agency)
maybe structure the bids to be 50-50 baseload vs. peaking

2. Utility Retail Ratemaking
per RELIANT ENERGY model, need $85/Mwh on average to work within retail 
framework (how much would rate increase does this create?)
goal must be to have EBITDA positive utilities, although long-term utilities 
should be EBITDA = $0 for generation sales
keep the current PX structure? 
Utilities may have to ""eat"" some of the current undercollection

3. Interim Credit Support
pro rata credit from all creditors (including banks and energy suppliers)
60 day forbearance (to allow the auction to occur)

4. Liability 
PG&E, SDG&E, and SCE agree not to sue any suppliers
State of California considers ""taking"" all civil cases and not pursuing
State of California agrees not to pursue any criminal cases

5. Other Actions
FERC agrees to immediate price cap lifting
FERC and California agree to complete non-stakeholder board for ISO
CPUC immediately finds that the result of the auction is ""reasonable""


The key point is to (1) stop the current bleeding by getting long-term deals 
in place soon and (2) manage the rate shock.  We will be working three things 
(1) structure of the long-term auction, (2) rate model showing how high 
prices of long-term auction power can be, and (3) financial results for 
utilities under this outcome.

What else needs to be included in a settlement?

 Dear Sara,

I am attaching the long form confirm re a deal which we did yesterday  - small, but our office's first yen based crude transaction!  

The yen-USD forex however was done through ENA and needs to be documented.  ENA will also be providing these services to EJ (through our metals desk) moving forward so we need a master agreement in place.  

Alan suggested you may be able to assist with a form of document that would work in this situation.  The only requirement from EJ's perspective is that it be effective from yesterday, Oct 11, 2001.  

If you need more information about the forex arrangements we have with ENA, Sheila / Jan Erland may be able to assist.

Otherwise, if you were able to get a draft together, I will run it by Susan Musch and Jan-Erland, and get it signed up.

Thanks Sara.

Jane McBride

Ps. I didn't make it to the GM Legal Conference this time but hope it went well and to see you in May."

I will take a look at this either tonite or in the morning.  Since the UEI 
Holdings Guaranty which we reference in paragraph 9 of the Amendment covered 
both US and Canada transactions, I don't think that we can say that it has 
been terminated until we sign up the Engage Canada deal.  Can you add 
language to the Coastal Guaranty that takes care of this instead.  I would 
prefer to say in paragraph 9 of the Engage US amendment that ""The Guaranty of 
Party B dated as of May 19, 1997, heretofore delivered by UEI Holdings Inc., 
formerly known as Union Energy Inc. in favor of Party A as beneficiary, is 
hereby replaced by an executed Guaranty from Coastal Corporation, a copy of 
which is attached hereto as Exhibit B but only with respect to the 
obligations of party B under the Master Agreement that are guaranteed 
thereunder.""  Let me know what you think.

Kathy-----Here is what I know about Cornhusker:

Our supply comes from Apache & Williams

Our market typicially is the plant (Tenaska IV Partners)
If the plant is down, Brazos Utility has the right to the gas if they want it
If Brazos does not call for the gas, then we will sell off to whomever we can

We just get a flat fee on this gas per MMBtu, whether it goes to the plant or 
not

Daren Farmer knows the specifics about the deal

Hope this helps, call with any questions.

"As we begin to meet with FERC Staff on the Wholesale market issues related to 
CA problems, I think that we need to put together a list of questions that 
FERC needs to be asking Western power market participants.  

The following are some questions that I think are important to have FERC ask; 
I'm sure there are more.

1. Were California utilities underscheduling load into the PX day ahead 
market?  
2. How many MWs did the CA ISO procure during each hour during the Summer 
2000?  How does this compare with CA ISO procurement during 1999?
3. Has PG&E changed its bidding behavior associated with its Hydro facilities 
in 2000?  
3. Are there baseload facilities that were operated differently in 2000 than 
in 1999?
4. Were any generation plants off-line due to unplanned maintenance during 
Summer 2000?
5. How did the CA ISO demand side program work?  Why didn't more load 
participate?  
6. What options did SDG&E have to ""hedge"" its retail rates?  What were prices 
in the CAL PX block forward market on Jan 15, 2000 and May 15, 2000?
7. How high did natural gas prices go in California for generation during 
Summer 2000?
8. Were other Western power markets prices higher (year-on-year)?
9. Did the CA ISO Board face political pressure to reduce bid caps?  Is this 
appropriate for a FERC jurisdictional entity?
10. What specific details is SDG&E referring to in its Complaint on 
""unworkably competitive"" CA ISO markets?  Can these be fixed ""quickly""?

Please add other questions.

Subject:	Change of Control Provisions


As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

In retrospect, I apologize for not contacting Ms. Mann earlier (my former

confront the issue that we are confronting.  Based on the attachment below 
and the other emails I am forwarding you, it appears that our procedure for 
accelerating EECC's payment rights will be to issue a letter to Republic Bank 
who will then issue a default letter to Tribasa and then based on that we can 
then issue a demand to AI.  If Ms. Mann so desires, she is welcome to 
participate in our 2:45 conference call, by rsvping through email.

"London traders are transacting from London in the names of both ECT(Houston) 
and ECTRIC(London) with DAPSA and Sempra.  The deal tickets are still being 
sent to Houston for confirmation preparation (rather than from London where 
the trade is actually consummated).  With respect to Sempra, we were 
previously advised that Sempra would not transact directly with ECTRIC absent 
a Master but this cannot be accurate because some Sempra deal tickets recite 
ECTRIC's name.    

This message is FYI if there are no regulatory issues involved.

Houston will certainly document back-to-back internal transactions.

Attached please find the latest credit worksheets for the physical and

The credit worksheet for the physical transaction is in the form of a 
specific confirmation that will be confirmed under the existing Master Energy 
Purchase and Sale Agreement between EPMI and Merrill Lynch Capital Services.  
The credit worksheet for the financial transaction is in the form of a new 
ISDA Master Swap Agreement.  Per Bill Bradford, please note that Credit 
approval for both worksheets are contingent upon legal approval by Mark 
Haedicke of the physical and financial setoff/netting assumption.

I have requested and am waiting approval from Jeff McMahon to accept the 
counterparty's request to set the third party cross-default amount of 
$50,000,000.  For the purposes of these credit worksheets, the amount 
proposed remains at $100,000,000 for both parties.

Please call should you have any questions, x3-0554.

Subject: Henwood Report


Tanya has been very helpful recently in helping us to understand the Enron 
VAR modeling system.  So when I received this Henwood report yesterday, I 
immediately thought that this was an opportunity to reciprocate.  (I have 
been hoping to develop some software tools that I think you could use, but 
... you know the drill.)  Although there should be no problem from Henwood's 
standpoint with sharing this document with you, I would prefer that you not 
pass it around outside of Research.

The PGE Generation & Engineering Services department paid for our one-year 
subscription to Henwood's off-the-shelf market forecast.  They wanted a 
broader perspective of the market, given their interest in building power 
plants.  I was not surprised to see, however, that Henwood's 20-year price 
forecast almost lies directly on top of the one that I prepare for PGE.  
Henwood is slightly more bullish on gas prices and seems to be assuming 
greater efficiencies of new generation.  The implied market heatrate, 
however, effectively nets out much of the gas price assumption, and it 
matches our own projections very well.

Be sure to save this and open it outside Lotus Notes or whatever mail system 
you have now.  It is rather large and could lock up your mail.

Are you aware of any subscriptions or contracts that Enron has with Henwood?  
Does London still use their model?  I will be attending a Henwood 
presentation on this report tomorrow in Seattle.  Are you interested in what 
I bring back?

Best Regards,

"Karen:
See highlited section of story below.  PG&E's got it right.  Recall that DWR 
was only buying power that it determined was ""priced reasonably.""  
Consequently, the net short wasn't getting picked up.  That meant that the 
ISO would have to go to the real-time market to close the gap.  The ISO would 
then charge the utilities for the power purchased.  Recall that Bob Glynn 
referenced the $300 MM/month that continued to pile up on PG&E's balance 
sheet as one of the several reasons that PG&E put itself into bankruptcy.  
Now that PG&E's in bankruptcy, the state is now responsible for the full net 
short, and can't continue to sluff it off onto PG&E's balance sheet.  So it's 
therefore no surprise that the State's daily bill for power purchases has 
increased dramatically---just not for any of the bogus reasons cited by 
Governor Backbone.

Best,
Jeff

		 Subject: CA legislature in doubt

FYI.  Ray

NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
published : April 20, 2001
CA Governor, Regulators Push on, but Legislature Raises Doubts 
Two certainties prevailed in California's blighted energy landscape Thursday: 
wholesale power bills are getting bigger and state regulators are trying 
harder to salvage Gov. Gray Davis' deal with Southern California Edison Co. 
But in the state legislature from which the ultimate solutions must come 
there was growing skepticism, despite a series of meetings with the governor 
earlier in the week. 
While nervousness over the state's electricity bill and the prospect of 
insufficient power supplies this summer prevailed, Davis met with 25 members 
of California's congressional delegation at a Los Angeles airport hotel to 
press his case for federal actions to resolve the seemingly endless energy 
dilemma. 
The California Public Utilities Commission has ordered a statewide 
investigation of the contractual obligations of the almost 700 small 
(qualifying facility) QF generators toward the utilities, but most of the 
five-member commission's activity was focused outside its regular business 
meeting in San Francisco. CPUC President Loretta Lynch offered empathy toward 
Edison's financial plight and renewed pleas for federal regulators to provide 
wholesale price relief. 
""I have committed that the CPUC will expeditiously review those provisions of 
(Edison's proposed agreement) that require CPUC resolution, and I have taken 
steps to begin that process,"" Lynch said in a prepared statement released 
Wednesday. ""In the meantime, I commit to reviewing on a priority basis any 
and all proposals that promote the financial health of California utilities 
and the interests of its consumers."" 
Davis and some of the CPUC commissioners have been complaining that the cost 
of the state's daily purchases of wholesale power on the spot market have 
increased from about $50 million to more than $70 million daily since the 
April 6 bankruptcy filing of Pacific Gas and Electric Co., but the utility 
challenged the conclusion that the court filing caused the latest price 
increases. 
""While it is understandable, even laudable, that the governor would want to 
fully explain the downsides of utility bankruptcy, this claim is simply not 
accurate,"" said PG&E utility spokesperson John Nelson. He argued that the 
increase in state payments for power reflect that the state water resources 
department (DWR) now is covering all spot purchases, including the often 
costly real-time emergency purchases by the state's transmission grid 
operator, Cal-ISO. 
Thus, PG&E's spokesperson said the more likely cause of the increased power 
bill lies with recent moves by federal regulators and Cal-ISO, noting that 
the state grid operator should only sell to ""creditworthy"" entities. These 
moves were done independent of the PG&E bankruptcy filing, Nelson said. 
As the daily bill for power goes up, draining the state treasury more 
quickly, pressure mounts for a resolution to the utility financial situation. 
But the legislature has expressed skepticism toward the governor's proposed

In adopting the new investigations of QF generators, the CPUC's commissioners 
acknowledged that eventually the issue of back payments to the small 
generators needs to be addressed, particularly to a group representing up to 
3,000 MW collectively.

"I think you, or someone in your group, should cover this.  The attendees are 
operations focussed and may be interested in issues such as siting, 
interconnection and environmental issues.  Also, from a more macro 
perspective, what kinds of demands the new industry structure may place on 
operators  -- the importance of flexibility in asset operations (ie the 
premium the market will place on quick response) or the challenges of 
different scheduling regimes between the gas and power markets.

Steve,
As we discussed the other day, Enron's Global Asset Management Conference 
committee would like to invite you to be the sponsor for our panel discussion 
on Enron's Regulatory and Governmental Affairs issues for this conference 
which is being held at the Woodlands Conference Center on October 8-11.  We 
would like to have your panel discussion on October 9, from 3:30-5:30PM.  We 
would like to ask that the you to put together a session that highlights 
topics that provide a insight from both a national and international 
perspective  

The conference committee has chosen the One Enron theme since the attendees 
at the conference are coming from all the Enron business units both 
domestically and internationally. The estimated attendance at the conference 
will be 225 Enron and Joint Venture employees.  The invitations are being 
issued enterprise-wide to employees who are engaged in 
operations/maintenance/purchasing./sourcing  This conference is the expansion 
of the annual plant managers' conference that is held each year in Houston.  
We are replacing it with what we will be a ""Best in Class"" conference 
addressing multiple topics that will provide direction that will result in 
lower costs, increased earnings and employee retention.  We will also be 
utilizing this conference as an additional mentoring activity for our 
Minority/Women Business Enterprise suppliers.
I hope that you will accept our invitation, because I know many of the 
participates will benefit from your panels experiences and knowledge.

An agenda has been attached for your review, however it is still in 
development.


If you have any questions, I can be reached at (713) 646-8235.

Elizabeth White/HOU/ECT@ECT, Ben Jacoby/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: POMPANO BEACH 
PROJECT


Dave, since you and I discussed the Pompano Beach Project last week and the 
history of the ""rejected $10,000 Contribution to a city literacy group"" and 
the unfavourable Enron publicity which resulted, I thought you might be 
interested in  the memo from Eric below and a brief ""heads-up"" on the current 
state of affairs on this project.  The requirement that the Developer  
provide a Fire Truck and  certain of the other costs we discussed in our 
meeting have in the current draft been depicted as ""fire protection services"" 
and other ""services in connection with the development of the project "" to 
satisfy accounting concerns as well as to be less inflammatory . 
Nevertheless, as you can see from the forwarded memo, there is a ""leak"" to 
the press and I predict more negative publicity to come as the result of the 
requests of the city, theNot in My Backyard feelings of the community, the 
previous negative publicity, and the backlash of the controversy resulting 
from Bush's election and accompanying local perception of Bush and Enron 
being one and the same evil.

As you know Ben is in Florida today meeting with city officials and 
discussing  the new proposed development agreement. Ann Elizabeth can provide 
a copy of the latest draft proposal which has been blessed by accounting and 
the Turbo-park gurus. Nothing will be signed without a legal opinion of local 
counsel as to the legality of the proposed agreement when viewed in light of 
the previous discussions with the city, including the terms contained in the 
previous drafts  discussed between Steve Krimsky and city officials.


Sincerely

Barbara

Subject: Developer's Agreement and Payment in Lieu of Taxes

I spoke to Tia O'Neill of the Pompano Pelican.  She received the same 
information (as the Sun Sentinel received) from some nameless person 
regarding the payment in lieu of taxes issue and some sort of statement that 
this was a roundabout way for Enron to bribe our way to victory.  I explained 
to her as I had the Sun Sentinel all of the issues surrounding this topic.  
However, she went further with questions regarding possible amounts of $1 
million (for property taxes) or even $2 million to cover ""some sort of sales 
tax.""

It is quite evident someone close to the discussions is feeding the media.  
Any thoughts?

I am unable to gather any more information from David Fleshler (Sun 
Sentinel).  Interestingly though, the Sun Sentinel has not run the article on 
this issue.  My guess is they have realized that there is no story here.

Ulrich/HOU/EES@EES 
Subject: Dow Jones Index information

Additions from Jubran...

Proposed pricing mechanism:

Dow Jones Electricity Indexes, specifically their NP15/SP15 indexes.
- the indexes are based on weighted average prices and total volumes
- they measure ""bilateral one-day prescheduled, financially firm transactions""
=> therefore the Dow Jones Index more accurately reflects market pricing
- Dow Jones has the right to randomly audit the data providers

why not the ex-post ISO?
- generators are not selling to California's ISO because of the $150/MWh 
price cap,
=> therefore prices coming out of the ISO do not reflect real market prices
- there are purchases above the $150 soft cap, but the pricing of the out of 
market transactions is explained to FERC only, this information is not in the 
public domain
- if generators are not selling into the market, there is no liquidity, 
therefore prices are not reflective of the prices that buyers must pay
- and generators may not be selling into the market due to the credit exposure

why not use the ex-post ISO price on an interim basis?
- because putting a false cap on the market price will result in price 
increases to DA customers, contrary to AB1890, without due process
- Decision 99-06-058 set the foundation for the PX credit to reflect real 
market prices, PG&E's proposal does not adhere to this.

"
"Mark,  The following are my responses to Phillip's changes in our letter 
agreement:

1.  1st Sentence of Second Paragraph - Strike of reference to Section 3.3 and 
reference to Appendix 1 - ENA's right to decrease confirmed volumes and 
Phillips' rights to release the gas are clearly set out in Section 3.3.  The 
""Operations/Delivery Scheduling Procedures"" only are the method by which this 
is effected.  This change needs to be removed.

2.  1st Sentence of Second Paragraph  - The remainder of the changes to the 
1st Sentence except for the strike of Seller's Daily Deliverability are OK.  
Seller's Daily Deliverability needs to remain as this is the correct 
terminology under the Purchase Agreement.  All we are doing here is effecting 
the provisions of the Purchase Agreement to which both parties have already 
agreed.

3.  The added sentence at the end of the second paragraph - This needs to be 
stricken.  The Medicine Bow System is not ENA's and we do not want to create 
a firm purchase deal with this letter. 

4.  1st Sentence of Third Paragraph - The add from ""that quantity of Gas..... 
to.......... (the ""Released Gas"""" should be removed.  The term Released Gas 
is defined under the Purchase Agreement and doesn't need to be defined in 
this letter.   I am OK with ENA ""hereby"" agreeing to waive any and all rights 
it has to under Section 3.3 to recall the Gas.  However,  the term rights ENA 
""may"" have needs to be stricken.  ENA's position is that we have the right to 
recall the gas as long as it hasn't been released longer than 120 days.     

If you wish to discuss these comments or would like me to discuss these with 
Phillips, I would be happy to do so.

be fairly straightforward.  He said that he needs to get his internal ducks

Thanks Jeff.  On a related note, we are trying to put together a financial

Would you know how to get something like that?

FYI:  Just got off the phone with Michael Hoffman, who's one of two key 
outside financial advisors to Davis on the electricity crisis. The 
administration is trying to get a legally binding agreement between the PUC 
and DWR to ensure that the PUC doesn't muck around with the money (via 
utility rates) DWR requires to be creditworthy.  They were shooting for this 
Friday to have a draft of the document read for folks to review, but it now 
looks like it won't get resolved until (at the earliest) next week----seems 
that the one PUC lawyer who can actually do the work is on vacation.  Go

		 Subject: XOM

Alas, no agreement to execute at this point.  We have come a long way, 
however, and only 2 serious issues remain open.  (All the others are at least 
mostly resolved -- see my 5/1/01 revision w/ marginal notes made during my 
5/2/01 meeting w/ them.)  This file is in my office with all the others.

XOM requires that all of its contracts contain 2 provisions, both of which 
are problematic for Enron.

(1)  The Federal Contractor Supplement -- exhibit F to the EEI Master -- is 
designed to assure XOM's compliance w/ the U.S. federal government's 
requirements imposed on all government contractors.  There are 2 categories 
of requirements:  environmental laws compliance and small business 
participation in federal govt purchases of goods and services.  Since XOM has 
adoped a ""General Commercial Plan"" to comply with such requirements, XOM has 
promised the U.S. govt that ALL its contracts will contain these provisions.  
And that's what the auditors from the U.S. government would be looking to 
ascertain in a review of XOM's compliance.  As for Enron, we do engage in 
business w/ the U.S. govt, but we have not adopted a ""General Commercial 
Plan,"" so we have to address these issues on an ad hoc basis.  Taking the 
last paragraph of this Supplement as an example (addressing the use of women 
and minority owned businesses by Enron in supplying services to XOM under 
this contract), at this point, Enron isn't really prepared to undertake such 
things and all those I dealt with on this seem a bit nervous about Enron's 
ability to comply.  I've communicated w/ Michelle Cash, George Wasaff, and 
Cathy Riley (at Calvin Eakins direction) on this topic, and I asked Cathy 
Riley to have her director, Calvin Eakins, phone me to discuss this further, 
but he did not call.  And there does not seem to be a very good solution to 
this.  XOM has suggested revising the language in Sec. 10.13 (based on my 
5/1/01 draft) to add a final sentence ""The Federal Contract Supplement is 
attached as Exhibit F and each Party shall comply with such requirements to 
the extent appplicable.""  This certainly takes care of all of XOM's concerns, 
but I'm not sure this gets Enron all the way where we need to be.  See, for 
example, Dave Nutt's markup of the environmental provisions (in the file), 
and Cathy Riley says there are no exceptions or exemptions to the small 
business requirements.  We might be able to get some outside expertise on 
this or get Sharon Butcher to help resolve it.

(2)  Limitation of Damages -- Article 7 waives consequentials, etc. for both 
parties.  XOM insists that this provision must carve out damages resulting 
from the ""gross negligence and/or willful misconduct attributable to its 
managerial and senior supervisory personnel"".  You can see the full details 
of the provisions they're looking for in the XOM language in sec 10.4 (same 
draft), the extensive indemnity language which they added in the last round 
and which we generally don't mind giving them.  But this impacts Article 7 
because the Enron version of the waiver expressly states that the waiver 
applies to indemnities, and, of course, XOM will not tolerate any exceptions 
to the liability of each party (yes, it's mutual) for the gross negligence of 
its managers, etc.  There's a true story behind all this that dates back to 
the EPA emissions requirements on Reformulated Gasoline (RFG).  Mobil hired a 
lab to do the testing, the managers of the lab company encouraged the testing 
staff to ""fudge"" the results, tons of RFG hit the market that was not in 
compliance, and a huge black mark on Mobil and zillions of dollars lost were 
the result.  And the contract provided that the lab's damages were limited to 
the testing fees, and apparently, that worked for the lab company.  So, it's 
a deal breaker for XOM  b/c they say that if Enron's managers decide to turn 
off the lights at all the refineries for some specious reason, they need to 
have proper recourse against Enron.   I''ve argued with them about this, 
based on the nature of this contract, the power trading business, etc. but to 
no avail .....  It would seem that Enron's language in Art. 7, w/ the 
following rather narrow change, might work for both parties, but it's up to 
you, now.
 UNLESS EXPRESSLY HEREIN PROVIDED, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE FOR 
CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, LOST 
PROFITS OR OTHER BUSINESS INTERRUPTION DAMAGES, BY STATUTE, IN TORT OR 
CONTRACT, UNDER ANY INDEMNITY PROVISION OR OTHERWISE provided, however, that 
nothing in this Article 7 shall be interpreted to limit either Party's 
liability under Article 10.4(b).  
Let me know if you have any questions about this.

"Initial thoughts - 

Can we use Enron Australia as the counterparty to avoid these issues for now, 
and then when a book has been established assign all the positions to Enron 
Japan?

Can we get (or maybe give?) the rep if we soften it a bit by taking out the 
word ""ordinary"" or maybe the entire phrase ""in the ordinary course of its 
business""?

Is there a government agency that can give us an opinion or ""no action"" type 
of letter to give us some comfort that we are OK?  It may not be quick enough 
to get us through this trade but it might open the door for future business.

If the end result is that there is no adequate fix and local counsel advises 
that we are taking significant potential criminal liability, I would think 
that both parties would be willing to agree to unwind the trade.  If 
necessary, my suggestion would be to raise the potential for criminal 
sanctions issue to Mark H.  (What are the potential sanctions?)

Have spoken with Joe Hirl.  If there was any way we can take advantage of or 
use for the purposes of establishing Enron Japan weather exposure, all the 
exposure of other Enron companies, this should help us to establish 
legitimate weather exposure.  Enron always has weather risk and we keep a 
global weather book although of course we have open positions sometimes.

Obviously we are mostly concerned about criminal liability.

It seems to us that if we cant do the first deal, there is no position for 
market makers here, which just doesn't make sense.

Jeremy,

      Pls see for your information my email to Alan, Mark and Alan.

      As discussed, your answers to my questions can be quite brief
and pls cross
      reference previous advice rather than repeating it.

      I think the answer to question 1 - whether we can give the
warranty - has
      got to be no.  So short and sweet on this is fine.

      Re whether we can go ahead without the same (c)(ii) from them
(but with
      (c)(iii)) is a harder question and I understand that all you can
do is
      explain our risk and exposure, in light of the current factual
situation.

      This is a risk appetite question at the end of the day.

      Dear Alan and Mark,

      I am going to need you to help me make a risk decision.  I
welcome input
      from Mark Evans but he may be more comfortable leaving this up
to Alan and
      Mark because Alan and Mark have been involved in this gambling
issue from
      the beginning.

      Jeremy Pitts and I have had a brief conversation re my email to
him below,
      this afternoon, but he will not be able to get written comments
signed off
      by Japanese lawyers to me until Monday.

      The situation relates to the Tokyo's office's first weather
derivatives
      deal, which is with a company called Toa Reinsurance.  In a
nutshell the
      situation is that negotiations have come to a standstill because
neither
      side can move on their positions re the gambling warranties.
The deal of
      course though has already been done over the telephone several
weeks ago.

      In a nutshell then, based on discussions with Jeremy Pitts, but
to be
      clarified by Japanese lawyer on Monday, the situation is:

      1.   In terms of Enron Japan's ability to trade weather
derivatives here,
      we are operating in the grey even if we can get warranty
5(c)(ii) from
      them.

      2.   ToaRe will not give us the important warranty - 5(c)(ii)
below,
      because they say they can't.  They say they are not actually
""entering into
      the deal to hedge weather related risks arising in the ordinary
course of
      their business"" - which is what the subject warranty says.  B&M
have
      advised that the obtaining of this warranty from a counter party
helps keep
      us in the grey and out of the red in terms of what we are doing
and also
      gives us comfort that the counter party can do the deal.

      3.   ToaRe is, in addition, separately asking us to give them
the same
      warranty.

      Jane McBride analysis

      Re 3 - Given that our legal situation is grey at best, I do not
think we
      should be giving the warranty they have requested.  They say
they will not
      give us that warranty.  The issue then is whether we can go
ahead without
      getting the warranty from them, bearing in mind that a binding
telephone
      deal has been done.

      If you agree with me that we can't give the warranty, then we
have to
      decide whether we can go ahead without getting the warranty
referred to in
      (2) above, from them.  I am not sure however that in practice we
even have
      a choice given that the trade has been done.

      If we go ahead without giving and without getting the warranty,
the risk to
      us is that we are more likely to be in breach of the prohibition
on
      gambling in the Criminal Law.  Are we willing to take this risk
and who
      needs to give me this answer?

      (See attached file:
Weather-HDD-Floor-OTC-ToaRejmb2000-10-20!.doc)


      Dear Jeremy,


      I would like to refine the following instructions.  There are
two (only)
      issues on which we need specific written advice and they both
relate to
      Warranty (c)(ii) of the draft which says ""XYZ is entering into a
weather
      derivative transaction to hedge weather related risks arising in
the
      ordinary course of its business"".

      1.   (a)  Can Enron Japan give the warranty at this stage in its
growth?
      Have we already had any written advice from you on whether Enron
Japan can
      warrant along these lines?  If so, when?  If not, the facts seem
to be
      that:

         Enron Japan plans to trade commodities which are energy
related but
         because we are still building up the business we are not
trading these
         products yet.
         As you know, we are getting into the power market.  If we
have done a
         weather derivative, then we can of course offer better prices
on the
         electricity deals we are negotiating.
         Other Enron companies are of course already trading many
weather
         dependant commodities and power.

      It could be argued therefore that unless we can rely on the
weather related
      risks of other Enron companies to justify our weather derivative
      transacting in these early days, that this is a speculative
transaction
      constituting gambling (depending on how the law on this works).
It is
      understandable that ToaRe would want us to warranty in effect
that we are
      not gambling because we are asking them to do so.  I know we
have had sign
      off from B&M re our weather derivative trading but I wonder if
anyone
      considered what the situation would be before we ourselves had
other
      transactions giving us weather related risks.

      (b)  If not, how could it be amended so that we can give it?

      (c)  If still relevant in the context of your answers to (a) and
(b) above,
      they did offer previously to take out all warranties so that
neither party
      gives any warranties.  The deal cannot be cancelled because it
was done on
      the telephone late Sept.  Accordingly, what is the practical
risk of us
      proceeding without the benefit of any warranties from ToaRe
(including the
      warranty that they are under the Insurance Business Law - ie an
insurance
      company.)?

      2.   They are insisting they not give (ii) and that we be
satisfied with
      (iii) only for the purposes of the Gambling Law  Pls confirm in
writing
      whether you think we can still go ahead on this basis.

      Thanks.

"Susan, Attached is the text I am forwarding to the investors.  Please let me 
know if you have any comments.  Thanks for your help.


I talked further with Transwestern Counsel today concerning the issues and 
have the following points;

 1.  FERC was made aware of the Compression Services arrangement with ECS (at 
that time via Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.) in the filings for the 
certification of the Kachina units.  FERC simply didn't ask any further 
questions in that proceeding.  The Operation & Maintenance Agreements in 
place for the Kachina units essentially accomplishes the same things as the 
Operational Control Agreement in Gallup.  TW feels the O&M agreements would 
be adequate to answer any questions that possibly FERC might ask regarding 
this subject matter.  The Operational Control agreement was put into place in 
Gallup because it was thought to be easier to give FERC exactly what is was 
looking for rather than show them the Gallup O&M Agreement which might slow 
down the process at that time.

 2.  There is no basis in FERC Regs or the NGA for FERC to impose any type of 
penalty or discontinue the Compression Service's due to TW's operation of 
Kachina without the Operational Control Agreement.  No regs or law address 
this situation.  Again this is tempered by the fact that FERC was made aware 
of the arrangement and didn't ask any questions and the O&M agreement is in 
place to accomplish control for TW.

 3.  I also faxed you a copy of Section 19(c) of the NGA which indicates that 
the petition for rehearing does effect the status of the certificate.  
Construction is moving ahead and the anticipated start date is May 1.  

I will forward the filing TW made wrt to the Operational Control Agreement as 
soon as I recieve it.  Let me know if you have any further questions (713) 
853-3512. "

NETWORK WORLD FUSION FOCUS: MIKE JUDE and NANCY MEACHIM
on APPLICATION SERVICE PROVIDERS
Today's focus: ASP Noise
03/22/00

Dear Wincenty Kaminski,

Today's focus: ASP Noise
---------------------------------------------
By Mike Jude and Nancy Meachim

One problem with the application service provider market is that no one
has yet been able to quantify it. This problem jumped out at us
recently as we were surfing the ASP News Web site.

ASP News, which is a very good resource for anyone interested in the
ASP world, has developed a dynamic directory of network-based service
providers.  To give you an idea of how much information is included,
the directory lists four main categories and 15 subcategories.
Although these categories are not exclusionary, they clearly represent
a lot of companies.

The question is, What does it all mean? What is the difference between
an independent software vendor (ISV) and an ASP?  How is a prospective
customer supposed to find the right vendor for its needs?

Therein lies the rub, as they say.  ASP News=01, directory makes it appear
that the service provider marketplace can be clearly defined and the
vendors listed in a neatly parsed, easy-to-understand directory.  Of
course, it isn=01,t that simple.  An ASP infrastructure provider, or AIP
(how=01,s that for an acronym within an acronym?), may, by virtue of a
partnering arrangement, also compete against full-fledged ASPs.  And
what about the mutable ISV?  What little push is required for an ISV to
become an ASP?

The fact of the matter is that the ASP News directory made me realize
that we have so much information that we can=01,t see the trees.  We can
only see the forest.

As providers all vie for customer attention and try to satisfy every
user need, their messages are becoming confused.  The service provider
market has reached a point of information overload.  So much marketing
is being pushed out that customers are hearing only noise.  The message
is being lost.  It is as though every person in a community was on a
telephone party line all talking at once.  Star Trek=01,s Borg
notwithstanding, being on the receiving end of such a call would leave
anyone confused about what was being communicated.

Too much information can be worse than no information at all.  At least
we don=01,t have to spend time trying to understand silence.  Today=01,s AS=
P
market makes customers work too hard.

The huge potential of this new market is attracting all types of
vendors.  New players are jumping on the bandwagon every day (even if
only via marketing material).  As a result, customers are confused, and
providers are unable to differentiate themselves or their solutions.
In short, the ASP market is being held back.

So, how do we get past the competitive chaos? We get past it in typical,
free-market style.  Because there are too many providers, many will
simply find themselves unable to compete and others will be gobbled up
by larger players as the market coalesces into several major players
with significant chunks of market share and a few smaller providers
serving niche markets.

In our opinion, this is already starting to happen.  Many of the large
players in traditional markets such as enterprise resource planning and
accounting have already begun to form alliances to gain market leverage.
Next, we will see many of these alliances collapse into large monolithic
players, as the smaller members are simply absorbed.  Remember the
lesson learned from the U.S. local telephone service market: Successful
companies always consume their friends.

Why does this happen?  It happens because consumers demand it.  The ASP
market has been wildly successful in convincing executive decision-
makers that outsourcing is the way to go.  People at this level will
not tolerate bedlam for long.  All it takes is a few large customers
choosing the same ASP and the market will be on its way to downsizing
as the winners and sure bets emerge.

One thing is clear: The answer to ASP success is not to simply try and
shout louder.  It is to reduce the noise level, and make it simpler for
the customer to understand your solution.  Remember the Borg, only when
there is a multitude of voices giving the same message is there a
chance for understanding. Make sure you are sending a clear signal, if
you want to get through the noise.

Mark

There are a lot of art galleries in Sao Paulo, but I am not sure what you 
like.  The place I was telling you about is Galeria Jacques Ardies.  Jacques' 
gallery is one of the two best (I think) specializing in contemporary 
Brazilian ""naif"" artists.  Most of his stuff is really interesting, vibrant, 
""Brazilian"" pieces (many from the Northeast of Brazil where they have the 
greatest African influence and a very rich culture).  Kind of funky and ""out 
there,""  but I really like it.  He also has some terrific textile works by 
Madeleine Colaco, an artist who has become very popular in the United States 
(we have one of her wall hangings in our den).

Jacques' web site is at http://ardies.com/quemingl.htm.  I don't think it is 
very representative of what you will find there, but take a look.

There are plenty of other galleries that you can go to as well. Let's talk 
about what you want to see on the way down, and I will give it some thought.

By the way,  I am scheduled to have lunch with Lance on Thursday, and I have 
a phone call into Alan asking for a time with him as well.  I will keep you 
posted.

Regards,
Randy"

? When the Assembly reconvenes at 4:00 PDT it appears they will likely take 
up the budget only; there is no word at this time that they will take up AB 
82XX, and they do not appear to have the votes needed to pass it even if they 
did take it up.  The fact that Burton has come out against a conference 
committee is an additional disincentive to work on 82XX.  Therefore, at this 
time it appears unlikely that 82XX will be passed before the recess.

? Instead, it appears likely that a working group will be established to work 
on SB 78XX during the recess.  This group will likely include members of 
Keeley's, Hertzberg's and Burton's staffs.  These staff members may be 
allowed to go on vacation for a few weeks before returning to work on the MOU.

? The Assembly must pass the budget before they can recess.  It is unclear at 
this time if it will be possible to do so tonight or if it will take a few 
days; the Senate, by leaving, has put the Assembly in a difficult position in 
that they cannot amend anything.  Also, the four Republicans who voted for 
the budget last week are under significant pressure not to vote for the 
trailer bills, meaning that Speaker Hertzberg has to find other Republicans 
willing to cross party lines -- a difficult and very unpopular thing to do at 
this point.  This is likely why the Assembly is meeting so late in the day -- 
to allow Hertzberg time to work on the 8 or 9 Republicans on his list.

the contracts for these counterparties in connection with the Y2K project.  
The attached spreadsheet lists all of the Mission Critical counterparties.  I

there are 2 sheets in the file.  The first contains approximately 140 Mission 
Critical counterparties.  We also added about 60 more that we are assessing 
and these are listed on the sheet labeled ""Tier 2"".  There is a power list on 
that page as well.  If you have any questions on this information, please

"John,

I have received your message regarding Mike Roberts. I could not
agree more. Mike deserves to be compensated for his exceptional
contribution.

Additional recommendation. I think that all weather forecasting support
should be consolidated under Mike (including the weather guys supporting 
power trading). In my view, it was a mistake to remove Mike from
power support. It would also mean a lot to him personally.

1999.
Although we were awaiting new Central Bank regulations, I am beginning to 
think
that the Central Bank revisions will not impact the matrix except with respect
to transactions which may be entered into by entities that are the subject of
the Central Bank regulations.  Please let me know whether or not you agree or
can offer any suggestions.  Thanks and regards.  Sara

Hi Kay.
I undestand that Tim Proffitt is now working on this on the business side. 
Since I understand that Peoples is a utility, I wanted to understand the 
PUHCA analysis on the Enovate entity. Who handled this -- was it Phil Kinkaid 
at V&E?

Joel,

Mary Lynn Ruffner has been involved, but to my knowledge has not reviewed the 
documents.  Matt Gockerman handles most of the tax stuff for enovate.

As for the structure, the commercial focus is on keeping things as simple as 
possible.  

If Sarah doesn't have a copy of the LLC agreement, I can get you one.

Lou Stoler was involved in the formation of enovate, although I coordinate 
most of their legal issues now.

I've seem a preliminary DASH, but I don't know where it sits now.

Hope this helps.

Kay

Subject: Enovate

i faxed comments on the CA and note to Heather at Bracewell earlier today. 
Would like to see copies of the LLC Agreement and the propsed guaranty. 

Who from tax and accounting is reviewing this deal?

Is there a reason for member guaranties rather than equity funding agreements 
or note purchase agreements or any other structure?


Is a DASH/GASH prepared?

Who in legal handled the formation of the Enovate entity? [just in case I had 
questions about structure, etc.]

On 2/14, the Southern California Generator Coalition filed a petmod asking
that the Commission amend winter balancing rules to allow customers to
bring more gas into the system than the 10% imbalance rules permit and that
customers be allowed to use the previous month's accumulated positive
imbalance in lieu of flowing supplies.

The generator members of WPTF with facilities in southern California may be
interested in knowing that TURN's 3/15 comments recommend instead that the
Commission should rebundle the costs of storage for electric generators in
their transportation rates and requires SoCalGas to store gas on behalf of
those customers.

Let me know if you want to see the TURN comments.

What a kind and thoughtful man you always are, Vince....I have always 
appreciated
that in you!  I just moved to another position this week - with Sheila 
Knudsen in ENA
Compensation, but I will always remember how wonderful you are with the 
Associates
and Analysts in the Program, and will miss having the opportunity to touch 
base with
you occasionally.  Thank you for being the special man you are!

Carol

P.S.  I doubt that you know who I am, but I had worked with the program for 
two years, 
having been hired by Mike Smalling in October 1998.  When I first moved to 
Houston 
(from Ohio) and Enron, I rode the #35 bus for a short while.  You helped me 
find Enron the first
day I rode it,  but I didn't know who you were until I saw you at our Super 
Saturday 
activities.  You will never know how much that assistance meant to me - a 
shy, 
street-dumb girl from Toledo, Ohio, in a city like Houston, who didn't know 
how to 
ride a bus!  All of Enron loves you, and I know why!

Celeste, 

I just received Datren Williams' acceptance with the following note attached:

""My graduation date (Ph.D. Candidate from LSU) is Dec. 2000.  Celeste Roberts
has informed me that I would have the option of starting work Feb. 2001.  I am
under the impression that I will start in Feb. 2001.  My offer letter has a 
start date 
of Aug. 2001.  If this is a problem, please give me a call.  
Looking forward to working at Enron.

Thanks a million,
Datren W.""

Please let me know if he may in fact start in Feb. 2001, and if so, do you 
have
a specific date for him, or may he choose?

Thanks, Celeste,
Carol

		 Subject: Re: California Power Crisis

Hi Laura:  I've attached three things, but first wanted to give you a bit of 
an update on events transpiring in Sacramento and at the Public Utilities 
Commission.  

Move to Prohibit Customer Choice
As you may know, AB1X, the bill that the Legislature recently passed and the 
Governor signed, gives the California Department of Water Resources the 
authority to buy power on behalf of the utilities.  Included in that bill, 
however, is a provision that prohibits ""Direct Access,""  California's term 
for customer choice.  

In sum, the bill, in its current form, prohibits businesses and consumers 
from chosing an alternative energy service provider, like Enron.  Our 
understanding is that the Department of Finance called for the prohibition.  
Their reasoning is that they need a ""captive"" customer base to pay for the 
bonds that the State will issue in order to finance DWR's power purchases.

Customer choice was of course the foundation of California's restructuring 
law, AB 1890, and is arguably the only bright spot in an otherwise fatally 
flawed plan.  For example, the only businesses and consumers that were 
protected in San Diego when rates were deregulated last year were those 
businesses and consumers that had signed fixed price power deals with 
competitive service providers.  Ironically, the recently passed legislation 
takes choices away from consumers and diminishes their ability to manage 
their energy costs.  Before AB 1890, consumers and businesses had one 
choice--the monopoly  utility.  With the passage of AB 1X, they again will 
have one choice. But this time their only choice will be to buy from a 
government agency DWR.

A broad coalition of consumer groups has expressed its opposition to the 
prohibition and Senator Debra Bowen (a key player on the Senate side), and 
Fred Keeley (a key player on the Assembly side), have promised to ""fix"" the 
prohibition in another bill ""SB27X.""  I'll forward in another email the 
language that the coalition has drafted and hopes Bowen and Keeley will carry.

Unfortunately, we are now hearing rumors that the Governor intends to direct 
the California Public Utilities to immediately implement the provisions of 
AB1X prohibiting Direct Access, despite the fact that a large coalition of 
consumers and service providers are actively working with Bown and Keeley to 
amend the prohibition language.

It would be extremely useful if the folks participating in the meeting on 
Thursday with the Governor let him know that taking choices away from 
businesses and customers is the wrong way to go and that he and the 
legislative leaders need to work with the coalition to fix it.  You'll note 
in the language developed by the coalition that the proposal strikes a 
reasonable balance between the Dept of Finance's concerns about recouping 
DWR's costs of buying power, and the need to give consumers and businesses 
maximum flexible in managing their energy costs.

Move to Have the State Take Over the Electric Industry in California

John Burton, the Democratic leader of the Senate, insists that, ""if 
California is going to 'bail out' the utilities, the State needs to get 
something in return.""  Burton wants the state to buy and operate PG&E's and 
Edison's transmission system and create a state power authority that would 
get in the business of (among other things) developing, financing, 
constructing and operating power plants and natural gas pipelines.  Burton 
got both of these bills designed to take over the industry passd out of his 
committee yesterday (SB6X and SB33X).  It is unclear how much support he has 
in the full Senate or in the Assembly, but the possibility of passage is 
certainly greater than zero at this juncture.

Others experts are offering a better alternative.  When the federal 
government helped Chrysler out of its financial difficulties 20 years ago, 
the federal government received stock warrants in return.  Until recently, 
the Governor favored warrants, but more recently he has waivered in his 
statements regarding a state take over.  Burton appears to have negotiating 
leverage with the Governor and appears to be using it.

Again, it would be extremely useful for folks to let the Govenor know in the 
meetings on Thursday that a State take over of the industry is an extreme 
move and bad public policy.  I will forward to you in a separate email 
letters that we sent to Burton expressing our opposition to his bills and the 
reasons for our opposition.  In brief, there is no shortage of private 
capital ready and willing to invest in California's energy infrastructure 
(i.e., power plants, electric transmission lines, gas pipelines).  All 
California needs to do is create the investment climate necessary to attract 
the capital.  In addition, history shows that the State is extremely 
ill-equipped to become California's mega-utility. 

Here are the attachments:

A demand buy-down proposal.  We made this proposal to the Governor (and 
continue to propose it to policymakers in Sacramento, Washington D.C. and 
just about everywhere else).  In short, the notion is that, if the market is 
willing to pay power producers, say, 7 cents/kwh to ""produce"" power, then the 
market ought to be willing to pay businesses and consumers 7 cents/kwh to 
""reduce"" power consumption.  

This approach is critical for two reasons:  first, it provides businesses and 
consumers the financial incentives necessary (and that California currently 
lacks) to conserve energy and use energy more efficiently.  Second, because 
California delayed identifying and implementing a solution to California's 
energy crisis, its options for addressing the severe shortages that are 
likely occur this summer are very limited.  Reducing demand represents one of 
the few options that can help to immediately reduce the gap between supply 
and demand.  Putting financial incentives in place now to reduce demand and 
""free up"" electrons is an investment with significant payback.

A ""manifesto"" recently released by a group of Berkeley and Stanford 
economists and industry experts urging the Govenor to pursue a 
""market-oriented"" solution to California's energy crisis.

An editorial in yesterday's Wall Street Journal by Dan McFadden, a nobel 
prize-winning economist from Berkeley echoing the proposal advanced in the 
""manifesto.""  McFadden was one of the manifesto's signatories.

Finally, we are working on ""model Legislation"" proposing a market-based 
solution that we will share with you soon and that we hope the business 
community--and the Valley in particular--can embrace and advocate.

I realize that this is a lot of information and I apologize for the length of 
this note, but I wanted to try to make sure that you're up-to-date.  Please 
don't hesitate to give me a call if you'd like to discuss further.

Best,
Jeff

Please let me know if you are interested  in joining the PoweRisk 2001
speaker panel, and which topic you would like to  cover. I think that
something along the lines of last year's talk (State-of-the-Art Volatility
And Correlation Estimation  Techniques For Multiple Energy Portfolios)
would be brilliant again, but please  feel free to chose something else
that has not been covered  yet.

I look forward to hearing  from you,

Kind Regards,

"I just talked to Kip Lipper--works for Byron Sher, but Burton relies on him alot.  He's drafting the letter that Burton will send to Loretta re: what to do about DA.

I've given Kip the quotes from Angelides re: State's fiscal position will remain STRONG through JULY 2001 irrespective of whether the bonds are issued.  Kip was not aware of the quotes and was anxious to get them.
I reminded Kip that the only reason anyone's given to suspend DA is the urgent need to issue the bonds, but now, even the Treasurer has admitted that there is no urgency to issue the bonds.
I told Kip that the letter to Loretta should say 1) there is no longer any need to suspend DA whatsoever, 2) the PUC should commence ratemaking proceedings immediately to ensure that there is no cost-shifting to small rez and biz customers as a result of DA and 3) the PUC should deliver to the Legislature a study recommending any enhancements, modifications, etc. that should be made to the program to ensure that DA is maintained while ensuring that granny is not harmed.

He said he would see what he could do and said that he would likely get back to us.

There is a concerted effort underway to get the PUC to reject outright at tomorrow's meeting the rate agreement between DWR and the PUC, and DWR's proposed rev. req.  The reason:  no urgency anymore.  Let's take a little time and get it right.

Best,
Jeff"

1) I can put the dollar amount in on day 1 as a demand or facility fee.

2) I need you to give me volume(s) and a price to input into the deal.  I

Dear Mr. Hermans:
The following are the questions I referred to in the the phone message of 
August 6.

1.  In what significant ways does Enron Online differ from the London Metal 
Exchange or the New York Mercantile Exchange in the trading of futures 
contracts (apart from the specific metals it trades) or from other on-line 
exchanges in the trading of physical metal?

2.  What are the most important benefits that a public exchange like Enron's 
brings to the steel industry?

3.  Does Enron have a trade clearing mechanism to guarantee the 
creditworthiness of suppliers and customers?

4.  Why have some on-line steel trading sites failed?

5.  Are there particular problems in trading steel on-line versus oil, 
agricultural products, or any of the other products that are successfully 
traded on-line?

Any information you are able to supply would be greatly appreciated.

Subject:	LJM/Raptor valuations

Ryan,

In the follow up to the meeting we had on Wednesday I would like
to reinforce one point I made. I feel strongly that I cannot support
the valuations my group has produced so far for the LJM/Raptor
related transactions without examination of all the related legal documents.

I feel that we did solid work based on verbal information,  but I cannot
guarantee the quality of the final product without looking at the contracts.
These transactions are too complex and controversial to bypass due diligence requirements 
that you would expect from any professional.

Vince Kaminski"
"Nothing fatal. Here are some thoughts/comments on the AMA for your general 
consideration:

2.2 (d) Bank accounts/bookkeeping.  I've previously been advised that Corp 
performs this function.    Issues which arise: will the money be invested 
overnight, who has signature authority, etc.  We have a draft services 
agreement prepared for Peoples which can serve as a ""go by"" if you decide you 
need a separate doc.

2.2 (b)Billing/collection.  Responsibility generally should stop at sending 
nastygrams.  No duty to hire lawyers, etc.

2.2 (f) Insurance.  In Texas, you have to have licenses to buy/sell insurance 
and adjust claims.  Current language may be soft enough to not violate 
licensing laws.

2.2 (g) cost of filing for licenses and permits not included in defn of 
Marketing Expenses, but there's some catch all language that might help.

2.3  Accountants may like it to be clear that we can't hire/fire O & M 
contractor, set O & M policies, or dispatch plant.

3.2   If there are multiple transactions in a short period, these may be 
captured in one document, not one document for each transaction.

 It would be helpful if the EEIM for use with others explains our agency 
role. (may be in there - didn't review a copy) Is the Owner a power marketer 
yet?  Are we helping them get EEIM's with the Approved Counterparties, or are 
they on their own?

 Will Enron sign on behalf of Owner for Contractor (Enron) transactions 
(sounds silly)?  Is there an EEIM in the works between EPMI and Owner?  

3.3 (f) I suspect by now you've figured out profits, etc, relating to ""day 
of"" transactions.  

3.4  last line - should it be interruptible instead of contingent?  Assume 
Owner has transmission risk?

Is there a ""no third party beneficiary"" clause?  I might have missed it.  Not 
life or death.

Interesting structure.  Could I get a copy of the final document?

Thanks,

Kay

Sandi, 

Sorry for just now getting back with you.  I was out last week.  

The rate ($.04/mmbtu) will be charged on the greater of the volumes nominated 
on the supply contracts or the actual deliveries to the plant.  The fee will 
be adjusted yearly based on CPI.

Bob - I could not remember if we stated the type of settlement on the 
delivered volumes (actuals or nominations).  I think we should use actuals 
due to possibility that the plant could over pull with out our knowledge on a 
daily basis.  We would receive the estimates/actuals on a lag and may have to 
purchase gas to offset the imbalance, even though the plant kept the noms at 
the 45,000 base.  I also think that if the plant does increase the nom, they 
are more likely to pull the additional volume rather than pulling less.  Do 
you agree with this?

Daren,
When we met regarding the rate for the Tenaska Gas Management Agreement, you 
guys mentioned that it would be tied to an index--could you restate for me 
how that is to work--it will start out 4 cents per MMBTU based on the greater 
of the volumes nominated through the supply contracts or the actual 
deliveries to the plant. Then the fee will vary month to month? year to year? 
based on what index?

Thanks,
Sandi

significant contact with Enron, and Mike Swartz advised us before the 
deposition that he did not intend to ask any ""Enron questions.""

Next week Aaron Izowar of White & Case is being deposed.? We think we should 
attend that deposition, and Roland is planning on doing so, unless you

 He is interested mainly in structuring which this role is not. But he
 recognised where it might lead and this would potetially be interesting to
 him but needs to speak to someone who is involved in the strategic direction
 of enrons credit.com.

 Vuthy is aware that Enron have intimated they want to see him again. Howard

NOTICE OF REVOCATION OF INDEPENDENCE

To the citizens of the United States of America,

In the light of your failure to elect a President of the USA and thus to 
govern yourselves, we hereby give notice of the revocation of your 
independence,effective today.

Her Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth II will resume monarchial duties over 
all states, commonwealths and other territories.  Except Utah, which she does 
not fancy.  Your new prime minister (The rt. hon. Tony Blair, MP for the 
97.85% of you who have until now been unaware that there is a world outside 
your borders) will appoint a minister for America without the need for 
further elections.Congress and the Senate will be disbanded.  A questionnaire 
will be circulated next year to determine whether any of you noticed.

To aid in the transition to a British Crown Dependency, the following rules 
are introduced with immediate effect:

1. You should look up ""revocation"" in the Oxford English Dictionary. Then 
look up ""aluminium"".  Check the pronunciation guide.  You will be amazed at 
just how wrongly you have been pronouncing it. Generally, you should raise 
your vocabulary to acceptable levels. Look up ""vocabulary"".  Using the same 
twenty seven words interspersed with filler noises such as ""like"" and ""you 
know"" is an unacceptable and inefficient form of communication.  Look up
""interspersed"".

2. There is no such thing as ""US English"".  We will let Microsoft know on 
your behalf.

3. You should learn to distinguish the English and Australian accents.  It 
really isn't that hard.

4. Hollywood will be required occasionally to cast English actors as the good 
guys.

5. You should relearn your original national anthem, ""God Save The Queen"",but 
only after fully carrying out task 1.  We would not want you to get confused 
and give up half way through.

6. You should stop playing American ""football"".  There is only one kind of 
football.  What you refer to as American ""football"" is not a very good game. 
The 2.15% of you who are aware that there is a world outside your borders may 
have noticed that no one else plays ""American"" football.  You will no longer 
be allowed to play it, and should
instead play proper football. Initially, it would be best if you played with 
the girls.  It is a difficult game.  Those of you brave enough will, in time, 
be allowed to play rugby (which is similar to American ""football"", but does 
not involve stopping for a rest every twenty seconds or wearing full kevlar 
body armour like nancies).We are hoping to get together at least a US rugby 
sevens side by 2005.

7. You should declare war on Quebec and France, using nuclear weapons if they 
give you any merde.  The 98.85% of you who were not aware that there is a 
world outside your borders should count yourselves lucky.  The Russians have 
never been the bad guys.""Merde"" is French for ""sh*t"".

8. July 4th is no longer a public holiday.  November 8th will be a new 
national holiday, but only in England.  It will be called ""Indecisive Day"".

9. All American cars are hereby banned.  They are crap and it is for your own 
good.  When we show you German cars,  you will understand what we mean.

10. Please tell us who killed JFK.  It's been driving us crazy.

Thank you for your cooperation.

"In discussing the Omnibus with outside counsel on a deal, I am not clear that 
the definition of ""Loss"" picks up the concept of ""Unpaid Amounts.""  Arguably 
it does (although the concept of ""Unpaid Amounts"" is built into the ECT 
Master upon which the Omnibus was based for Early Termination for Events of 
Default but not followed through entirely for Accelerated Termination Date).  
My guess is that we decided that Omnibus ""Loss"" pv of economic loss includes 
both past amounts owed/subsequent valuation.  Can you recall?"
"Attached is my list where I approved this initial counterparties.  
Whew...!!!  As you can see, I opened National Gypsum w/o restrictions.  I 
have a database where I keep track of my approvals, unfortunately, the 
computer people are really busy and can't add my drop downs for pulp and 
paper approvals until late this week/early next week.  After reviewing 
thousands of online counterparties, I can't keep track of what I'm telling 
people without my systems in place!

		 Subject: Re: Clickpaper Initial Approvals and Declines

Attached is my list with the approvals from Legal filled in.  As I mentioned 
Friday, we will need to keep track of any trading restrictions on a going 
forward basis, because it might impact approval of new online pulp & paper 
products.  Two of the counterparties on this initial list fall into that 
category.  ConAgra Energy Services, Inc. cannot enter into option 
transactions.  We currently have none online, so it's not an issue, but if we 
add options, this would not be allowed.  Second, The E.W. Scripps Company is 
allowed to trade 48.8 gram newsprint only transactions.  We do not currently 
trade 48.8 gram newsprint.

My database will track this, so to add new products online, the counterparty 
should come back through as an amendment, so I can catch it.  Does this make 
sense to you?

"I am Asst. Gen. Counsel---Litigation Manager at Enron North America. As the 
title implies I am in charge of all litigation in N. America . I also have 
responsibility for litigation in Europe. This job carries great 
responsibilities. Since I arrived in Jan of 1998, the stock has appreciated 
more than 100%. Need I say more. In this job I am also, on occasion,when the 
mood strikes her, allowed to ask irrelevant questions to Carrin Patman about 
how she is conducting our litigation. Suggestions are strictly off limits.   
I have several recollections--- Who can forget Richard Royd's 7am  breakfast 
meetings to answer associate questions. There was a meeting at 7 but there 
was no breakfast served and no questions answered. Sample question: ""Richard, 
why does every firm other than Bracewell have free sodas"" Response: ""I'm glad 
you asked me that question but first let me tell you about the Bejing office"" 
What about the Oscar Madison/ Felix Unger pairing of Bruce Feitchinger and 
Skip McBride.Skip should have known better----when he first interviewed 
Bruce,they  met at Kenneally's Irish Pub.    Personally,since I left the firm 
we have had another son,Matthew,age 11months. Julie has gone back to school

The CFTC issued a Regulatory Framework for some new regulations in late 
February, a copy of which is attached.  No proposed regulations have resulted 
but could come out at any time now.  There is also some activity on the Hill

Agriculture and Senate Agriculture) which are also of interest.  We have been 
monitoring these developments and I'd be happy to talk them over with you.

I heard today that Curtis Smith has resigned.  I am sure that both ot you 
know that Curtis and Jeremy Wong were viewed by users as critical resources 
for ERMS support.  Even at a stand still, my team had great concern over the 
rumored loss of Curtis and/or Jeremy.  And with the assumption that Sitara 
will not go forward for valuation, then ERMS really has become repositioned 
as one of our key, strategic systems.  There is much to do to ""catch up"", if 
you will, with changes and enhancements that were put on hold for several 
years during the Sitara development stage.  And our business continues to 
grow and change rapidly, requiring responsive enhancements on an on-going 
basis.   

I would like to get together to discuss the staffing plan for support of ERMS 
as soon as possible.   We need to understand how day-to-day production 
support will be managed and how development work will be effectively 
handled.  

I will ask my assistant to set up a meeting as soon as possible.

With regards to the Demin water system, there are no capitalized charges in 
these cost figures - everything is expensed.  With respects to the 
Electricity, there is a Demand Charge included in this numer, which makes up 
approximately 50% of the cost.  The rest is attributable to energy costs.

commercial, light manufacturing and industrial end user markets. Enron 
continues to explore opportunities to serve the residential market and we 
believe that the market presents opportunities that were not available even a 
couple of years ago (for example, the  rising acceptance of online purchasing 
by consumers presents low cost customer acquisition and account management 
possibilities that didn't exist when Enron last moved into residential 
markets). We believe, however, that the residential market opportunity is 
best pursued through a separate entity outside of Enron

What about 7:00 at the office or breakfast meeting at 7:00? We can meet
at Hyatt Regency Downtown (Smith Street).

Dear Mr. Kaminski,

 It is a great pleasure and a great honor to schedule you on the MSCF
Speaker Series list for November 3rd, I will make reservation for 8 persons
at a restaurant in Pittsburgh for that evening. Also, if you want I can book
an hotel for you.

Let me know if you have anything in mind  for the topic of the presentation.
There is no real guidelines as we like our speakers to have as much room as
possible. Here is one of the past presentations that had an impact. One of
our speakers divided the presentation in two, the first part was technical,
the second was more general, explaining what his firm was looking for when
hiring new employees.

Thank you very much for accepting our invitation.

Sincerely,




Pierre-Philippe Ste-Marie

Subject: RE: CPCN proceeding - AG intervention

the first step would be to object to the party making the request.  If the
parties cannot work it out as between themselves, the one with the objection
can appeal to the Commission.  I don't believe it would weaken our position
to have released the information to the Public Staff for some of the same
reasons I suggested earlier--particularly the facts that the Public Staff
and the AG have a statutory obligation to represent the public,and are not a
profit-making entity, and neither    would be able to misuse proprietary
information, as NCNG would.

Allyson,

What is the proceedure for objecting to a request (either the intervenor's
or the Public Staff's)?  Is our position weakened in resisting an
intervenor's request if we have given the same information to the Public
Staff?

Thanks again,

Subject:  RE: CPCN proceeding - AG intervention

I thought you might ask me that!  NCNG could make the request, but we would
have a good argument that it doesnt have the same need to know as the
Public
Staff and Attorney General (which both represent ""the Public"") and that the
potential for misuse of proprietary information is much greater and harder
to circumscribe.  I tend to think NCNG would not ask.  Based on the limited
statement of interest in their petition to intervene, it's hard for me to
see what they could justify asking for.  Also, they always have to be
careful, because more often than not, they are going to be on the receiving
end of data requests.  They can't argue that they're entitled to obtain
certain information if they ever want to argue that they don't have to
disclose the same thing.

The NC Attorney General asserts a statutory right to intervene which I
think
misreads the statute but which the Commission has always allowed.  The AG
routinely intervenes.  I suspect that in this case they are interested in
the possibility of bypass and the merchant plant issue.  I will call Len
Green today to find out.  The AG can make the same discovery requests that
the Public Staff makes, subject, as was the case with the Public Staff, to
the execution of a confidentiality agreement.

Hi Allyson,

What is your impression of why the NC attorney general's office has
intervened in the CPCN proceeding?  Is this typical?  Does the AG's office
(or any other intervenor) have any special rights to discover any of the
confidential information we file?

Thanks,

Greetings Justin and Laura:
As we discussed there is a significant coalition of folks working at the 
Legislature to try to remove the prohibition on Direct Access included in 
Hertzberg's AB1X and recently signed by the Governor.

Simply put, it is clear that the prohibition will only be removed if the 
business community communicates clearly  and unequivocally and vociferously 
to the Legislature that Direct Access is a priority for business, and that 
the Legislature must amend AB1X to permit Direct Access.

I've attached the media plan developed by the PR firm that's working with ARM 
(Alliance for Retail Markets) to increase the focus on the need to re-instate 
Direct Access.  The ARM coalition of energy service providers has been the 
focal point of the ever-growing coalition that has developed (and continues 
to develop) around the Direct Access issue.

In order to succeed, it is critical to get as many members of the Silicon 
Valley Manufactures' Group to join in the effort and participate actively, 
particularly in the media effort.  

My colleague Sue Mara has been a key player in the ARM coalition and in the 
development of the medial effort.  She can provide you with any information 
and/or assistance that you need and can also get you in contact with Edelman, 
the PR firm directing the media effort.  Sue's number is 415.782.7802.  Her 
email is smara@enron.com.

And, as always, you can contact me at any time (415.782.7822).

Looking forward to any participation that you folks can offer.

All the best,
Jeff

Hello to the Direct Access Coalition:

Below you will find a summary of the press strategy that Edelman Public
Relations intends to employ over the coming weeks in collaboration with the
Alliance for Retail Energy Markets and the broader Direct Access Coalition.
I will also outline the information that I need from Direct Access Coalition
members who are willing to be involved in media outreach and interviews.
And finally, I have attached supporting documents that you can use as
background material to prep for your responses to any media inquiries that
you may receive.

This Week

1.   We are drafting a ""pitch letter"" to send out by the end of this week
via blast e-mail and fax to the following media lists: 1)capitol press corps
reporters; 2) mainstream media reporters working the energy crisis; and 3)
trade media.  We may also outreach to our editorial board list as well.  Our
pitch will be focused on what it will really mean for small business and C&I
customers to lose the option of retail choice at a time when they are
suffering the financial hardships of skyrocketing energy bills. We will
address the effect on California's future business climate if direct access
is not preserved through legislation that corrects the problems that AB1x
caused for retail choice.  And finally, we will address the point that no
matter what direction California ultimately takes, direct access must be a
part of the solution.  Reporters have seen the recent polls which illustrate
California businesses' concerns with the path the state is on so this is a
prime opportunity to build on those recent media stories.

2.    We recommend a conference call with AReM and the Direct Access
Coalition on Friday to address the questions and suggestions on the press
strategy outlined here.

3.     Determine which people in the Direct Access Coalition are willing to
take media calls on behalf of the coalition.

Next Week

1.   Follow up with key reporters who received the pitch letter.

2.   Evaluate the language of SB 27x and determine whether there will be an
opportunity to hold a news conference with Sen. Bowen in the near future.
Monitor movement at the PUC and determine whether a press conference may be
effective in this arena, or whether we may need to use the option of sending
a media alert before the March 7 hearing, followed by a news release after
the hearing.

3.   Place op-eds (opinion pieces) with key newspapers.

4.   Contact radio news shows and TV public affairs shows (i.e. California
Capitol Week and the California Report) to secure
media interviews.

5.    Revise the SB 27x fact sheet (attached) to reflect the realities of
the amended language in SB 27x.

 What We Need From You

1.  If you are willing to speak with the media, or you have
customers/clients with a positive direct access story to tell, please
respond to this email as soon as you can with your name and contact
information.

2.  If you have draft op-eds written that need to be placed with newspapers
on behalf of your association and the broader coalition, we are willing to
do this for the you.

3.  If you have colleagues and/or staff that are already working with the
media it would be helpful to have this information so that we can
collaborate as necessary.

Subject: Re: Greenpeace letters to Enron Europe concerning our position on 
Kyoto  

All:  I would like to discuss how we might respond to this letter from 
Greenpeace, if at all.  The letter is attached way at the bottom of this 
e-mail, and was received in several Enron European offices as a copy of what 
was sent to Jeff Skilling and other CEOs of major companies.  I have not 
confirmed our receipt of such a letter from any of you, but am assuming it 
was delivered.

I think we could respond in a very positive, constructive manner to 
Greenpeace, based on the statements we've already documented and the 
strategies we are developing.  Lisa Jacobson and I are currently working on 
developing some tighter climate change and clean air ""messages"" that we can 
use in multiple areas ASAP -- upcoming Ken Lay speeches and interactions with 
the Administration, revising the Statement for the 2001 Corporate 
Responsibility Report, Enron Business articles and other internal uses, 
responses to environmental group inquiries and shareholder meeting Q&A, and 
use in everyday speeches and advocacy work.

The Greenpeace questions are tricky, and set up no-win answers for the most 
part.  I doubt they will get any direct answers to questions like:  ""Does 
your company support President Bush in his opposition to the protocol?""   In 
my opinion, we can respond to Greenpeace without directly responding to these 
types of questions.  Addressing Kyoto directly is a slippery slope -- its 
best to stick with the solution-oriented approach we've always taken.

For this reason, I was a bit concerned to see in the e-mail chain below a 
characterization of Mark Palmer's statement on Kyoto (given to Jackie Gentile 
in London) -- ""Enron has always taken the view that the Kyoto protocol was 
not a workable solution to dealing with CO2 emissions.  However it is not the 
principles behind Kyoto that we take issue with, rather it is the vehicle 
that has been devised to deliver the results.""  I believe it is dangerous to 
make such statements for a number of reasons -- Greenpeace would absolutely 
beat us over the head with it, Friends of the Earth could step up its 
shareholder initiatives, etc.    Also, this sets you up for a number of 
follow up questions that I don't think we have answers to, like:  What about 
Kyoto is not workable?  What would make it workable and would we help make it 
workable?  If not Kyoto, what is Enron's preferred ""vehicle?""  I'd really 
rather stay with a constructive, solution-oriented approach and avoid 
reference to Kyoto altogether.

I will talk with Kate Bauer in Enron Europe about this, but I think we need 
to decide on a global, corporate-wide response to Greenpeace.   I would be 
happy to set up a quick conference call on the subject, or just field 
comments by e-mail -- whatever works best.

Thoughts?

this topic in Europe in policymakers' circles. For them neither the
negativity nor the vagueness of the words you quote below (on which Mark

Subject:  Re: Greenpeace letters to Enron in the Netherlands and Spain re
      our position on Kyoto

Lauren

Further to my telephone message today, I would be grateful for your view on
the approach we should be taking to the issue of Greenpeace sending letters
to our European offices re: Kyoto. Several of our offices (Spain, Belgium,
Netherlands) have received a local language version of the letter
originally sent to Jeff Skilling, and other CEOs, on 5 April 2001. The
email chain below gives an indication of what is in circulation.

Greenpeace is expecting a response within the next week. Jackie Gentle has
made me the point of contact in the PR department for this issue. We have
discussed this issue briefly and we would support issuing an initial
statement to acknowledge receipt of the letters, perhaps followed by a
standardised, corporate- approved letter, but would like to ensure our
approach is supported, and consistent with any actions, by Corporate. As
some of the countries in which we operate have tangible ""green"" focused
projects e.g. we have acquired a wind project in The Netherlands, it may be
appropriate to allow such countries to personalise their response in local
language.

If we follow up an initial acknowledgement with a fuller response to
Greenpeace's questions, I suggest we consider the following issues raised
recently by Jackie Gentle:

""In response to several requests for clarification, I have spoken with Mark
Palmer who has provided the following information on Enron's stance
regarding Kyoto:

Enron has always taken the view that the Kyoto protocol was not a workable
solution to dealing with CO2 emissions.  However it is not the principles
behind Kyoto that we take issue with, rather it is the vehicle that has
been devised to deliver the results.

We firmly believe that there is work to be done in reducing greenhouse
gases and Enron has put in place a number of programs that have measurably
reduced carbon dioxide as well as SO2 and Oxides of Nitrogen (Nox)

By way of example ....
   emissions trading programs have been put in place where these can be
   implemented
   Enron is one of the largest developers of natural gas-fired power plants
   which produce about 50 percent less carbon dioxide than coal or
   oil-fired plants
   demand-side management programs through EES to reduce energy usage
   the Catalytica program
   focus on renewable-related projects

At the current time there is no formal statement from Enron Corp on the
Kyoto issue.""

Before we proceed, I would be grateful if you could contact me to share
your views on this.

Many thanks.
Best regards
Kate

is before 26 April.  I am asking our PR agency in the NL to translate the
letter asap.

In the mean time, I will wait for direction on our official corporate
response on this issue and then discuss suitability or possible adaptation
for the Dutch market or for this letter in particular.

I have advised Hans-Mart to make sure all employees in the Dutch office do
not reply to any calls or queries re the above ubject and to refer them to
me.

Thanks

Two questions.  Any word as to whether or not SoCal has taken a definite position?  Secondly, assuming Transwestern files its own comments in support of the PD, could you help us make the filing?  Greg Porter, our attorney is drafting the comments today however we may not have it ready until tomorrow.  Thanks.

As requested, Mark Baldwin has put together a summary of the Proposed Decision and Comment Points for filing on Friday.  Below are his comments which we can use for discussion purposes at the conference call later this morning.  Having reviewed the Proposed Decision I would agree with Mark's assessment in that while we may prefer that the Commission not modify the Comprehensive Settlement, overall the modifications made should not negatively impact Transwestern.  The Proposed Decision retains two important aspects of the CS for Transwestern:  1)  Unbundling of the SoCal backbone transmission system and receipt point capacity and 2) Retention of primary firm RP capacity of 750MM/d at Needles from Transwestern.  gh

Subject:	Bilas , Proposed Decision SoCal GIR

Glen,

I have reviewed the 10/10/01 Revised PD of Comr. Bilas as requested. In view
of the entirety of TW's interest ,I still ascertain that TW can support the
current 10/10 PD. Noted below for your information and review is a summary
of the Modifications to the CSA that Bilas is currently offering :


1)Market concentration limits reduced from 40% to 30 % of available receipt
point capacity. TW has preferred no limits to market concentration
historically. However, as before, I do not believe pushing this issue will
be successful or productive for TW. There are no market concentration limits
in the secondary market. (Although Bilas warns market participants that any
misbehavior will be subject to CPUC investigation) P.44

2)SoCal will be required to make available on a daily basis any unutilized
firm RP capacity. I don't see any negative impact on TW, perhaps positive.
P.45

3)Price Cap for secondary intrastate market set at 120 % of SoCal firm rate.
This is the same cap that applies to SoCal. I don't like the precedent set
in this area, however it assures that the economic value allocation between
SoCal citygate and supply basin will proportionately tend toward the
interstate system providers in any tight transport/supply scenario. P.46

4)Not really a change , but Bilas mentions support for Hector Rd. as a
delivery/receipt at Ferc.

5)PD does not reduce the core's interstate capacity nor their storage
capacities but rather maintains these capacities at current levels. Current
level 1044 MMcfd, proposed 1000 MMcfd on the interstate system and current
storage 70 BCF, 327 MMcfd of injection and 1,935 MMcfd withdrawal Vs
proposed 55 BCF.  I see no clear negative impact on TW from this change.P.
52 &54.

6) CTA's (Core Transport Agents) allowed to reject only their prorata share
of non-reliability storage service. No impact on TW interests. P. 58

7) SoCal directed to present(via Advice Ltr.) how the cost of noncore
default balancing will be allocated ONLY to those noncore customer using
this service and not to the Core customers. I see no impact on TW. P.62

8)PD rejects the requirement that SoCal/SDG&E file an application with a
proposal to address core procurement function as the default provider.  I
see only positive attributes of this change for TW. P.63

9)Preserves the right for SoCal/SDG&E to seek recovery of expenditures
associated with the transfers of customers from Core to Core Aggregator. NO
impact on TW. P.66

10)PD orders a 10 % cap on ITCS (stranded cost)responsibility borne by
bundled core customers due to unbundled core interstate capacity. No direct
impact upon TW interest, however, likely a touchy point with noncore
interest. P. 75

11) PD orders that the core contribution to noncore ITCS will end effective
the adoption of the PD. Additionally, noncore customers to pay 50% of core
ITCS till the end of the core TW and EPNG agreements. No negative impact on
TW. Noncore customers bear additional expense. The PD estimates an
additional $18 million over next 5 to 6 years. P. 78 The PD provides an
estimate of increased stranded cost for the noncore between 01 and 06 to be
approx. $ 44.4 Million.

12) PD say NO to an increase in the core brokerage fee of $ 0.0039 (to $2.4
cents). No impact on TW interest. P.83.

13) PD treats Core Subscription service differently on an accounting basis.
No impact on TW. P.85-87

14)Generally, the PD makes some administrative changes to the small core/ESP
market rules and SoCal services and consumer protection implementation . NO
impact on TW interest. P 88-100.

15)Lots of tweaking on how SoCal can recover the cost to implement to
services envisioned under the CSA. Owing to the fact that SoCal has already
started to ""implement"" portions of the CSA and those cost are accruing to a
balancing account etc. Bottomline, not consequential to the approval of the
PD. No direct impact upon TW interest. P. 103-110.


On whole the centerpiece of TW's interest in this proceeding remains intact.
The SoCal receipt points are unbundled along with ""SoCal backbone
facilities"". TW has primary firm RP of no less than 750 mmfcd. Mojave is
recognized at only 50 mmfcd firm RP. No receipt point complex is given a
preference for capacity expansion. Line 235 appears to remain useful for TW
deliveries into the market load centers. The PD modifications to the CSA do
not impose upon TW any conditions or costs that would be reason not to
support the PD. The parties most affected by the PD are the core aggregators
with additional costs and restrictions to service options and noncore
customers with additional cost allocations.


Points for comments

1) TW agrees with the PD that the centerpiece of positive changes embodied
in the CSA in the creation of firm tradable RP rights. This change in SoCal
market structure provides all market participants with the proper tools to
build long term supply and transportation contracts.

2) Further adoption of the PD substantially reduces unnecessary market
inefficiencies at the California border by providing all market participants
with gas scheduling certainty.

3) The creation of tradable secondary rights on SoCal's intrastate system
will promote competition and generally lead to stable delivered gas prices.

4) The PD correctly observes that the PG&E market structure which relieves
upon an unbundled intrastate backbone system work ""relatively well"" during
California's challenging energy markets.

5)TW agrees that the time is ripe for approval of the PD. The energy markets
in California have been improving and stabilizing. The Commission promising
options are still valid in today's gas market. Further, SoCal is already
starting to follow the CSA game plan in their attempts to improve the
operating environment on the SoCal system. It is consistent to follow
through and make the structural changes required to make permanent these
improvements.

6)TW supports SoCal and others whom are approving this PD. (ON THIS POINT,
TW SHOULD BE SURE THAT SOCAL IS ON BOARD AS WELL AS OTHER CSA SIGNATORIES,
PRIOR TO FILING THESE TYPE COMMENTS)


I look forward to discussing these matters tomorrow on the conference call.

Mark, IGS.

I read the chapter. Generally,
I like it, and find it non-controversial
and well written. Of course, this is
a huge topic and there are things
that you haven't discussed.

I thought the amount of attention
paid to OLS and MLE estimation
was a bit overboard, given that you
didn't really exploit it in your
results. If you were to state
the likelihood function for
the GARCH model, it might justify
the amount of attention to
gave to estimation for
simple iid processes, which could then
be thought of as a simple lead-in
and intuition builder to
the more interesting models that
you do actually use.

By the way, in your discussion of
smiles, you discuss fat tails
extensively. At least for equity markets,
while fat tails contribute, they don't do very
much at all compared to the effect
of risk premia, which you allude to briefly,
using supply-demand language, at the
end of that section.

For the impact of risk premia, see
Jun Pan's paper, which is available
from her web page. But she covers
only SP500, (as do most studies),
and your markets are obviously much different.

The chapter will be a good service to your readers!

Best, Darrell

DISCRETIONARY LOAD CURTAILMENT PROGRAM

The California Independent System Operator (ISO) has created the=20

This program provides an energy-only payment and gives Loads total control=

Load Aggregators will receive the performance payments from the ISO through=

their elected Scheduling Coordinator. =20
The DLCP will operate year-round during the hours of 7:00AM until 8:00PM fr=

=20
throughout 2001 and implemented for 2002 if needed. Some provisions includi=

Summer 2001 experience. =20
The ISO is accepting proposals from those interested in being a Load=20

program. For more information and a copy of the Request for Proposals, plea=

Eligibility
DLCP Load Aggregator
In order to be eligible for the DLCP, Load Aggregators (including UDCs):
1. Must be able to provide a portfolio that contains a net reduction in=20
Demand of at least 1MW, either alone or when aggregated with other customer=
s,
2. Must sign a DLCP Agreement,
3. Must have an ISO approved performance measurement process,=20
4. Must be capable of interacting with the ISO=01,s DLCP infrastructure as =
well=20
as communicate with the end-use Load customer,
5. Must nominate an SC for settlement transactions with the ISO.

DLCP End-Use Load Customer
In order to be eligible for the DLCP, an end-use Load customer:
1. Must be able to provide a net reduction in Demand that meets the criteri=
a=20
of the LA, or the Local Regulatory Authority,
2. Must have an interval meter approved by the Local Regulatory Authority, =
or=20
have the appropriate measuring device(s) as required by the approved LA=01,=
s=20
performance measurement process,
3. Must be located inside the ISO Control Area (ask your LA, if you are not=
=20
sure),
4. Must not concurrently participate in the ISO=01,s Summer 2001 DRP, howev=
er=20
may participate during months outside of the DRP contracted period (May=20
15-September 30, 2001),=20
5. If the end-use load is a UDC interruptible customer, the customer may=20
participate in the DLCP as long as the customer has met all the contractual=
=20
obligations of an interruptible customer,
6. Must not have a Participating Load Agreement (PLA) with the ISO for the=
=20
same Load offered under the DLCP,
7. Must obtain and provide positive proof of all necessary permits of=20
operation or approvals from the local Air Pollution Control District or Air=
=20
Quality Management District for each individual Generating Unit designated=
=20
for participation in the DLCP.=20

DLCP Process:
? DLCP Request
1. DLCP Day Ahead Request:
The ISO will project the need for demand response. The ISO may call on this=
=20
program based upon the best temperature, load, and resource forecast=20
information available by 4:00PM the day ahead.  The ISO will issue a DLCP D=
ay=20
Ahead Request by e-mail to all contracted Load Aggregators.  The e-mail=20
notice will request the curtailment amounts for two-hour blocks within the=
=20
ISO specified curtailment timeframe.  The ISO will provide any constraints =
in=20
the notice.
2. DLCP Day Of Request:
The ISO will project the need for demand response.  The ISO will base this=
=20
projection upon the best temperature, load, and resource forecast informati=
on=20
available by 8:00AM of the day of the request. The ISO will issue a DLCP Da=
y=20
Of Request by e-mail to all Load Aggregators.  The e-mail notice will reque=
st=20
the curtailment amounts for each two-hour block requested.  The ISO will=20
provide any constraints in the notice.

? DLCP Offer
1. By 6:00PM on the Day Ahead, the Load Aggregators will submit to the ISO,=
=20
through the ISO DLCP website, their committed amounts of Load Curtailment. =
=20
The ISO expects that the Load Aggregators will have contacted the End-Use=
=20
Loads in their program to determine how much curtailment will be available=
=20
and for which hours of the day.=20
2. By 9:00AM of the Day Of, the Load Aggregators will submit their committe=
d=20
amounts of curtailment. =20

? DLCP Confirmation
Once the ISO reviews submitted DLCP Offers, ISO Operations will issue an=20
e-mail notice to both the Load Aggregators and their Scheduling Coordinator=
s=20
accepting specific DLCP Offers.  The ISO will issue the DLCP Confirmation=
=20
notice by 7:00PM on the day the Day Ahead Request was made and by 9:30AM fo=
r=20
the Day Of Requests. These confirmation notices will request that the Load=
=20
Aggregators communicate to the End-Use Loads the required curtailment amoun=
t=20
and duration.  This will be the only communication (dispatch) to the Load=
=20
Aggregators detailing the curtailment. =20
? DLCP Performance
The effectiveness of the DLCP will be based on the performance of each=20
End-Use Load in curtailing their confirmed curtailment amount. The ISO=20
expects that the committed curtailment will occur based on the hours as=20
confirmed through the DLCP Confirmation notices.  An aggregator has the=20
responsibility to produce the demand reduction it confirms.  There is no se=
t=20
penalty, except that continued poor performance could result in revocation =
of=20
the DLCP Agreement. =20

? Performance Measurement Guidelines
The measurement of performance for each End-Use Load will be performed by t=
he=20
Load Aggregators.  Each Load Aggregator will have an ISO approved performan=
ce=20
measurement plan, which will be used to calculate the DLCP performance.  Th=
e=20
performance measurement plan shall include the following:
? For interval metered End-Use Loads the Load Aggregator will calculate a=
=20
baseline Load profile.  DLCP performance will be measured by the difference=
=20
between baseline Load profile and the meter read for the hour(s) of=20
curtailment. =20
? For non-interval metered Loads, DLCP performance will be calculated by=20
using a combination of sample measurements, historic data, process controls=
,=20
use of data loggers, and any other performance measurement method approved =
by=20
the ISO.  Load Aggregators shall obtained ISO approval prior to offering DL=
CP=20
for non-interval metered End-Use Loads.  (It should be noted that the ISO=
=20
favors interval meters.)
? DLCP Settlement
Each DLCP Offer for which a DLCP Confirmation was issued by the ISO shall b=
e=20
uniquely identified.  Therefore, DLCP Day Ahead and DLCP Day Of offers must=
=20
be separately identified. The Load Aggregators (except for the UDCs) shall=
=20
submit the DLCP Performance Measurement for each confirmed offer by using t=
he=20
DLCP website no later than 45 days following the operating day of the DLCP=
=20
Curtailment.  The ISO will calculate the performance payment by simply=20
multiplying the DLCP energy price ($500/MWh for DLCP Day Ahead and $750/MWh=
=20
for DLCP Day Of) by the amount of DLCP (in MWs) for each hour of confirmed=
=20
curtailment. For each month the performance payments will be summed up for=
=20
all the confirmed curtailments and paid to the Load Aggregator=01,s nominat=
ed=20
Scheduling Coordinator.  The payment will be made to the Scheduling=20
Coordinator in accordance to the ISO Payment Calendar timeline. =20
The ISO recognizes that UDCs acting as Load Aggregators will have specific=
=20
rules to follow for the settlement of the dispatched curtailment.  The UDCs=
=20
will be responsible for following the settlement rules and regulations set=
=20
forth by the CPUC for the End-Use Loads. =20

Just a reminder that ENA received a letter from Tri-State last month and you are going to verify that Deal Nos. YB 5708.1 and 5833.1 are the only active financial deals with ENA.  If you can confirm, then we can indicate on the Master Log that Tri-State has actually terminated all outstanding trades effective as of 2/27/02.

"Given that we are already well into the Summer of '01, it now appears that 
further CDWR contracting will only lock CA into high prices.  The original 
idea was that CDWR could buy power at $80/mwh and ensure that retail rates 
wouldn't go higher.  Neither of these concepts have held true.

I think that Enron needs to consider actively oppossing any further 
contracting and a bond issuance in light of the potential harm that CDWR will 
do.  First, the prices they are getting won't be great for customers.  
Second, with the ""new"" stranded costs that will be created, direct access in 
the future won't have a chance.

Appreciate everyone's thoughts?

From the contract specification documentation provided by the OM to us I 
would say that for the ""pulpex futures contract"", reference to the term
""Daily Settlement Price"" is the same as reference to ""daily closing price"" or 
""last traded price"" for the Pulpex Futures Contract after reading contract 
specification section 2.1.13 of their documentation.  The OM simply defines 
it as the last traded price on each business day.  However, ""Daily Settlment 
Price"" for the pulpex options contract per contract specification 2.2.6 
defines it as the mid price of the closing bid and offer price.  
Give me your fax number and I'll send the documentation to you for review.

That being said I think your floating price language is OK and we should move 
forward in order to close the books on this one.

Thanks for your help.

		 Subject: Re: Rumour of CPUC Action on AB 1 Direct Access Suspension Language 
This Week

All:
It is my understanding, from good sources in the Govs office that the Gov
will order Loretta Lynch to expeditiously implement the provision to suspend
all parties auhtority to enter into direct access contracts.  The premise
with which the administartion is acting is that if they expeditiously
suspend everyone's right to bilateral contracts quickly, it sets up a
barrier which the direct access coalition must break through.  In other
words the table is set.  Deal your meal from where the dishes are located.
I.E. the Davis Administration wants to place all direct access advocates in
the position of having to justify why each and every party should be the
exception to the suspension rather than have a general rule concerning how
direct access should work for all parties.  It clearly gives the Admin a
very strong upper hand to control who when and where direct access can occur
without having to say that they oppose direct access.  Power be where power
lies.

Subject: EIX. PCG: QFs Prepare to File SCE Involuntary Bankruptcy Next Week

Credit Suisse First Boston
Paul Patterson
Good morning,
? Yesterday, Coram, a QF, said that it signed a petition to file involuntary 
bankruptcy against Southern California Edison. Reportedly, the petition is 
under review by five other renewable QFs.  Apparently, certain gas-fired QFs 
are now forming a second petitioner group.
? We believe that it should be fairly easy for Coram to collect the two other 
signatures needed to make a petition valid. Whether the petition will 
actually be filed is unclear since the QFs may only be attempting to expedite 
a resolution for the utilities and themselves.
? On Wednesday, a federal court allowed Caithness, another QF, to place a 
lien on an Edison asset, thus giving it a secured claim effective in 90 days. 
Edison is filing an appeal and an automatic stay of decision.
? The Caithness decision may prompt Edison's other unsecured creditors to 
seek similar motions. As we previously indicated, we believe that QFs pose 
the greatest risk of filing involuntary bankruptcy against the utilities 
because of their dire financial situation.
? Although Governor Davis and the utilities purportedly continue to negotiate 
a recovery plan, there is no assurance of legislative cooperation. In 
addition, we expect news of the petition to cause near-term weakness in the 
utilities' stocks. Therefore, we recommend that investors avoid EIX ($13.59, 
Hold) and PCG ($12.92, Hold), unless they have a high tolerance for risk and 
volatility.

Please call us with any questions you may have.

"Professor Titman:
 I would like to thank you for taking the time to recommend me to the MBA 
Program.  In the end, the results were not favorable.  I understand that it 
is a competitive process, but I felt that with my work experiences, 
recommendations, extrcurricular activities, etc., that this would help my 
chances and possibly compensate my disability.  After talking with you and 
Professors Ronn, Brown and Jemison, I was sure that UT was the right place to 
continue learning about energy-finance.  
  I am still sure that UT is the place for getting an excellent 
graduate-level education, so I want you to know that I am going to do what 
ever it takes to get in next year.  I plan on taking a couple of graduate 
level finance courses at the University of Houston this Summer and Fall to 
demonstrate to the Admissions office that I can compete at this level. I also 
plan on trying to retake the GMAT test.  Due to my disability, this will be a 
monumental task, but I am determined to prove to the Admissions committment 
that I can do the work at The Texas University Graduate School of Business.
 Also, I would like to continue our dialague regarding creating an 
Energy-Finance Private Equity Fund at UT.  I know that with my industry-wide 
and investment banking contacts that I can help raise capital for the fund.  
I am very interested in energy-finance and think that your idea is a very 
good.  
 Thanks again for taking the time to listen and talk with me.  It has been a 
pleasure to meet with you and I hope we can continue to talk about energy and 
finance in the future.  Also, if you think of anything else I can do to 
strengthen my overall application file for next year, please let me know.  
Take care and hope to hear from you soon.

Sincerely,

Ben Rogers

Stu,
I am sure you will be aware from your market intelligence of the problems at 
FF
Unit 2, which we are advised is an event of Force Majeur. I believe it would 
be
counter-productive to the spirit of current negotiations to prosecute an FM
claim and do not therefore propose to do so at this time. However, in the 
event
of an unsatisfactory outcome to these negotiations we do reserve the right to
ultimately pursue a Force Majeur claim in respect of the failure of FF Unit 2.
I am also holding back FF's claim for mill damage from the rogue cargo of hard
La Loma coal on the same principle.
Please respond if you disagree with this approach.
Regards
Max

Valuing dot-coms after the fall
The Internet roller coaster may rank as the market's most dramatic
upheaval over the past 20 years, but it certainly hasn't been the only
one. Remember biotech? Real estate? Leveraged buyouts? What about Japan
Incorporated? Sooner or later, investment values always revert to a
fundamental level based on cash flows. Get used to it.
http://mckinseyquarterly.com/login.asp?ArtID=1015


Mobile portals mobilize for scale
As investors have cooled to new ventures, survival is now at the top of
the agenda for mobile portals. Whether a portal stays alive will depend on
its ability to offer accessibility, awareness, and the right services. The
rest of the struggle---rapid expansion to ensure long-term survival and,
eventually, global dominion---will come down to guts and determination.
http://mckinseyquarterly.com/login.asp?ArtID=1022


The innovative organization
The idea that new businesses prosper best when separated from their
corporate parents has now become conventional wisdom. Although new
ventures do need space to develop, strict separation can prevent them from
obtaining invaluable resources and rob their parents of the vitality they
can generate. The solution? A balance of partitioning and integration.

Programmers abroad: A primer on offshore software development
More and more companies are going offshore to develop and maintain their
software. The reason is simple: this approach saves time and money.
Without discipline in managing offshore relationships, however, a company
not only can squander the cost and time savings it had hoped to gain but
also may face late deliveries, escalating costs, mismatches between
expectations and deliverables, and even outright failure.

I refer to our recent conversation relating to the progress of ISDA 
negotiations with the above counterparty.

I have just spoken to Carine Lavergne at SITA.  She informs me that SITA does 
not feel adequately equipped or informed to progress the negotiations 
internally and therefore intends to appoint external counsel (I urged her to 
do this as soon as possible).  Despite this intended appointment, she assured 
me that SITA wishes to enter into the ISDA as soon as possible and is keen to 
keep negotiations to a minimum.

Either I or Michael Khajeh-Noori will keep you updated as to the progress.

For your information, I also attach a status report with respect to the 
counterparties with whom Michael and I are currently negotiating.



Let me know if you need anything else.

Thanx for the quick response.  

I really want to provide Jose the opportunity to be heard and discuss theory more than specific details.  A lunch or breakfast informal meeting would suffice.  

If your Karma continues to work, we may start strategically place you on 32 for AGA days or I may keep you for customer negotiations in 4th quarter.

Laura,

We can definitely help Jose. We are producing the demand projections for
natural gas by state, by customer class every day. The projections
are used to forecast AGA storage numbers and have a very
good history of hitting the right number. This validate svery well the
demand model.

Getting the supply curve at a specific location is more difficult because
other regions are competing for the same finite quantity of gas
available in the short run. We have some good insights into this
problem as well.

My concern is that summer associates are not fully committed to Enron.
I have about 7-8 summer associates every year and we always take measures
to keep them away from critical information.
Please, let me know how far we can go with Jose.

I am ready to help you with baseball. I went to a game last week
and Astros won. I guess I brought some good Karma.

Hope all is well with you.  If this baseball season continues to develop, we may need you in Chicago...

I have a summer associate in Houston, Jose Molina, who has inquired regarding Enron's ability to develop a supply/demand  curve.  In our group (Gas Fundamentals/Trading/Origination) we spend a significant amount of time and effort tracking correlations in an array of price/supply/demand scenarios.  Jose is questioning if we can take this more specifically to a scientific approach.  I recommended that he spend time with your or someone in your group to develop his idea and determine feasibility.

I would appreciate if someone could schedule time with Jose.  I always want to encourage an inquisitive nature.

Let me know.

Hedy, Scott, Bev -  the language currently says the bond surcharge will apply ""to all electric power delivered in California by electric corporations ...""  I know this is a longshot, but is there any chance of having this amended to either 

1) exclude volumes under DA contracts as of the effective date of this act, or 
2) more generally leave it to the PUC to adjust the surcharge for customer classes based on their contribution - or lack thereof - to DWR's purchasing requirements.

The justification for this exemption is grounded in excluding customers who have not caused the DWR problem; e.g. large San Diego customers or PGE/SCE customers who have been DA  the last couple years or parts thereof.  (We can give you some specific language.)

granted some level of authority to execute CA's, Master Agreements, etc. that 
have been reviewed and approved by legal.  If you can at least pull the

"According to Kimat, TP2 gets the NYPA sale at Mamou at the prices show below.  We have 3 options on serving this deal: 
1) buy Texas Gas capacity and ship the gas on a secondary basis from the Zone SL Pool
2) use Transco Zone 3 wellhead
3) buy Trco capacity and ship the gas on a secondary basis from St 65

Most of the time we use option #1.  Texas Gas is cheaper than Trco even after paying the transport cost.  However, this deal comes to the TP2 book at the prices listed below.  For April, TP2 purchased the gas from GULF2 at the Zone SL IF + $.005 and shipped it to Mamou.  The total transport cost  is $.02 (including demand - this changes each month).  We don't arb the supply with Trco and Texas Gas because NYPA is extremely difficult to work with and this is a term firm sale to NYPA.

Should we change the mid price for the NYPA to include both the Zone SL mid price  and the transport expense?

"I spoke with Susan Bulgawicz again today.  She relates the following points:

Gensler has been subcontracted to do interior space planning and design for 
the new building generally
While our work is probably in addition to that already agreed (and will 
therefore be billed to us) it should be covered by an amendment to the 
existing agreement rather than a new, separate agreement
Bill Donovan feels that the design and space planning work should be done as 
near in time as possible to the actual construction work to avoid having to 
redo the work (and pay twice) to take into account new factors not apparent 
earlier (e.g. organizational and technology changes)
Bill's view is that we are 3 to 6 months premature at this point in doing 
this work for the legal department

Susan suggested that you might want to call Bill to discuss this and talk 
about how you want to move forward."

"Gouger Gray Davis 
California's petulant governor ignores reality as he overpays for electricity

LANCE T. IZUMI Mr. Izumi is a senior fellow in California Studies at the San 
Francisco- based Pacific Research Institute.
On the surface, things seem to be going pretty good for Gov. Gray Davis with 
regard to California's electricity crisis. The governor has scored some nice 
publicity by switching on some new power plants. The weather has been 
unseasonably cool. His poll numbers are edging back up. Yet beneath this 
optimistic picture lie troubling problems. For example, Davis's argument that 
out-of-state power generators are responsible for the electricity crisis has 
been falling apart. For months, Davis has been claiming that private 
generators have overcharged California by $8.9 billion and demanded that this 
amount be refunded to the state. However, after a two-week mediation between 
state officials and the generators, Curtis Wagner, the federal government's 
chief energy regulatory judge, rebuked Davis's claim saying that such a huge 
overcharge ""has not and cannot be substantiated."" Further, while the 
generators may be liable to refund a much smaller amount to the state, 
perhaps $1 billion, Wagner said that generators are owed more money by the 
state than they owe the state in refunds: ""Can a cash refund be required 
where a much larger amount is due the seller? The chief judge thinks not."" 
Davis reacted to the judge's ruling by calling it a ""raw deal"" and by urging 
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to ignore the lack of evidence and 
the judge's conclusions and to ""step up and provide the refunds we've asked 
for."" Davis's position, as usual, is motivated purely by politics. Indeed, 
Dan Walters of the Sacramento Bee says that Davis is operating in a 
""melodramatic virtual world"" de-linked from reality. 
Davis's blame-the-generators argument took another body blow when newly 
released documents showed that, on average, major out-of-state power 
companies such as Enron, Duke, Dynergy and Mirant charged less than the 
average prices paid by the state during the first three months of the year. 
California government utilities, on the other hand, such as the Los Angeles 
Department of Water and Power and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District 
(SMUD), charged the state much more for electricity than the out-of-state 
generators. For example, while Texas-based Enron, a favorite Davis whipping 
boy, charged an average $181 per megawatt hour, SMUD charged an average $330 
per megawatt hour. 
Davis responded to this revelation in typical political fashion. A Davis 
spokesman said that the governor had expressed his anger at ""the generators 
who wear cowboy hats"" and that ""just because there are other entities that 
are charging us more doesn't change the fact that we are getting ripped off 
by companies from Houston, Tulsa, Atlanta or Charlotte."" 
Yet, for all Davis' feigned indignation about consumers being ripped off, it 
turns out that he and his regulators are poised to ensure that business 
consumers are ripped off by state government. Davis has signed $43 billion in 
ill-advised long-term purchase contracts at rates above-market-price. The 
state must, therefore, ensure that enough business customers remain in the 
current state-controlled distribution system to pay for high-priced state 
power purchases. This is especially important to Davis since the high prices 
are borne disproportionately by business. Thus, Davis' regulators are set to 
eliminate ""direct access,"" which allows businesses to shop for cheaper power. 
Who's the real gouger? No matter how much Davis points the finger, 
Californians are paying dearly for his political opportunism and bad 
policies. "

Hopefully everyone got their invitation to her party and now you can all
throw them away.  If you were coming to the party it has been cancelled b/c
Michaela is very sick.  Carrie took off today to take her to the doctor with
my mom and I'm not sure how she will be feeling by this weekend.  So we
think the best thing to do is just cancel and she just wont get any cake.
We are a little worried about her so say a prayer and hopefully all will be
okay.

ISO Market Participants:

On March 7, 2001, the ISO distributed funds from the March 5 market
settlement of the December 2000 preliminary invoice.  The ISO distributed a
total of $45,779,567.97, of which $352,693.64 was applied to outstanding
November balances, and $45,426,874.33 was applied to December balances, as
shown below.   Total amounts payable to Market Participants related to the
December preliminary invoice were $1,490,781,469.67.  Accordingly, the
preliminary pay-out ratio for December was 3.05%, and the cumulative
November pay-out was 24.22%.

Additionally, the ISO received $171,116,114.43 ($177 million less GMC
obligation) directly from PG&E.  PG&E indicated the funds were to be applied
in payment of California Power Exchange (""Cal PX"") obligations.  The ISO has
been contacted by the Cal PX, and they have indicated they believe they are
entitled to such funds and that such funds are subject to a pending action
in federal court entitled ""Enron Power Marketing, Inc. and Enron Corp. v.
California Power Exchange Corporation"", Case No. 01-00901CM (Central
District of  California.  The Cal PX has indicated they plan to seek an
order within the next 7-10 days with the Court to have the funds transferred
to the Cal PX for deposit into an escrow account pursuant to Judge Moreno's
Preliminary Injunction.   These funds are being held by the ISO in a
segregated interest bearing account pending resolution of this issue by that
court.

Payments were made in accordance with ISO Tariff Section 11 and Settlements
and Billing Protocol (""SABP"") Section 6.

Illinova remain in default for GMC obligation.

The distributions were made in accordance with the following tariff
provision:

 11.16.1 Pro Rata Reduction of Payments.
 If it is not possible to clear the ISO Clearing Account on a Payment
Date because of an insufficiency of funds available in the ISO Reserve
Account or by enforcing any guarantee, letter of credit or other credit
support provided by a defaulting Scheduling Coordinator, the ISO shall
reduce payments to all ISO Creditors proportionately to the net amounts
payable to them on the relevant Payment Data to the extent necessary to
clear the ISO Clearing Account.  The ISO shall account for such reduction in
the ISO ledger accounts as amounts due and owing by the non-paying ISO
Debtor to each ISO Creditor whose payment was so reduced.

As noted above, certain parties have defaulted on their GMC obligations to
the ISO.  The ISO has a priority claim to the collection of its GMC.  As a
result of non-payment of the GMC by the parties listed above, the ISO
reduced the amounts payable to market participants by a total of $591,798.59
to satisfy the ISO's GMC obligation.  This action was consistent with
Settlements and Billing Protocol section 6.3.1.3.  Additionally, for those
parties who defaulted on their GMC obligation to the ISO, but who were to
receive funds from the market, the ISO has reduced their payout to reflect
their GMC default.

 SABP 6.3.1.3
 The ISO is authorized to instruct the ISO Bank to debit the ISO
Clearing Account and transfer to the relevant ISO account sufficient funds
to pay in full the Grid Management Charge falling due on any Payment Day in
priority to any other payments to be made on that or on subsequent days out
of the ISO Clearing Account.

Amounts collected from any party are first used to settle that party's
oldest outstanding amount payable, in accordance with SABP 6.10.4:

 SABP 6.10.4
 The ISO shall apply payments received in respect of amounts owing to
ISO Creditors to repay the relevant debts in the order of the creation of
such debts.

Accordingly, amounts received on 3/5/2001, were distributed to November 2000
and December 2000 creditors.  Payments received from parties who defaulted
in November were first applied to their November balances.  The $352,693.64
was distributed to creditors for the trade month of November 2000.

In accordance with Section 11.12 (and SABP 6.10.5) of the tariff, the ISO
will assess the defaulting parties interest at the ISO Default Interest Rate
(currently 10.5%:  prime plus 2%).

Certifications are required by Section 11.20.2 of the tariff.  Accordingly,
the ISO will provide such certification to ISO creditors.

 11.20.2 Evidence of Unpaid Amount.
 The ISO shall, on request, certify in writing the amounts owed by an
ISO Debtor that remain unpaid and the ISO Creditors to whom such amounts are
owed and shall provide certified copies of the relevant Preliminary and
Final Settlement Statements, invoices, and other documentation on which the
ISO's certificate was based to the ISO Debtor and the relevant ISO
Creditors.  An ISO certificate given under this Section 11.20.2 may be used
as prima facie evidence of the amount due by an ISO Debtor to ISO Creditors
in any legal proceeding.

The ISO will report further details on this situation when available.

Calif Power Consultant Failed To Reveal Energy Co. Stake


By JASON LEOPOLD

   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

LOS ANGELES -- A top energy consultant hired by to negotiate long-term power contracts for the state of California failed to disclose that he held stock in a company with which the state signed a $1 billion power supply pact last month, according to documents obtained Thursday by Dow Jones Newswires.

Vikram Budraja filed an amended financial disclosure form Aug. 13 listing holdings of between $2,000 and $10,000 in stock in ScottishPower (SPI), whose subsidiary PacifiCorp Power Marketing signed a $1 billion, 10-year power contract with the state Department of Water Resources on July 6.

Budraja failed to disclose the information in a form he filed in July, after energy consultants hired by Gov. Gray Davis came under fire for failing to file routine financial disclosure forms.

Budraja's August economic disclosure form states that he sold his ScottishPower shares July 30 on the advice of his lawyer. He purchased the shares ""pre-96,"" according to the form.

Davis's office has sent a copy of Budraja's amended filing to the state's Fair Political Practices Committee for review, said Bill Kissinger, Deputy Legal Affairs adviser for Davis.

The FPPC is conducting an investigation into a handful of the DWR's consultants who held stock in energy companies while working on behalf of the state buying power and negotiating contracts, Kissinger said.

The DWR, which is handling the job of buying power in lieu of California's insolvent utilities, said Budraja didn't negotiate the contract with PacifiCorp. The department disclosed the contract on Aug. 17.

Stephen Kaufman, a lawyer representing the Electric Power Group and Budraja, also said Budraja didn't help negotiate the contract. Kaufman added that Budraja's ScottishPower holdings were tied up in an IRA and that Budraja hadn't even realized he held stock in the company until a review of his financial records was undertaken recently.

""A decision was made upon reviewing all of Mr. Budraja's assets to disclose this to the public given all the activities going on and the press accounts,"" Kaufman said. ""The signing of the contract was of no consequence in deciding whether or not it should be sold. This was a very small holding that was part of an IRA purchased prior to 1996. He did not remember or realize he had this holding until after this situation blew up and took a look at all of his holdings.""

     Political Battle Continues

Budraja included the following comment with his renewed filing:

""The information contained in the two previously filed form 700s was provided pursuant to a series of instructions provided by the Department of Water Resources starting on June 15, 2001, that my disclosure should reflect the facts that existed on the date you first began working for the California Energy Resources Scheduling,"" Budraja wrote, referring to the Department of Water Resources' power-buying arm. ""This amended form is filed to list information not previously provided based upon consultation with and advice of legal counsel regarding the disclosure required by the Political Reform Act.""

The disclosure is the latest in a battle over possible conflicts of interest waged by Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican who hopes to challenge Davis, a Democrat, next year for governor.

Jones began pressing consultants hired by Davis' administration in July to disclose their shareholdings in energy companies. Once they did, Jones asked federal and state regulators to investigate possible insider trading and conflicts of interest.

Budraja, a former Edison International (EIX) vice president, is one of the state's two main power-contract negotiators. Electric Power Group is under contract to plan and execute the DWR's power purchases and to help coordinate between the agency and other state offices. His firm has 10 employees under contract to the DWR. Electric Power Group is to receive $6.2 million for those services through Dec. 31, 2002.

As reported, investigators with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission are looking into Budraja's shareholdings. The consultant has confirmed receiving a letter from the SEC informing him of the inquiry and asking him to supply information regarding his investments as of Jan. 1.

In July, Budraja disclosed holding in Edison International and Dynegy Inc. (DYN), both of which he sold after he began working for the state.

The state's contract with PacifiCorp was negotiated by Richard Ferreira, the former Sacramento Municipal Utility District executive, and a representative from Navigant consulting, said DWR spokesman Oscar Hidalgo.

Ferreira was fired in late July because he held stock in Calpine Corp. (CPN) while negotiating long-term contracts with the company, according to Davis' office.

The Republican leadership in the state Legislature has called for oversight hearings into the state's $43 billion in long-term power contracts, as well as its spot-market purchases. The Democratic majority has yet to respond to the request.

"Scott:
Here are the foundations that ARM will use in its appeal of the PUC decision suspending DA (and threats to make it retroactive to July 1).  You should feel free to share with the business folks but under the condition that they keep it confidential.  And of course, we'd be thrilled if they'd sign on.  If you have any questions, just holler.
Best,

The primary reasons cited for why rehearing should be granted are as follows: 
The Decision violates procedural due process guarantees. 
The failure to hold hearings violates Public Utilities Code section 1708.5(f). 
The Commission's reliance on material outside the record violates due process. 
The Decision violates the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. 
The threatened retroactivity is contrary to law and in excess of the Commission's authority. 
The Commission acted contrary to law and in excess of its authority. 
The Decision's purported findings are not supported. 
The Commission has impermissibly converted a ratemaking proceeding into a quasi-legislative proceeding."

"Per our discussion this morning, below is a summary of items to discuss with 
Glynn:

Adding Enron's ""negative CTC claim"" to the list of claims: PGE's filing 
included a list of top twenty creditors.  Our negative CTC claim was 
apparently not taken into account in compiling that list.  The list is 
nonbinding, however.  PG&E will be required to file schedules of creditors on 
April 20.  Our negative CTC claim should be on Schedule F (for unsecured 
claims).  You may want to remind Glynn of your previous conversations and 
state our expectation that the negative CTC claim will appear (preferably as 
uncontested) in the April 20 filing. (Note: if PG&E does not include the 
claim we have an opportunity to file a proof of claim and ultimately the 
court determines the validity of the claim).
Including Enron on the Creditors' Committee:  PG&E may have the opportunity 
to influence representation on the creditors' committees.  There are several 
reasons to suggest to Glynn that we be included: 1) we are a big creditor, 2) 
we could be helpful in crafting a broader solution, and 3) we are one of the 
real parties in interest behind the PX and ISO (who were listed as 
significant creditors but are really just ""passthroughs"" for the suppliers 
... and PG&E likely would not want to have those political bodies serving on 
the creditors committee anyway)."

"I spoke to the guy reviewing the deals this morning.  He has come up with 
more deals than were on the list provided by Statoil/J. Aron, and now Bob 
Bowen is checking out the list.  They hope to have it to me by the end of the 
day.  It seems to me the way we need to proceed is to contact the J. Aron 
person and get the name of their person who can sign off on the trades, and 
have Bob Bowen and this person come to a consensus about the correct trades.  
Once we've got that nailed, then we amend their form of assignment to add the 
language that the trades need to go under the J. Aron master.  Are you with 
me on this?

You are so cool.  I can't believe that the person in that picture with the 
biggest rock band of all time, was in my bed last night.  Wow!  Everyday I 
found something out that just makes me want you more and more!  Ha Ha Ha

How is Ms. Barbara doing today?  I am weary from the pile of other people's 
projects couched on top of my head but ""I will survive, Hey Hey"".  I've lost 
the edge Maverick,  I am holding on too tight!

"Yes, we have been working with them.  Stephanie and I were asked to meet last 
week with the heads of the California Chamber and the California 
Manufacturer's Association, at which we discussed demand buy down, etc. at 
length.  It was a very positive meeting.  

Stephanie left them with Reliant's Westwide demand exchange program.  And I 
believe that our folks (Jim?) are meeting with Reliant to discuss it further 
in D.C.  

I can fax you a copy of what they're walking around if you don't have it.  
I'll let others chime in, but seems to me that it would be very useful to 
contact him.

Hey guys.  Are we in communication or working with Reliant in California?  In 
particular, a guy by the name of  John Stout or a woman (I think she's PR) 
named Stephanie Newell?  My understanding is that they are shopping a demand 
exchange idea---in particular in Utah.  I would like to contact him in 
preparation for the RGA meeting in Los Angeles, but wanted to check with you 
all first to see what we might already be doing with them.

I double-checked with Bob, and he said Prebon reported these two trades as 
peak. The other two were in fact reported as off-peak - he just entered them 
incorrectly. But as far as this sleeve goes, there's no way one side is peak 
and the other isn't - Prebon has to make up their minds!

Again, let me know what you find out. Until then, we recognize the two trades 
as they are.

Thanks,
Kate

That's what I was confused about because Prebon shows this deal as peak and 
we show it as peak and I know it is the other side of a sleeve.  Can you 
double check with Bob for accuracy.

Does this mean that 598738 should be off peak hours as well? Because 598739 
is only one side of a sleeve deal for EES. I would think that both sides need 
to have the same hours......

Let me know, and I'll change them accordingly.

This should be an exciting season for Houston baseball, and it would be an

ClickAtHome includes the following:

disk drive, mouse, speakers, monitor, modem, CD-ROM drive and Windows 2000=

software. Employees will have the option to receive a subsidized Internet=

however, employees of some Enron companies (Portland General Electric, EOTT=

This information on Ontario nukes is similar to our information. The only 
difference is that our regulatory lawyer feels that only one of the four 
Pickering units (500 mw each) would come back in 2001 (although optimistic) 
followed by one each year after that.  Your report says that all Pickering 
units would come back in 2001.  Even in your report, however, they seem 
doubtful that this is realistic.  The Bruce Units (3000 mw) appear to be dead 
for a long time if not for good.

Regards,  John

P.S.  I'll call you soon on are project, currently on hold until 2001 if we 
decide to build in Ontario.  "

management to try and resolve a number of issues with Enron.  Therefore,
the results of those discussions may cause additional comments from us to
this Letter Agreement..  In addition, my business person is currently out

This is how it will work,

Deal #  Comment
268093  CES Exchange Buy - use when storage injections are less than the 
proxy volume
268090  CES Exchange Sell - use when storage injections are greater than the 
proxy volume
268094  CES Sell - this is the proxy storage injection ticket.  The volume 
should not change.


The daily proxy volume for the month of May is 35,133.  When we inject 
35,133, the transport we use to fill storage will be the supply for deal 
268094.  When we overinject like we did for the 1st - 4th, 35,133 of the 
transport will be matched with deal 268094 and the balance of the transport 
will be matched against deal 268090.  When we underinject, we will use deal 
268093 as the supply for deal 268094.

This may seem a little confusing.  Please call me if you still have questions.

Thanks

Mr. Fastow,

I'm writing all of our participants and confirming plans for the upcoming
corporate finance meetings on May 4-5 here.  As a reminder, you are slated
to sit on the executive option/equity dilution panel on Saturday
morning.  Dave Yermack from NYU, the number one expert on this issue, is
presenting at that session.  (Again, serving as a panelist should require
little preparation on your behalf.)

Also, you and your wife are welcome to attend the dinner on Friday evening,
May 4.  It will be held in the Baker Institute across from the business
school.  Tom Copeland is our speaker - (I think he plans to focus his
remarks on real options).  Vince Kaminski  has told me he will be at the
dinner, however his wife is out of town and will not be.

Please call me direct if I can be of any help or assistance.   I look
forward to seeing you soon.  I've attached a copy of the program along with
a name rooster of those planning to attend.

State fights 6,000 firms' energy deals 
Discount power contracts deemed unfair to consumers 
Bernadette Tansey, Chronicle Staff Writer <mailto:btansey@sfchronicle.com>
Sunday, September 2, 2001 
?2001 San Francisco Chronicle </chronicle/info/copyright> 
URL: <http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/09/02/MN155174.DTL>
Thousands of California businesses may reap cost breaks on electricity while other utility customers live with record rate hikes if the state lets stand a spurt of last-minute contracts with private power suppliers. 
More than 6,000 firms, including big retail chains and industrial plants, signed discounted power contracts in July and August as market prices dropped. 
State officials are incensed, saying the private ""direct access"" contracts with electricity providers could shift the burden for millions of dollars in state power purchases onto households and small businesses. 
State Treasurer Phil Angelides said the same companies that benefited as the state depleted its budget surplus to keep the lights on now want to escape paying their share of the billions spent to ensure power supplies for California. 
""I think it's wrong and it's immoral,"" Angelides said. 
State officials argue that the summer contracts can still be canceled retroactively because California businesses were on notice that their option to shop around for better deals on electricity was about to be suspended by the state Public Utilities Commission. The PUC is set to consider the retroactive ban Thursday. But energy firms say the summer deals were perfectly legal because the PUC had not yet taken action and made a series of draft decisions that put off the effective date of the direct access ban until as late as yesterday. 
""The drafts were not consistent,"" said Tracy Fairchild, a spokeswoman for Alliance for Retail Energy Markets, a consortium of generators and energy suppliers. ""Which one were we supposed to take seriously?"" 
The energy trade group is threatening to sue to protect the summer contracts. Angelides fears that a prolonged court fight could block a $12.5 billion state bond sale to reimburse the treasury for California's emergency power purchases. 
The burgeoning conflict is part of a continuing fight by energy firms and some of their business customers to preserve direct access -- a core provision of the state's 1996 deregulation law. 
Deregulation supporters predicted energy consumers would enjoy lower prices if private generators were allowed to compete with the utilities as power suppliers. But the direct access program was thrown into disarray last year when wholesale electricity prices skyrocketed and the state stepped in to buy power. 
To make sure the state's outlay would be paid back by all ratepayers, the Legislature in January directed the PUC to suspend direct access. By that time, 
most direct access customers were fleeing back to the utilities to benefit from a rate cap that protected them from the soaring market power prices. 
The PUC postponed action on the direct access ban while some legislators were sponsoring bills that would have allowed the program to continue under certain conditions. 
But by July, market prices had come down, and energy providers like Enron Energy Services, AES New Energy and Strategic Energy were again offering direct access contracts. 
Businesses were looking for relief from the record rate hikes imposed on utility customers in June, said Phoenix energy consultant Gina Coleman. Coleman said she helped five retail chains with ""a significant number"" of stores in California negotiate contracts with Strategic Energy this summer. 
""Business is business, and if you can get a better price for something, you should,"" said Coleman, who declined to name her clients. She said the lower costs will help the stores keep doing business in California and hold their prices down. 
Daniel Douglass, an attorney for the Alliance for Retail Energy Markets, said any attempt by the state to cancel contracts retroactively would violate the constitutional law. He said energy firms have purchased power to serve their customers under the contracts and would suffer losses if they were canceled. 
Angelides said the same firms that ran to the state for protection when their market contracts became too expensive now want to take advantage of lower power prices he attributes to the stabilizing effect of the state's long- term power contracts. 
""You can't take advantage of the state's stabilizing the rates, then say, 'Thank you very much,' and stick everyone else with the bill,"" Angelides said. 
State officials have not tallied the total number of customers who signed up in July and August, nor have they estimated the revenue loss that would have to be covered by remaining utility ratepayers. 
Figures compiled by the PUC show that commercial and industrial firms signed more than 6,000 new direct access contracts in July alone. A rough calculation suggests that, as a result, the firms might contribute as much as $64 million less annually to the repayment of state costs. 
The loss might not be significant enough to risk a court fight that would delay the bond sale, state officials said. 
Bu Angelides said the same power firms that helped create the energy crisis by charging exorbitant rates are now threatening a bond issue desperately needed to restore funds needed for education, health care and children's services. 
""What they're talking about doing,"" he said, ""is holding us hostage until they get what they want.""

Subject: Update--Day 1 of California PUC Hearings        

Thanks Roger.  Here are the highlights of today's hearings:

 Common themes--many tracked ours pretty closely
Not a question of whether rates need to rise, but by how much.
Though some oppose any and all rate increases, the lion's share acknowledged 
that the utilities have a cash flow problem and the a rate increase is 
necessary.
Due process matters. 
If the Commission is thinking about going as far as ending rate freezes and 
increasing rates, it better provide for ample due process, or countless law 
suits will ensue.
Don't jump the gun.  
A rate increase is likely, but only the utilities benefit from adoption of 
the utilities' proposals. The Commission needs to carefully scrutinize the 
utilities' claims and take a careful look at the level of increase required 
to maintain access to capital markets.  However, as expected, the utilities 
implored the Commission to jump the gun immediately.  The utilities want the 
Commission to declare an end to the rate freeze and raise rates on Jan.4.
No more divestiture.  
The utility should keep the generating assets it retained, but the Commission 
should ensure that the assets' benefits are allocated equally among all 
customers.  One legislator recommended that the State buy the utilities' 
hydro assets, which would give the utilities the cash they need and give the 
state control over some generation.
Treat all customers equally and fairly.
The Commission should not create two classes of customers (e.g., large v. 
small; direct access v. bundled).  No customer group should be sacrificied to 
save another.
Be as narrow as possible/do as little harm as possible
The immediate problem is the utility's cash/credit crunch.  As such, the 
Commission should do only enough to solve this very specific, immediate 
problem.  A modest rate increase is all that's required and the Commission 
should do no more.

At the beginning and the end of the hearing, the President of the Commission 
asked parties to be prepared (at tomorrow's hearing) to discuss whether the 
Commission could legally use its other, broad powers to raise rates without 
declaring an end to the rate freeze.  It seems that she seems some benefit in 
raising rates, but leaving AB 1890 otherwise intact untill the Commission can 

Marketers and generators are to blame for the problem
Though not universally embraced, the theme came up repeatedly. 

A few parties (e.g., the Unions, low income consumer groups, one PUC 
commissioner) called for complete re-regulation of the industry, returning 
the utilities to vertically integrated monopolies.  But they were the 
exception rather than the rule at today's hearing.

2. Next steps
There hearings were scheduled to end on Thursay, but now will continue 
through Friday.
Tomorrow, lawyers will provide ""oral"" arguments on whether the Commission 
must end the rate freeze in order to increase rates.  We will argue that it 
does not have to, and should not, go through the complex and controversial 
exercise of determing whether the rate freeze is over between now and 
01.04.01.  We will argue that the Commission has the authority to raise rates 
without ending the rate freeze, and if it decides to raise rates, it should 
do so while keeping AB 1890's basic structure in place until a full and fair 
hearing of the issues is completed.   We are talking to other stakeholders to 
persuade them to take the same approach.  In terms of legal arguments, this 
is clearly a long shot, but one that seems worth taking.
After the oral argument, the utilities will present their rate proposals and 
""all interested persons"" will have the opportunity to cross-examine the 
utilities (in short, tomorrow will also be a zoo).
When asked what the process will be for issuing a proposed decision and 
providing comments, the President of the Commission responded ""we don't know, 
it's evolving.""  In other words, the Commission is doing a poor job of 
ensuring that their Jan 4 decision is ""appeal-proof.""
Keep in mind that the situation remains extremely fluid and the trend is 
still toward ending the rate freeze on Jan. 4th.  We continue to aggressively 
offer alternatives to that possibility and continue to try to bring other 
stakeholders to our side.
We're doing everything necessary to preserve our appeal rights.

We can discuss further on the 10 AM (CST) call tomorrow.

Best,
Jeff

Got an update from Jeff Dasovich.  No earth shattering news.  Comments have 
been all over the place.  The impression is being made by differing parties 
that the issues are very complex and would inevitably result in endless 
lawsuits.  Possible conclusion by the CPUC may be to invoke emergency powers 
to implement an emergency surcharge and avoid addressing the issue of when 
the rate freeze ends in these hearings.  However, this is just speculation.  
Jeff will return to the office by 5:00 pm PST and will send out a summary of 
today's hearings.

Carol:

While I am still in the process of going through your mark-up, one item that
could move this along considerably is your consideration of the attached in
lieu of your addition of subpart (x) in your Insert 2.  While it
incorporates the same concept, it is a slightly different approach.

you a copy or are you also getting updates?  Also, I get faxes of all their 
notices.  So far nothing I've received has been interesting.  Do you get 
copies of their notices?  Do you need me to send you anything I feel is worth

They've also promoted me to Compliance Director, so I'm going to go in and 
ask Mark for a raise to match my title!"
"Hi,

I'm back.

I'll give you the short version.  I spoke with John, and he tells me he sent

I want to hear what M. Cash said, and who else you are meeting with.  Maybe I

		 Subject: Enron Center Garage

The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new 
building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being 
offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the 
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The 
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly 
employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to 
the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made 
as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be 
opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street 
level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. 
Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an 
exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to 
Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your 
email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and 
receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new 
garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and 
Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, 
will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

"Mark and Jeff:
Trina and i talked about the issue that you raised with me today.  Our 
preference is to structure the language so that it would only trigger an 
Event of Default under the Swap if the Enron merger caused an Event of 
Default under the Revolver.  At the end of the day, we both felt that this is 
a call that someone on the commercial side should make, such as either Ben 
Glisan or Mike Jakubik.

"Wade, please forward this to the person that pays Statoil.  AND I just faxed 
you a copy of the invoice Kara faxed me.  I believe Heidi Boyd told me that 
ENA was not  making payments to Statoil so CES made the payments.  Let me 
know what you find out.

Please include Scott Goodell on all responses."
"Holly:  I'll try to get something to EWEB today.  Also, we don't prepare 
deemed ISDA's for muni's so I have to create a form.  Sara"

Subject: Power Project in British Columbia

Northland Power (a power plant operator) from Toronto has joined hand with 
Nepco to build a large cogen plant in BC with possible power off-take 
agreement for US Pacific NW (Washington/Oregon). Northland power asked me if 
Enron would be interested to quote indicative prices for this project. Would 
you please advise me with who is responsible for this kind of projects? 
Thanks for your help.

"Thanks.  Lamentably, they don't have a plan.  In fact SoCalGas is saying, ""No 
problems.""

My recollection is that this sheet is a bit vague on detail.

California's gas problems are twofold:

Wellhead prices are still high.  CERA is the best place to get more data on 
drilling activity, etc.

Instate capacity is tigh in PG&E and SDG&E.  CEC did a study, no?  In any 
event California utiilties probably have plans to eliminate the bottlenecks.

Greetings,

Thanks for the TV. and Jaime also said Thanks for the bed room suite.
Chris, I found Dad's old pistol.  It was under the dresser in his bed room.
I placed it in the linen closet third shelf from the top, back left.  It is
captured in a pistol storage case.  I stuck it in behind the sheets and
things.  I saw Chad and Angela on my way out.  They are a great couple.
Jerry, I am going to be very busy with the scrap here at work.  I am going
to get in touch with Gerald and you and him can work out the agreement if he
wants to lease Dad's pasture.
As I stated he will pay $20/acre per year.  You had said we do not want to
pay for a fence along the creek.  When I have leased places in the past I
have had to build new fence at my own expense.  Most folk's base their
cow/calf operations on a five year program/depreciation.  If I built fence
and that particular piece of property sold before the five years was up,
then I was reinversed the balance of my initial fence/material investment,
excluding my labor.  Something to think about.  I hope we do not own that
place for five more years.  Gerald also said he would mow the grass around
the house and sort of keep the place tuned up.

Ma fell Saturday Night and busted her forehead.  They placed her in
Angleton/Danbury for overnight observation.  I think she required about
seven stitches in her head.  There were x-rays taken and her lungs are
pretty much gone.  Of course, that depends on how well the x-ray tech can
read his prints.

Stopped by and saw Bernie Max.  Now where did they come up with a name like
that?  They removed the lymph glands from his neck.  Starting down the torso

by Mary and Carrie will mail me the originals to sign.  I asked about a
termination ont he $1500.00, Joal told Carrie that since we couldn't
include it in this agreement since we didn't agree to it in the meeting
with Mary.  IF Mary agrees, they will prepare and addendum to the original

Vince,
I realise that you don't have time for email or anything these days.   I just wanted to say that I'm very sorry to hear about everything that is going  on at Enron.  I hope that you are OK?  
 
I understand that Enron Europe is pretty much ending  business tomorrow, except for Enron Metals.  It's all very  shocking and unbelievable.  Just to let you know, and maybe it will benefit  someone, we will be looking to hire someone to head some things up for us in  London.  So if you know of anyone who may be jobless over here, feel free  to have them contact me, or send them the attached draft job  description.      
 
Please stay in touch and best of luck to you.
 
Sincerely,
Julie Brennan

"Clem:

Attached to this email you should find a marked version of the Enron Corp. 
guaranty.  A few points:

(1)  Bear claims that the ""cap"" language which we typically include is 
inadequate because the wording implies (under NY law) that if a lesser amount 
is owed at any time, then the cap is reduced to that amount. I've not heard 
of this before.  I believe that they can send the treatise background info if 
you'd like.

(2)  The guaranty covers obligations of ENA in its Bear account and with 
respect to the margin lending agreement.  Bear has added ""performance"" to the 
guaranty as a guarantor obligation.  ENA's account obligations pertain to the 
payment of money (margin); under the margin lending agreement, ENA could have 
to deliver securities sold short in the market pursuant to a loan from Bear.  
Failure to deliver these securities would trigger a default (which is 
essentially reduced to a payment of money).  

(3)  Although Bear removed our Setoff/Counterclaim paragraph, you should 
refer to Par. 5 to see their own version!

Please call me to discuss as ENA is anxious to reduce our margin rates with 
Bear.  The Bear lawyer is leaving town tomorrow afternoon.

reaction to the current draft.  I am still not very happy with the risk

please read it carefully and get me your comments.

guidance toward a successful draft.

Hope you are having a great day and tremendous start to the new year.

"Rhett:
You may recall a few weeks ago I asked you about some language that one of 
our counterparties wanted as an amendment to the term ""Indemnifiable Tax"".  
Another counterparty, Deutsche Bank, has requested the following which I 
think is very similar to what we were looking at before:

Notwithstanding the foregoing, ""IndemnifiableTax"" also means any Tax imposed 
by reasons of a Change in Tax Law by a government or taxing authority of a 
Relevant Jurisdiction of the payer, unless the payee is incorporated, 
organized, managed and controlled or considered to have its seat in such 
jurisdiction, or is acting for purposes of this Agreement through a branch or 
office located in such jurisdiction.

In the ISDA Users' guide, they explain that the effect of this language is to 
eliminate the payee's risk of bearing new taxes imposed by the payer's 
jurisdiction even if the payee's activities in such jurisdiction is the basis 
for such taxes. (except if the circumstances in the definition occur).    It 
thus results in the payer having to gross up for such taxes.

Do you think that we can or should accept this?

Subject: RE: ADA and general issues


Dear Sara:

I learned that the proposed draft was up for signature by members of the
association shortly.  The vicechairman of ADA indicated that he thought that
it was late to make suggestions for this round but Enron's participation
would be welcome for future developments.  He confirmed that the model
agreement is aimed at transactions between residents of Argentina where one
of the parties is a local financial entity, and basically at financial
derivatives.  While commodities are mentioned in the draft they are not
aiming at covering commodities derivaties at this stage.  Note that only
banks were backing the project.  I have to confirm all this with the
secretary of the association who I could not reach last week. My list of ADA
members is slightly outdated but I count on obtaining a new from him when I
reach him.

We could arrange meetings with some of this people when you visit.  Maybe we
could organize an informal lunch at the firm One of my colleagues has been
very much involved in lobbying for derivatives tax legislation.  You could
meet with him when you come.

Other news is that they have resubmitted the draft law on netting to
Congress.


Best regards

"Eldon called me this morning informing me that it's their anniversary this weekend. As such, I sort of tossed any other plans out the window and told him that we'd definitely be around.  As such, I was wondering if you guys planned to do the same, and if so, (following up on your note Scott), it would be totally fucking cool to play golf Sunday morning (particularly since I have not desire to sit around a and watch football).  You guys up for golf?  You plan on doing the anniversary thing?

Dear Vincent,

As I told you on the phone on Friday, I am very interested in a summer
internship at Enron. I would like to point out that I want to pursue a
career in trading, and I am especially interested in derivatives. Given that
Enron is a pioneer in the market making of energy, broadband and weather
derivatives, I find it a company I would be most interested in working for.

I believe that you will find my background of interest to your firm, and I
hope to be interviewed by yourself and other colleagues of yours. I have
final exams from March 19-22, but would be most willing to travel to Houston
for interviews any time from Friday March 23rd onwards. I hope to hear from
you soon.

Greetings.

I write at this time for two reasons.  First, w.r.t. 6/28 - 6/29 London, I
remain uncertain whether you intend personally to attend and present at
that EPRM Financial Math course.  I wanted to advise you know that, in
addition to the sightseeing/theatre we traditionally do at these events, we
-- you, Duane Seppi, Peter Nance and I -- have been invited to dinner at
the home of Klaus and Renee Toft Sat. evening 6/30.

Second, w.r.t. the subsequent mid-July Houston training course, I write to
remind you that at EPRM 2001 we discussed the possibility of jointly
attending a baseball game at Enron Field 7/16 or 7/17.  Per the Astros'
schedule, it turns out the Cleveland Indians will be in town both nights
for a 7:05 p.m. first-pitch start time at the Field.  Let me know if either
7/16 or 7/17 works out from your perspective.

Hope all is well.  Best,
Ehud

"Just as we got the assignment of the natgas trades in, I got a call from 
Anita Herrera, the attorney for Statoil, saying she is sending me an 
assignment of the crude trades tomorrow.  It won't be as painful a process, 
since she told me we they only have one or two crude trades left on the 
books.  Anyway, I wanted to give you a head's up (and maybe to keep any 
collateral you might have to cover the crude trades!)..."
"Karen,

It appears to me that this version of the document allocates a new risk to 
Enron:  risk of damage to a certain road during construction.  It would seem 
that the responsibility to repair it should be limited to damage done as a 
result of the construction.  Also, it is unclear as written as to whether we 
can repair it ourselves, or whether the City fixes it and sends us the bill.  
What is the intent?

"Dave,
 I will be glad to generate the form of Transaction Agreement; however, I 
have a number of questions.
1.  Relationship of Delivery Point and the use of Interruptible Transport on 
Northwest Pipeline.  Is the transport upstream or downstream of the delivery 
point?  If downstream, why isn't it being contracted for by EWEB.  
2.  What volume is being sold each day.  You use the term DCQ and you also 
talk about a 20% tolerance above or below the estimated quantity.  Normally 
their would be no tolerance with a DCQ transaction.  
3.  Is this envisioned to be a requirements transaction.  Is the price the 
same for volumes in excess of the estimated quantity up to an additional 
20%.  Is no penalty to apply if the actual volumes are 0% to 20% less than 
the estimated quantity?  What if they take more than 20% in excess without 
making any arrangements for incremental gas.  What price is to be used for 
such non scheduled excess volumes? 
 Please call me regarding the foregoing so that I can start to work on the 
transaction agreement.

""help"" FERC find the guilty.  

What do people thin about beginning to quietly discuss with members of the 
California state house that the damages of the summer are not (or don't need 
to) being charged to end use customers.  The utilities are doing a really 
good job of wrapping themselves with little households.  In fact, TURN signed 
on to this pleading.

While San Diego customers are harmed, other consumers in California are just 
fine.  Utility shareholders are taking it on the chin.  We need to make sure 
that policymakers (especially FERC) recognize that in making any kind of 
refund the real choice is between Power Marketer shareholders and Utility 
shareholders.

Daddy-o:

If you want I can recommend some hotels we stay in. If you're traveling with 
Dan and Gayle you probably won't be searching out the cheap, flea-bag, opium 
stalls that I frequent. Shanghai has oodles of hotels. If you browse through 
a China ""Lonely Planet"" travel book you'll see a breakdown of the various 
hotels based on prices and accommodations. If you're pinching pennies we can 
get you decent rooms at a new hotel for about 400 yuan ($50 USD), but the 
joint is no where near the Bund (waterfront). Shanghai ain't cheap.

Ai Ping will most likely be in Qingdao doing wedding preparations when you 
arrive in Shanghai. I don't know exactly what my work schedule will be like, 
but I'll be there to meet you. In regards to the Shanghai>Qingdao flight, 
we'll try and book for everybody. I don't think we'll need your credit card 
info. I'm hoping we can arrange for all of you to just pay in the airport 
when you get there (ie. we'll reserve it).

The itinerary below looks fine. I'd take the morning flight to Qingdao on 
June 8th. That way you can get settled in your rooms, hit the beaches, stroll 
the streets, drink fresh Qingdao beer, and familiarize yourselves with the 
city. June 9th is the big day.

June 10th you can hang out for another day in this coastal city, or move 
north to Beijing. I'd say spend the extra day in Qingdao and relax a little 
bit before entering the tourist madness that is Beijing in June. You'll need 
a day to rest after the wedding because you'll be expected to consume about 
three vats of rice liquor at the wedding banquet eating extravaganza. I shit 
you not- this will get ugly. You'll be expected to go native and vomit on 
your wife. I'm fuggin serious! Every fat-assed, 60-something, sausage-eating, 
big-nosed, camera-toting Western devil ever born in the history of the planet 
will accompany you on your trip through the Forbidden City in Beijing. Bring 
lots of benevolence and Buddha-like patience or bring lots of heavy weaponry.

The only pre-wedding activities will be a group dinner somewhere and a night 
at my French buddy's pub on June 8th. We'll probably eat at a shithole 
reataurant downtown that serves the wickedest squid bbq in the Eastern 
hemisphere. You won't be expected to assist in any way other than making 
yourself extremely groovy. We could also arrange a group boat ride on the 
ocean to a couple surrounding islands. Qingdao itself translates into ""Green 
Island."" But, as you know, it's not an island, it's just surrounded by 
several.

Yep, I'm now nearing freak out mode. In a way I've just got to do what I do 
best: be a stupid foreigner and stay out of the Shang family's way. It's Ai 
Ping's wedding in Ai Ping's motherland- I'm just here to be me and play the 
role of the goofy Western monkey who marries the Chinese princess. Please 
god, mail me some dope.

Write again soon. Looking forward to the chaos....

Hugs and booty-smooches all around,

Jon

Subject: FW: A Little Humor to Start Your Day



Computer Gender

An English teacher was explaining to the students
the
concept of gender
association in the English language; noting how
hurricanes at one time were
given only female names, and how ships and planes
were
usually referred to
as ""she."" One of the students raised her hand and
asked,
""What gender is a
computer?""

The teacher wasn't certain and divided the class
into two
groups:  males
in one, females in the other, and asked them to
decide if
a computer should
be masculine or feminine. Both groups were asked
to give
four reasons for
their recommendations.

    The group of women concluded that computers
should be
referred to as
masculine because:

1. In order to get their attention, you have to
turn them
on.

2. They have a lot of data but are still clueless.

3. They are supposed to help you solve your
problems, but
half the time,
they ARE the problem.

4. As soon as you commit to one, you realize that,
if you
had waited a
little longer, you could have had a better model.

    The men, on the other hand, decided that
computers
should definitely be
referred to as feminine because:

1. No one but their creator understands their
internal
logic.

2. The native language they use to communicate
with other
computers is
incomprehensible to everyone else.

3.  Even your smallest mistakes are stored in
long-term
memory for later
retrieval.

4. As soon as you make a commitment to one, you
find
yourself spending half
your paycheck on accessories for it.

Hertzberg (speaker of the CA Assembly) called a meeting yesterday afternoon of the group of market participants that have been negotiating the ""core/noncore"" proposal in California.  The purpose of the meeting was to brief us on their activities and their gameplan for trying to find a solution for California.  Here's a summary of the meeting.  Please keep confidential.

Work will be done over the weekend to put the core/noncore proposal in legislative language.  (We will be in the room.)
Work done by the ""Plan B"" group in the Assembly (Joe Dutra and Joe Nation) will also be put into legislative language over the weekend.
Because no proposal is ""comprehensive,"" a complete legislative package will be created from the various pieces that have been worked on thus far (i.e., core/noncore, ""Plan B,"" Edison MOU)
In addition, there are Republican demands that Hertzberg will need to address (e.g., end the litigation) in order to achieve bi-partison support, which is what Hertzberg's shooting for. 
To move the legislation, the plan is to establish a ""conference committee,"" comprised of an equal number of Democrats and Republicans.
The committe would begin work on Monday and would attempt to finish putting a comprehensive bill together, vote it out of the Legislature and send it to the Governor for signing by Monday, July 16th.
July 16th is the deadline because that is the date that the PUC will issue its proposed decision regarding, among other things, how DWR's revenue requirement will be put into rates, whether Direct Access needs to be suspended, etc.
The PUC is issuing the draft on the 16th in order to give everyone 30 days to review and comment before the Commission votes on a final order on August 15th.  (The PUC will actually issue a ""thought piece"" on Monday the 9th and will use reactions to the ""thought piece"" to craft the develop the proposed decision it plans to issue on the 16th.)
All of this is still up in the air, however.  As of right now, the leader of the Senate (Burton) has not agreed to Hertzberg's gameplan and the Republicans, while interested, have not yet committed to join the process.

Okay, brief resume of my life to date if you like:

Born, grew up, (in England), am currently studying at Nottingham University
(E. Midlands of England) although that's not strictly true as I'm here in
Texas studying at UT Law School as part of an exchange scheme. I go back in
June or whenever and finish my degree so will finally graduate in June 2002.
(Fingers crossed). Other than that I don't do much else but eat, drink and
be merry. Actually I play the viola (and sing a bit) and that took over my
life back home but here I'm doing more of the drinking part of things - more
wine than beer though it has to be said - also better for you - well,
almost!
So there you go - does that bring back any memories?!
Hope you're having a fun week, happy halloween for yesterday - though I'm
not sure how fanatical people are about it in Houston - they certainly seem
to go all out for making a big deal of it here!
Sophie.

Molly,

Please, make arrangements for the interview with this candidate for
a  trading position. Interviews with John Lavorato, Jeff Shankman,
Gary Hickerson, Stinson Gibner.

I talked to him in New York and he is considering
other opportunities, so we have to act fast.
I think John will like him more than Punit.



Thanks

FYI,

I thought some of you might be interested in this half day seminar at UT.  Bill Hogan, as well as speakers from the ISO and PUC are scheduled to speak.  I plan to attend.  If we have more than 3, we can register as a group for $145/person - if more than 10 attend, the price is $100/person.  Ross Baldick, one of Martin Lin's and my advisor is the moderator.  It may prove both interesting and contentious will Hogan being there.

Dale, could you please forward to John and me a copy of the EOL U.S. weather 
derivatives GTCs and long descriptions for swaps and options so that they can 
be looked at for Japan?

By way of background, the traders in Japan (Jonathan Whitehead, Morten-Erik 
Pettersen) want to start offering EOL weather derivatives (swaps and options) 
through Enron Japan Corp. in lieu of Enron Australia as the Enron 
counterparty, beginning the end of August 2000.

As we will need to change the Enron counterparty for Japanese weather to 
Enron Japan Corp. (on EOL), please have the US GTC's forwarded to me, so that 
I can begin the process of amending same to conform to Japanese 
law/practice.   I believe this will be better than attempting to modify the 
Australian GTC's.

Gentlemen,

I woke up early as usual and wanted to help you, but the management had 
other plans.....

In the emotion of the moment last Friday, I was too choked up to say much, 
so let me try to make some amends this morning.  Of course, I hope to get 
together with you guys some day soon, but until then I'd like to say a 
couple of things.

The Weather Team was one of the best, most competent groups within Enron.  
It compared nationally with ""major-league"" meteorology, both public and 
private.  To break this team up is a serious offense to science.  I was 
proud to be a part of it, learning and growing personally and 
professionally.

I don't see how any job I find from here on out will compare to it.  The 
Research Group in general was the finest collection of minds and talent I've 
ever seen.  Vince chose them very carefully.  I just sort of wormed my way 
in, but I was practicing hard while sitting on the bench waiting for my 
chance to prove something.

And, perhaps more importantly, I have gained new friends. If there's 
anything you guys need, let me know.

Mike, as the rest of you know, has an amazing talent for bringing out the 
best in people.  As he told me Friday, I have indeed grown in the past two 
years.  The credit for much of it goes to Mike, who lives the philosophy 
that we called Enron.  Pity that some of the executives didn't.

I could ramble on for a while about this, but I won't bore you with it.  I 
just wanted to say that y'all are the best!  I'd appreciate an occasional 
e-mail if you hear some interesting company news.  Of course, I want to 
immediately know what happens to each of you.

Kevin, you need to get that home e-mail going buddy!

I'll keep you posted on my job hunt if I turn up anything.

You'll hear from me again! :-)

Sam

Brant, Tom

Enserco Energy busted on line today.  Although we are collateralized with 
L/C's, our exposure is increasing due to the size of the on line volume they 
have been doing.  ENA sent an ISDA draft to them a few weeks ago, with no 
response.  Today I spoke to their Credit Manager, Don Perkins, and informed 
him that we can not take on additional volume unless we have an executed 
ISDA. He is going to review, with his legal, the contract and will get back 
to me.  At this point I feel we should not take on any further transactions 
until the ISDA is signed.  Please let me know your thoughts.

Russell

Please forward this e-mail on to the appropriate EOL people so they are aware 
of Enserco's status.

2. Key Barriers to Distributed Generation

Excessive and Unnecessary Utility Stand-by Charges

Solution: The executive orders issued by the Governor on February 14th took=
 a=20
step in the right direction.  Utility stand-by charges have always been=20
designed by the utilities to protect their monopoly position, extract=20
monopoly prices from customers, or both.  But there is no reason to limit t=
he=20
elimination of these charges to generation facilities that are less than=20
1MW.  These limits will only lengthen unnecessarily the time it takes for=
=20
California to close the significant gap between supply and demand and reduc=
e=20
the risk of black outs this summer.  We would propose lifting the cap by=20
offering amendments to SB27X, which is designed to facilitate development o=
f=20
distributed generation.
=20
Excessive delays and costs related to interconnecting facilities with=20
investor-owned and municipal utilities

Solution:   The Governor=01,s executive order regarding interconnection is =
a=20
step in the right direction=01*D-D-26-01 requires utilities to complete=20
interconnection studies within 7 days.  California should ensure that this=
=20
requirement applies to all generation facilities, including distributed=20
generation.  In addition, the financial conflicts the utilities face when=
=20
interconnecting generation facilities are simply too powerful to overcome=
=20
through executive orders or other regulations.  To the greatest extent=20
possible, California should shift control over interconnection away from th=
e=20
utility and place that control with the California ISO.  This could be=20
accomplished through amendments to SB 27X.

Permitting and Air Quality Issues
Developers of distributed (i.e., =01&on-site=018) generation that is 50 MWs=
 or=20
greater must receive certification from the California Energy Commission an=
d=20
therefore face all of the impediments to development that large-scale=20
generation faces. =20

Solution: California should ensure that the executive orders (D-22-01 thru=
=20
D-26-01) issued by the Governor to expedite plant siting and maximize plant=
=20
output apply equally to smaller scale, =01&distributed generation=018 facil=
ities.=20
In addition, distributed generation that is less than 50 MWs continues to=
=20
face local opposition.  The State should ensure that local, parochial=20
interests cannot block otherwise beneficial distributed generation projects=
. =20
These objectives could be accomplished through amendments to SB27X.

3. Credit Concerns Regarding Authority Granted to DWR in AB1X to Purchase=
=20
Electricity on Behalf of the Utilities=20

Enron responded to the RFP issued by DWR to enter into power contracts with=
=20
suppliers.
Enron is in active discussions with DWR to establish contract terms with th=
e=20
goal of entering into a power purchase agreement as soon as possible.
However, ambiguities contained in AB1X have created significant credit risk=
=20
concerns that need to be resolved in order to finalize contract terms.
We understand that the lion=01,s share of counterparties share Enron=01,s c=
redit=20
risk concerns.
Enron has proposed several options for resolving the credit risk issues and=
=20
is working with DWR to arrive at a solution that is mutually agreeable to=
=20
both sides and that might serve as a template for power purchase agreements=
=20
going forward.

Summary of the Source of the Credit Risk Issue

Ambiguous Ratemaking Authority
The language in AB1X is ambiguous as to whether DWR has any authority to=20
charge California ratepayers for the costs of purchasing power.  From our=
=20
analysis of the bill, the language in AB1X appears to leave intact the=20
California PUC=01,s exclusive jurisdiction over ratemaking in California.  =
As=20
such, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree to include in rat=
es=20
adequate charges to cover DWR=01,s costs of power purchases.

Ambiguous Regulatory Authority Regarding Contract =01&Prudence=018
The language in AB1X leaves open the possibility that the California Public=
=20
Utilities Commission could determine that power purchases made by DWR are=
=20
=01&imprudent.=018  On the basis of such a finding, the CPUC could then ref=
use to=20
allow DWR to collect from ratepayers the costs associated with its power=20
purchases.  Consequently, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agr=
ee=20
to include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that=
=20
DWR has entered into with suppliers.
=20
Ambiguous Language Regarding the Ratemaking Mechanism that Will Be Used to=
=20
Recover DWR=01,s Costs of Power Purchases
In addition to the ambiguity regarding ratemaking and regulatory authority=
=20
noted above, the language in the bill is equally ambiguous with respect to=
=20
the specific ratemaking =01&mechanics=018 that AB1X directs the PUC to empl=
oy to=20
permit DWR to recover its power purchase costs. Based on our analysis, it i=
s=20
extremely difficult to determine how the PUC would design the rates to ensu=
re=20
DWR recovers its power purchase costs.  Moreover, as currently drafted, it =
is=20
difficult to determine whether AB1X would even permit the PUC to include in=
=20
rates all of the charges necessary to fully recover DWR=01,s power purchase=
=20
costs.  Again, this ambiguity raises significant credit risk concerns since=
=20
suppliers have little assurance that DWR will have the ability to recover=
=20
from ratepayers the costs of purchasing power.

Options to Resolve Concerns Regarding Credit Risk=20

We have been working diligently with DWR officials to resolve the credit ri=
sk=20
issues.  We have identified three options:

Amend AB1X
The amendments, which are attached to this email, would clarify that a) the=
=20

preferred option, though we understand that the there may be some political=

challenges standing in the way of amending AB1X.  (See attached file=20
entitled, =01&AmendAB1X.doc=018.)

copies of the talking points related to the order that the California PUC=

indicated to us that DWR prefers to pursue the second options. That is, DWR=

prefers to clarify the ambiguities in AB1X through a PUC order and through=

contract amendments.

4. California=01,s Supply-demand Picture Heading into Summer 2001

Both the California Energy Commission and Cambridge Energy Research=20
Associates (CERA), a private sector energy think tank, have issued reports=
=20
showing that California faces a severe supply-demand imbalance.  They diffe=
r=20
only on how much and how soon additional supply will be made available.  Al=
l=20
credible sources agree that supply will be very tight throughout the Summer=
=20
of 2001 and that unless a solution is found immediately, blackouts are=20
likely. =20

CEC and CERA both forecast that California will be short of supply this=20
summer by approximately 5,000 MW.   These numbers are in line with our=20
estimates.  California=01,s supply base currently has a 6% capacity margin,=
 well=20
below the average 15-20%, which is recommended for reliable system operatio=
n=20
in the West.  Since the West relies more heavily upon hydroelectric power=
=20
than other regions, reserves are particularly important, owing to the=20
unpredictability of the weather and the dry year the West has experienced t=
o=20
date. In the event of a low rain and snow period, the system must possess t=
he=20
flexibility to respond to the reduced availability of power supply. =20
California=01,s very low reserve margin makes it especially susceptible to =
this=20
requirement. =20

Other reasons for reduced supply for the Summer of 2001 include the early=
=20
draw-down of reservoirs in the continual effort to manage California's seve=
re=20
supply-demand gap; emissions restrictions on existing plants; and a reduced=
=20
number of customers who can be curtailed under their contracts with the=20
utilities.  Cambridge Energy Research Associates asserts that at the curren=
t=20
pace of siting, permitting and construction, adequate supplies will not be=
=20
added to correct the market imbalance until 2003 at the earliest.

CERA predicts that California is likely to face approximately 20 hours of=
=20
rolling black outs this summer.  The CEC paints a considerably more=20
optimistic scenario, betting that California will bring an additional 5,000=
=20
MWs on line to meet peaking summer demand.  It is our view that California=
=20
should view the CEC's ""rosy scenario"" with considerable skepticism.

5. Suggested Package of Legislative Proposals Designed to Solve California=
=01,s=20
Electricity Crisis

This email offers an overview of our proposed legislative solution.  We wil=
l=20
deliver to your office tomorrow specific legislative language and existing=
=20
bills that we believe can accommodate our proposals.

As we have suggested throughout the crisis, any solution to California's=20
crisis must focus on four issues:

Increase supply
Decrease demand
Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market
Return California=01,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency

Increase supply--Legislative vehicle: SB28X (Sher)
To site and construct a power plant in Texas takes approximately 2 years. =
=20
Enron and others have completed the entire process in other states in less=
=20
than a year.  In California, it takes about six years, or longer.

The Governor=01,s executive orders and Senator Sher=01,s siting reform legi=
slation=20
are steps in the right direction.  Our suggested amendments can improve tho=
se=20
efforts by further addressing the difficulties that project developers face=
=20
in securing air emission reduction credits to meet the air permit=20
requirements included in the CEC's certification requirements.  Enron=01,s=
=20
proposal seeks to streamline the process for 1) obtaining credits and 2)=20
transfering credits between air districts.  In addition, it creates an=20
innovative emissions reduction bank to allow project sponsors to fund=20
emissions in advance of obtaining certification, and permits the affected a=
ir=20
districts to use those funds to finance projects that will produce the=20
required reductions in pollution emissions.

Decrease demand=01*Legislative Vehicle:   AB31X (Wright)
Because of the delay in getting a solution in place in California, closing=
=20
the supply-demand gap through energy conservation and efficiency offers the=
=20
best chance of avoiding blackouts this summer.  This can be accomplished mo=
st=20
effectively and quickly in two ways:

Buy-down demand
California is tapping into an enormous amount of money from the General Fun=
d=20
to finance DWR=01,s power purchases.  California could likely reduce demand=
 more=20
economically by running an auction to determine the payments businesses wou=
ld=20
be willing to receive to reduce their demand for a sustained period (e.g.,=
=20
through the summer months).  DWR could easily run an on-line auction to=20
determine the price it could pay for these demand reductions.  To=20
participate, businesses would be required to have the metering equipment=20
necessary to monitor and verify that they are actually achieving the=20
reductions.  Enron has developed an on-line auction software package, =01&D=
eal=20
Bench,=018 that it would be willing to contribute to the effort.

Use Price Signals to Incent Voluntary Curtailment
To be successful, customers need access to the following key elements:

An internet based hour-ahead price posting system to track the market price=
=20
for hour-ahead power in real time.=20
Real-time metering systems for baseline demand and voluntarily curtailment=
=20
verification.
Settlement process that allows for market clearing prices of energy to be=
=20
paid for load reduction (=01&Negawatts=018).

The potential benefits of an effective demand response program would includ=
e:

=01&creation=018 of additional summer peaking capacity in California, parti=
cularly=20
in the short term, without requiring construction of additional generation=
=20
resources.
reduction of  peak or super-peak load on the over-stressed California=20
electric system, thus potentially reducing the overall cost of electricity =
in=20
the state.
fostering of demand elasticity without subjecting customers to the full ris=
k=20
of hourly market price volatility by passing market price signals to=20
customers and allowing them to voluntarily shed load and be compensated for=
=20
responding.=20

We estimate that we could generate a summer 2001 on-peak demand response in=
=20
excess of 400 MW during certain high cost hours, and a demand response for=
=20
summer 2002 on-peak hours that could exceed 1000 MW.  We further estimate=
=20
that the market response to this program from all ESPs could be 2 to 3 time=
s=20
that amount.  We recommend that the State of California provide rebates=20
directly to customers to fund the installation of advanced metering and=20
control systems that would support load curtailment implementation.

Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market=01*Legislative vehi=
cle:=20
SB27X
The only customers who were protected from price volatility in San Diego we=
re=20
customers who chose Direct Access and signed fixed price deals with energy=
=20
service providers.  Ironically, AB1X takes that important option away from=
=20
customers and businesses.  It is critical that AB1X be amended to remove th=
e=20
prohibition against Direct Access.

Enron's legislative proposal would give customers freedom to enter into a=
=20
direct access transaction, while simultaneously addressing the Department o=
f=20
Water Resources' concerns about stranded power costs that might result from=
=20
customer migration. =20

In addition, California will only achieve a competitive retail market when=
=20
the utility is removed completely from the procurement function.  Procureme=
nt=20
is not a utility core competency, as evidenced by the dire financial=20
condition in which the utilities now find themselves.  California should=20
therefore begin immediately to phase the utility out of the procurement=20
function entirely, with the goal of having all customers served by a=20
non-utility provider within 36 months.  To execute the transition, Californ=
ia=20
should hold a series of competitive solicitations over the 36-month period =
in=20
which competing service providers would bid for the right to serve segments=
=20
of utility load.

Return California=01,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency=01*Legislative =
vehicle:=20
AB18X
Utility bankruptcy will not increase supply and it will not decrease demand=
. =20
In short, bankruptcy does nothing to solve California=01,s supply-demand=20
imbalance.  In addition, bankruptcy increases the likelihood that consumers=
=20
and businesses will bear the significant financial risks of having Californ=
ia=20
State government assume the role of =01&electricity buyer=018 for an extend=
ed=20
period of time.  Finally, bankruptcy will undermine both investor confidenc=
e=20
in California's energy markets and the private sector's willingness to=20
participate in that market.

California can return the utilities to financial solvency by implementing a=
=20
series of staged rate increases.  California should design those rate=20
increases with the dual goal of returning the utilities to solvency without=

One system-simple solution would be:

1) Trade with the Manager Online
2) Manager calls Enron trader and completes a set of trades OTC, which have 
the effect of reversing the original trade and then reallocating among the 
subentities.

This would not involve any system changes or any legal approvals.

Subject: Re: One Password - multiple legal entities for Hedge Funds  

Given a trade on EnronOnline is a contractual agreement between the legal 
entity (established by the USERID) and Enron, we will essentially need to 
assign the trade from that legal entity to the allocated group of entities.  
My understanding is that we will need to have an agreement which allows us to 
assign the trades.  Given this is a legal question, either Carol St Clair or 
Mark Taylor will need to address this.  

Dave can you want to discuss with Per and legal?


To: Bob Shults/HOU/ECT@ECT
cc: David Forster/HOU/ECT@ECT 
Subject: Re: One Password - multiple legal entities for Hedge Funds  

Do we need the agreement or does the client need to show us that they have 
the authority to do the allocation? It seems to me that the fund manager has 
authorization in place to manage each fund and transact as he sees fit. We're 
acting on this authority when they trade over the phone without a power of 
attorney type agreement covering us. In other words, I would expect that the 
documentation we need to have is in the funds hands already and we need only 
review it to confirm thay have authorization to allocate trades.

The only time I know this does not apply is when the Hedge Fund needs to do a 
reallocation to rebalance the funds they manage. We went through this with 
Tiger in January. They need to have us execute trades with each fund to 
rebalance the positions. This is caused by fund flows into/out of the 
individual accounts at specific times of the year. It means we buy from one 
fund and sell to another, leaving our net trading position unchanged, but 
adjusting our individual position with each fund.  The fund manager can not 
do the trades himself directly between the accounts he manages, but he can 
transact with Enron for each fund and achieve the same efffect. Does this 
make sense.

Perhaps we should schedule a time to discuss this further. Today is not good 
for me, but any time next week.

Thanks.

Sep. 10th is indeed feasible.

I scheduled the invitation dates of 9/24 - 10/17 to give me time to make
progress in my class presentations so that students would have more of a
background in listening to Vince's presentation.  If select the 9/10 date,
I would ask Vince to take into account in the level of his presentation
that by that date the students will only have had 6 hrs. of the Foundations
of Energy Finance class (classes begin 8/29 and Labor Day intervenes).  On
the plus side, the students do come in with three finance courses (core
course, investments, advanced corporate) as prerequisites to my class.

In sum, I appreciate the importance of recruiting and can accommodate
Vince's presentation Sep. 10th.  Please advise if Vince would like the 2
1/2 hr. (2 to 5 p.m., including breaks) time slot, or the 75-min. subset
thereof.

I had planned on hosting Vince for lunch with my faculty colleagues.  If
his presence is called for at a lunch scheduled by your Associate/Analyst
Program, we will plan his schedule around that.  By this e-mail I also
inquire of Lexi whether Enron intends to host a reception at the 5 p.m. end
of the class:  If so, she should contact Energy Finance Center Assist.

Subject:        SBX2 78 - Update 

The Assembly Energy, Costs and Availability Committee heard and voted on 
amendments to SBX2 78 proposed by many interested parties.  Some passed, 
some failed and most of them served to further confuse the committee 
members.  Eventually the committee stalled on detailed proposals made by 
TURN and other consumer groups. 

During the hearing Hedy had the opportunity to speak to Nancy McFadden and 
Richard Katz from the Governor's office regarding a couple of issues 
highlighted by Jeff and Mike Day.  Richard said he is willing to make more 
technical amendments when the bill gets to Appropriations.  Subsequently, 
Hedy and I spoke to D.J. Smith at Jeff's request.  D.J. agreed that the bill 
needs to use the August 24th date as a grandfather date for executed DA 
contracts, but specifically asked that we (Enron) not speak to Richard about 
it.  He said he will have the business entities request it as a clarifying 
amendment.  If we request it, he thought Richard would be less likely to 
believe it's clarifying since he believes our motives to be too 
self-serving.  Also, we spent some time with Lenny Goldberg on direct 
access.  We suggested that ""shall"" be changed to ""may"" in order to give more 
leeway to the PUC on direct access suspension.  He didn't necessarily oppose 
the policy, but his position is not to amend a bad bill unless you can 
totally rewrite it (which he later attempted to do). 

A lobbyist for a significant generator told us that they are prepared to 
push Edison into bankruptcy (along with the Canadian government) if this 
bill passes. 

There is no consensus that this measure will ever get to the Governor's 
desk. 

The committee will meet again tomorrow at approximately 1:30 p.m. to vote on 
additional amendments and ultimately to vote on the complete bill. "
"I believe that this was authored by James Carville:


NEW YORK (AP) --The New York Mets announced today that they are going to
court to get an additional inning added to the end of Game 5 of the World
Series. The batting, pitching, and bench coaches for the Mets held a press
conference earlier today.  They were joined by members of the Major League
Players Union. ""We meant to hit those pitches from the Yankee pitchers,""
said the Mets batting coach.  ""We were confused by the irregularities of the
pitches we received and believe we have been denied our right to hit.""

One claim specifically noted that a small percentage of the Mets batters had
intended to swing at fast balls, but actually swung at curve balls. It was
clear that these batters never intended to swing at curve balls, though a
much higher percentage were not confused by the pitches. Reporters at the
press conference pointed out that the Mets had extensively reviewed film of
the Yankees pitchers prior to the World Series and had in fact faced the
Yankees in inter-league play earlier in the year. ""The fact remains that
some of the pitches confused us and denied us of our right to hit,"" said the 
Mets
batting coach. ""The World Series is not over yet and the Yankees are
celebrating prematurely.""Major League Baseball has reviewed the telecast of
all the World Series games and recounted the balls and strikes called by the
umpires of each game. ""While some of the strikes called against the Mets
were, in fact, balls, there were not enough of them to change the outcome of
the World Series,"" the commissioner said. Another portion of the Mets legal
claim stated that, based on on-base percentage, the Mets had actually won
the World Series, regardless of the final scores of the games.

""It's clear that we were slightly on-base more often than the Yankees,"" said

a Mets spokesman.  ""The World Series crown is rightly ours.""The manager of
the Mets has remained in relative seclusion, engaging in some light jogging
for exercise.  He has stated that he believes ""we need to let the process
run its course without a rush to judgment.""

COLLOQUIUM TITLE
My Manhattan Project: A Physicist's
Adventures on Wall St
Nigel Goldenfeld
Department of Physics
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
1110 West Green St
Urbana
IL 61801
http://guava.physics.uiuc.edu/~nigel

Abstract
Why is Wall St. one of the biggest
employers of physicists? What is the
quickest way to lose a billion dollars? How
might academic physicists gain
experience of real world applications? And
why bother? I discuss these and
other questions in light of my own
experience, starting a software company
to market ultra-fast tools for risk
management of derivative securities.







Guys:
         Professor Nigel Goldenfeld of the University of Illinois, [who
also runs an options pricing software firm, NumenX, with Professor Mitchell
Feigenbaum of Rockefeller University] will be visiting the University of
Houston Physics department Monday and Tuesday September 24-25.  Goldenfeld
arrives on Monday afternoon, and we were wondering if there would be any
interest in anyone there going out to dinner with us on Monday evening
(Sept. 24).  His Colloquium will be given at 3:00-4:00 PM (rather than the
normal 4:00-5:00 PM) on Tuesday afternoon in room 634 SR1 on our campus,
but at present it is on Soft Condensed Matter Physics, and I don't know if
he will say anything about his work in ""Econophysics.""  He has also been a
pivotal person in starting an ""Econophysics"" program at Illinois.  You can
either let me know or get in touch with Mike Gorman, who is coordinating
his visit, at 713 743 3558 (or Gorman@uh.edu).

"Lisa,

I haven't gotten the executed docs back, but I'll send you the electronic 
version if that works for you.

Timing is as follows:

Northwestern gives 30 days notice of readiness to close.  If the closing does 
not occur before July 16, they make another $5m payment.

10 days after notice, they fund the balance into escrow, and we close 20 days 
later.  

If they fail to close on or before Sept 1, they forfeit their previous 
payments, unless we have failed to provide the GE consent to assignment, 
which we are working on now.

I've given this timeline without looking at the doc, so I will let you know 
if I missed something.

Hopes this helps.

PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC COMPANY AND PG&E CORPORATION FILE PLAN OF REORGANI=
ZATION=20
Plan Pays Claims in Full, Does Not Call for Retail Rate Increases or State =
Bailout
(San Francisco, CA)- PG&E Corporation (NYSE: PCG) and its utility unit Paci=
fic Gas and Electric Company jointly filed a Plan of Reorganization in U.S.=
 Bankruptcy Court today that enables Pacific Gas and Electric Company to pa=
y all valid creditor claims in full and emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy p=
roceedings. The official creditors' committee supports the plan.
""This plan is an achievable solution that will enable Pacific Gas and Elect=
ric Company to move out of Chapter 11 as a financially strong business posi=
tioned to continue safe, reliable and responsive delivery of gas and electr=
icity to its customers, pay all valid creditor claims in full, and do so wi=
thout asking for a rate increase or a state bailout,"" said Robert D. Glynn,=
 Jr., Chairman of Pacific Gas and Electric Company and Chairman, CEO and Pr=
esident of PG&E Corporation.  ""And, the plan will enable us to provide long=
-term growth prospects to shareholders."" =20
The plan reorganizes Pacific Gas and Electric Company and PG&E Corporation =
into two separate, stand-alone companies no longer affiliated with one anot=
her. The reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric Company will continue to own =
and operate the existing retail electric and natural gas distribution syste=
m.  The electric generation, electric transmission, and natural gas transmi=
ssion operations currently under Pacific Gas and Electric Company will be p=
art of PG&E Corporation. The common shares of the reorganized Pacific Gas a=
nd Electric will be distributed to PG&E Corporation shareholders.
The electric generation, electric transmission and gas transmission operati=
ons, when reorganized as new businesses under PG&E Corporation, will have t=
he ability to issue debt that will be combined with new financing at Pacifi=
c Gas and Electric and used to help pay creditors' claims. The plan also re=
structures certain existing debt and uses $3.3 billion in cash on hand to s=
atisfy creditor claims.=20
Under the plan, all valid creditor claims will be paid in full, using a com=
bination of cash and long-term notes.  In total, the plan will provide cred=
itors with about $9.1 billion in cash and $4.1 billion in notes. The vast m=
ajority of creditors-those with allowed claims of $100,000 or less-will rec=
eive cash payments for the full amount of their allowed claims on the effec=
tive date of the plan.  Most secured creditors will also receive 100 percen=
t of their allowed claims in cash.  Finally, unsecured creditors with allow=
ed claims in excess of the $100,000 threshold will be paid 60 percent in ca=
sh and 40 percent in notes.
 =09Following the restructuring, Pacific Gas and Electric Company and PG&E =
Corporation will be organized as follows:=20

?=09Pacific Gas and Electric Company will be a separate California corporat=
ion focused on providing electric and natural gas distribution service to i=
ts customers in Northern and Central California.  It will hold 70 percent o=
f the current utility assets (in terms of book value) and will employ 16,00=
0 people.  Pacific Gas and Electric Company will continue to provide the fu=
ll range of utility services to one out of every 20 Americans. =20

?=09PG&E Corporation, in addition to its existing National Energy Group bus=
iness, will have three new businesses that will own and operate the electri=
c generation, electric transmission and gas transmission operations formerl=
y under Pacific Gas and Electric Company.=20

The new electric generation business will be a California company establish=
ed to own and operate the hydroelectric and nuclear generation assets and a=
ssociated lands, and to assume the power contracts with irrigation district=
s, now held by the utility.  In total, the unit will have approximately 7,1=
00 megawatts of generation.  The facilities will be operated in accordance =
with all current FERC and Nuclear Regulatory Commission licenses, and in ke=
eping with sound environmental stewardship policies.  The generating busine=
ss will sell its power back to the reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric Com=
pany under a 12-year contract at a stable, market-based rate.=20
The new electric transmission business will be a California company establi=
shed to own and operate the transmission system currently operated by the u=
tility.  The system comprises 18,500 circuit miles of electric transmission=
 lines and cables.
The new gas transmission business will be a California company established =
to own and operate the natural gas transmission assets currently operated b=
y the utility, including 6,300 miles of transmission pipelines and three ga=
s storage facilities. =20
Following the reorganization, the California Public Utilities Commission wi=
ll continue to regulate the reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric Company, i=
ncluding retail electric and natural gas rates.  The Federal Energy Regulat=
ory Commission (FERC) will continue to have jurisdiction over the licenses =
for the hydroelectric assets, and the rates, terms and conditions of servic=
e provided by the electric transmission business.  FERC will also assume ju=
risdiction over rates for the power generated by the Diablo Canyon Nuclear =
Power Plant, and over the rates, terms and conditions of service for the ga=
s transmission system, which will become an interstate pipeline. =20
Glynn said, ""This plan, without raising retail rates, provides a safe, reli=
able and long-term electric supply to California customers.  It enables our=
 company to maintain a qualified workforce.  And it enables us to keep our =
generating assets intact and integrated, rather than selling them piecemeal=
 to pay creditors.""
The company expects that roles and responsibilities for the vast majority o=
f its workforce will be unaffected by the plan. The reorganized Pacific Gas=
 and Electric Company and the newly established entities will employ essent=
ially the same people who operate the various assets under the current orga=
nization.=20
""We envision essentially the same experienced, dedicated team continuing to=
 do their jobs with a comparable level of pay and benefits programs,"" said =
Glynn.  ""We believe these businesses should be operated and maintained by t=
he people who know how to run them best.""
In addition to resolving creditors' claims and maintaining stability for cu=
stomers and employees, the plan also provides long-term benefits to the sta=
te.  It provides the state with a path to exit the business of buying power=
 for customers, by identifying conditions under which Pacific Gas and Elect=
ric Company would be financially able to re-assume the procurement responsi=
bility that is currently being fulfilled by the state Department of Water R=
esources.
The Chapter 11 process requires that the plan of reorganization ultimately =
be confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court before it can be implemented.=20
Paul Aronzon, legal counsel for the Official Committee of Unsecured Credito=
rs, said ""This plan provides a comprehensive and responsible framework to r=
esolve creditors' claims and restore PG&E's creditworthiness.  It has our f=
ull support, and we look forward to an expeditious resolution of the Chapte=
r 11 process.""=20
""With this plan filed,"" said Glynn, ""we are now focused on bringing the Cha=
pter 11 process to completion, reaffirming the financial health and creditw=
orthiness of our operations through this reorganization, restoring customer=
s' confidence, and rebuilding value for our shareholders.""

can be of any help whatsoever.  Also, whatever flowcharts or schematics you 
can offer would greatly appreciated, as well as a list of services agreements.

Dale Neuner is anxious to resolve the issues surrounding FX transactions on 
EOL.  Have you concluded that we need RMT as the EOL party for internal 
hedging FX products for London and Japan.  Am I correct in the following?

RMT will be the party transacting directly with international Enron 
affiliates (i.e., ECTRIC, through EEFT, and Enron Japan) under new/existing 
services agreements. 
ENA will be the financial party transacting directly with third parties.  
Does ENA also act directly with non-affiliated Japanese customers (if the 
situation should arise?)

Thanks.  Sara

"Craig,
 Attached please find a revised draft of the Ormet Contract.  I have 
incorporated the language from the Credit Worksheet prepared by Jason 
Williams.  That language is included in Sections 4.2 and 4.3 of the Contract 
and in the definitions for Material Adverse Change, Guarantor, Funded Debt, 
Current Ratio, and Net Worth.  
 Regarding Amy Baird's memo, I have made the requested changes in Article 3 
of the Contract regarding changing ""Schedule"" and ""Scheduled"" to ""deliver"" 
and ""delivered"" and ""receive"" and ""received"".  I did not add the language 
requested in (iii) because that language is already included in the 
definition of ""Replacement Price Differential"".  I included the language she 
requested under (iv) as (iii) in Section 3.2  I omitted the last sentence 
relating to consequential damages of $1,000,000 per occurrence as we 
discussed and left in the language in Section 8.3 which limits the 
consequential damages to a maximum of $1,000,000 during the term of the 
Agreement.  Likewise, I did not delete the language from Section 8.3 
providing that the gas is being supplied solely on the express 
representations and warranties provided in the Agreement and that all other 
warranties are being waived.  I did delete the language relating to Texas law 
and sentence starting with ""Therefore, the Parties agree that (i) three"" 
because we had agreed to delete the language from Section 4.1 which set forth 
the method of determining a party's liquidated damages.
I added a sentence at the end of Section 8.5 relating to trial before the 
court with waiver of right to jury trial.  I deleted the language relating to 
arbitration in Appendix 1.  
As we discussed, I did not make the change to force majeure.  We need to 
discuss this.  Our obligation should be limited to having firm transportation 
on one of the pipelines with interruptible transportation on the other.  If 
the firm transportation is interrupted because of force majeure, our 
obligation should be limited to using commercially reasonable efforts to 
cause the volumes to be delivered via the other pipeline if there was 
available capacity on such other pipeline.  
 Please review the contract and if you agree that it represents your 
understanding, you may forward it to the folks at Ormet.  I will be out of 
the office on Monday, but will be available by phone.

CALIFORNIA ENERGY MARKETS

[1] Power Authority Faces Legislative Backlash 
After a three-month honeymoon, the new California Power Authority 
is being shredded in the winds of politics this week with the Legislature 
looking into its deals, the California Energy Commission annoyed with its 
monopolizing ventures and the Department of Water Resources rebuffing 
its plan to sell its power through state contracts. Other than skepticism 
from legislative staff about its microturbine bid plan, the Power Authority 
escaped major problems in its requests for bids for photovoltaics and 
fuel cells at [18]. 
[18] Assembly to Investigate Power Authority 
(from [1]) 
Is the California Power Authority a dangerously 
out-of-control state agency, or is it the best hope for get-ting 
back some state control over electricity supplies? 
The Joint Legislative Audit Committee is looking into the 
Power Authority's role thus far in carrying out the letter 
and spirit of SBx2-6 in a hearing set for November 1. 
The move is spearheaded by the offices of Assem-blymember 
Fred Keeley (D-Boulder Creek), the chair 
of the joint committee, and Assembly speaker Bob 
Hertzberg (D-Van Nuys). Both members were princi-pal 
authors of the Power Authority's enabling legisla-tion, 
SBx2-6. Legislative staff are questioning the 
Energy Foundation's unpaid role in devel-oping 
the Power Authority's requests for bids, particularly 
the RFB for microtur-bines. Only one com-pany, 
Capstone, can meet the requirement written into the RBF by the Energy 
Foundation, and staff are looking into potential overlaps 
between Capstone and the Energy Foundation. 
Political maneuvers are swirling around the Con-sumer 
Power and Conservation Financing Authority. 
Not only elected officials are concerned; the staff and 
heads of other agencies the Power Authority must 
work with are digging in their collective heels to op-pose 
Power Authority overtures. Tom Hannigan, di-rector 
of the Department of Water Resources rebuffed 
Power Authority board chair David Freeman's pro-posal 
to have it buy peaker output. California Energy 
Commission members said they are at policy odds 
with the Power Authority's siting plans. 
In an October 4 letter to Freeman, Hannigan said 
that the Power Authority's power-wind and fossil 
peakers-is likely too expensive, overblown and not 
able to respond quickly enough to balancing power 
needs. ""The letters of intent already approved by the 
Power Authority could far exceed [DWR's] ability to ab-sorb 
that power given the outlook for net-short need."" 
Freeman assumes that the market for Power Authority 
power will be via contract, not the spot market. ""Selling 
on the spot market is difficult to finance and risky,"" said 
Power Authority spokesperson Amber Pasricha. 
The Power Authority is the only agency cur-rently 
in the position of actually being able to acquire 
new energy as the state's $12.5 billion bond issue to 
underwrite continued DWR power purchases is in 
limbo and the California Independent System Operator 
is still not creditworthy. Still, the Power Authority 
cannot issue bonds until it has its own economic 
house in order, and an Assembly investigation might 
jeopardize that [J.A. Savage].

We are not giving any more money in California.  To that end we just sent a letter to the D's saying, essentially, ""we're giving the money we thought we were going to give you to the N.Y.

Subject: Internship



Dr. Kaminski:
?
I just wanted to touch base and see if I needed to snail mail  a copy of my 
resume or get in touch with anyone else over at Enron.?  
?
The finance department at LSU will be sending out financial  award letters to 
new Ph.D. students before long, and my interning at Enron would  free up some 
additional departmental funds.? In addition, If I will be here  in Baton 
Rouge during the fall, I will need to pay my tuition next month.?  I am able 
to pursue an internship in large part because of the department's  
cooperation and assurance that when I return I will still have a research and 
or  teaching assistantship to help fund the completion of Ph.D.? I have been  
told that such cooperation and assurances are rare at LSU, so I am trying to  
rock the boat as little as possible.
?
I realize until I receive an offer from Enron my internship (I  say 
internship rather than sabbatical because LSU will not continue to pay me my  
stipend while I am away) is not assured until an offer has been extended by  
Enron.? I understand that there are procedures?and protocols that must  be 
followed before this occurs, and I would be willing to do whatever is  
necessary to move to the next step in that process.
?
I will be in Houston on July 8 & 9 for my wife's  grandmother's 80th 
birthday.? If it would be convenient, I could be in  town?on the preceding 
Friday, or following Monday for a visit and/or  interview.? If not, given the 
relatively close proximity between Baton  Rouge and Houston, I would be happy 
to come at another time.

Angela:
We have reviewed the Form of Assignment and Amendment Agreement and have
the following comments:

1.   Based on discussions that Russell Diamond has had with Matt Crocker,
in Section (e), the definition of Credit Support Provider in clause (ii)
should eliminate all of the language after the proviso.

2.   I think we need to amend the definition of ""Material Adverse Change""
in the CSA to refer to Party B's Credit Support Provider.

3.   In Section (g), in the second line of (g)(1) the word ""Provided""
should be changed to ""Provider"".

I am still reviewing the form of Guaranty which you sent.  I will have
Susan Bailey send you our form of Guaranty shortly.  I would prefer if we
attach the forms of Guarantys to the Assignment Agreement and refer to the
forms in Section (d).  I look forward to hearing from you.

We urgently need to have a new prime account set up at Bear Stearns to facilitate moving the Anker Coal positions from ECI into a fair value entity.

I had forwarded this to Frank Sayre as both of you were out on Friday.  This is background information on why we need to set up the prime account for ECT Europe Investments Inc.

We have been given until the 12th to move the Anker positions to the ECT Entity.  The account will need to be fully open and funded before the positions can move.

As this is of the highest priority please let me know immediately if there will be any issue with completing paperwork by tomorrow.

Thanks,

Tom

Subject:	Anker
Importance:	High

Dear Tom,

As we discussed, here are the stipulations we talked about regarding the entity to which Enron Credit Inc. can transfer the Anker stock and bonds. Those stipulations regarding the transferee entity are that it:

1. must be a US company (this is for tax reasons)
2. must be a ""fair value"" entity under US GAAP (accounting reasons)
3. must by an entity whose results roll up to Enron Europe Limited (account reporting purposes)
4. must be able to hold stocks and bonds viz. have a brokerage account

Of existing Enron entities, the only entity that meets 1. to 3. is ECT Europe Investments Inc. Therefore, this entity would need a brokerage account. This would appear to be the easiest (!) way in which to meet all four conditions.

As we discussed, even if we gave Bear Stearns a global Enron Corp. guaranty I do not think that ECT Europe Investments Inc. would be able to take advantage of Enron Credit Inc.'s funding arrangements unless it had further 0% risk weighted transactions held in the account.

Thanks and regards,

Edmund"
"Happy New Year!

I was hoping you could respond to some issues raised by Enron's Argentine 
commercial group.  They have told me the following:

(1)  An association known as the ""Argentine Association of Derivatives"" has 
developed a document currently being circulated in the Argentine market for 
use in the near term.  It is in Spanish and it is not an ISDA.  It is a 
""short"" document (i.e., much shorter than a standard ISDA Master Agreement 
and ISDA Credit Support Annex).

(2)  This document is being prepared by experienced professionals.  Are you 
involved in this effort?  Is ISDA involved?

Perhaps we could schedule a conference call and/or you could provide me with 
an accurate account of any local activity in connection with the foregoing.  
If ISDA is not being used in Argentina for commodity swaps and derivatives, 
Enron needs to understand the issues and current discussions about 
derivatives transactions.

I look forward to hearing from you.  Regards.  Sara"

Below is the response that we received from our Agent.  Please call me at
(2120 902-1930 with any questions that you may have.


This has reference to our telecon. Enclosed is the relevant RBI regulation
for the captioned company (ABC) to sell its stake in the local company. To
effect the sale, ABC would require an approval from Reserve Bank of India
(RBI) even though the stock is listed. The documentation required varies
depending on whether the stock is thinly traded or actively traded. RBI's
definition of thinly traded is included in the regulation.

The company is required to fill out Form TS1 (I  am enclosing the format)
and submit this to RBI. In addition, the RBI requires certain documents
which are detailed in the form itself.

Trust this helps. Any other information that you require, please do not
hesitate to get in touch.

"Greetings:
n order to keep everyone in the loop, the folks on today's call wanted to 
send out a brief summary of the call for the benefit of those who couldn't 
make it.  Apologies for any omissions, inaccuracies, etc.  Others who were on 
the call please chime in if I've gotten anything wrong, or missed anything.

Best,
Jeff

SUMMARY
Enron, Duke, El Paso and Williams were on the call, as was Michael Hoffman of 
the Blackstone Group (the Governor's financial advisors).
On the subject of how the group would organize itself, it was agreed that the 
calls would be open to anyone who wanted to participate.
A smaller group consisting of Duke, El Paso, Enron, and Williams would take 
the lead on walking the halls of Sacramento, meeting with policy makers, and 
advocating whatever plan the group develops.
Folks agreed that achieving a comprehesive solution requires a tangible 
process; that is, the principals need to get in a room, face to face, for 
however long it takes to work out a resolution.
It was agreed that the process should start no later than the beginning of 
next week, and that it should take place in Sacramento.
It was decided that the Legislature and the Attorney General needed to be 
brought into the process as soon as possible, i.e., next week.
There was some discussion regarding the release today of ""Plan B.""  Plan B is 
a plan proposed by Democratic and Republican legislators as an alternative to 
the MOU that the Governor struck with Edison.  After that call I received a 
copy of ""Plan B.""  If you'd like a copy please send me your fax number.
Folks on the call agreed to have the next ""supplier-only"" call-in meeting on 
Friday.
Finally, Michael Hoffman said that they are hoping to have a ""ratings agency 
level"" presentation prepared by the end of the week.  The goal of the 
presentation is to reassure capital markets that the bonds the state seeks to 
issue are solidly backed by retail rates.

The Agenda for Tomorrow's Call with the Governor's Staff
Item #1:  The Credit Issue
Michael Hoffman said that the Governor's office wants to start tomorrow's 
meeting discussing the creditworthiness issue.  
Hoffman said that the Governor's folks are hoping to have completed by the 
start of tomorrow's meeting a draft of an agreement between the California 
PUC and CDWR.  The agreement is designed to ensure that DWR gets paid for 
power services delivered.  
If the draft is ready, they'd like to discuss on the call tomorrow.  

Item #2:  Identify the Components of a Comprehensive Solution.
It was agreed that our group should put on the table at tomorrow's meeting 
the universe of issues that need to be included in a comprehensive solution.
Enron was asked to take a first stab at what those components are.  The 
following is a brief outline, which is not intended to be definitive, but a 
starting point for discussion.
Utility creditworthiness
retail rates must reflect costs
Increase supply
streamline and otherwise reform the siting process
Decrease demand
establish real-time pricing
implement demand buy-down and other conservation programs
Create a real market
Remove the State from the power-buying business as soon as possible (e.g., 
once new rates are in place and utilities are returned to creditworthiness; 
approximately 3-6 months)
Return the procurement role to the utilities
Reinstate Direct Access immediately for all customers
Within 18-24 months, create a ""core/noncore"" market structure for 
electricity, similar to California's market structure for natural gas
Keep the industry in the hands of the private sector
Reject proposals calling on the State to take over transmission, generation, 
etc. 
Resolve outstanding legal claims, investigations, etc.
Resolution requires certainty and prompt payment (understanding that 
discounts on receivables is on the table for discussion)"

Subject: recommendation of an outstanding Baylor MBA student for summer  
internship


Dear Stinson,

I would like to call your attention to Rusty Parks, who is an MBA student 
here and has been serving as my research assistant since last fall.? Rusty is 
a very outstanding individual with a very impressive work ethic and interest 
in topics such as financial engineering and technology, particularly as these 
issues pertain to the energy industry.?? In fact, you met Rusty during your 
recent visit to Baylor (specifically, last month over dinner at the Gamma 
Iota Sigma chartering  ceremony).

I happen to know that Rusty is already scheduled to visit Enron for an 
interview for a summer internship on April 19.? He has been invited by Althea 
Gordon.? If there is any possibility that you could meet with him during his 
visit, I am sure that he would be most grateful.?  Rusty is one of the very 
best research assistants I have ever had, and I am sure that Enron would 
benefit from having him aboard during the coming summer. 

Sincerely,

Jim Garven

P.S.: Please find Rusty's resume attached to this email.

*PG&E <PCG.N> SAYS PACIFIC G&E FILED FOR CHAPTER 11 VOLUNTARY
BANKRUPTCY RELIEF


NEW YORK, April 6 (Reuters) - Pacific Gas & Electric Co., which is 
California's largest investor-owned utility and has been struggling with that 
state's power crisis, said on Friday it filed a voluntary petition for 
bankruptcy protection with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern 
District of California. 

Trading was halted in PG&E shares on the New York Stock Exchange before the 
filing. They last traded at $11.36, down 2 cents. 

The Chapter 11 filing was disclosed in mirror filings by the utility and its 
parent, San Francisco-based PG&E Corp. <PCG.N>, with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission. 

The utility said in the filing that it ""retains control of its assets and is 
authorized to operate its business as a debtor in possession while being 
subject to the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court."" 

A 1996 state utility law deregulated wholesale prices but capped retail 
prices. Pacific G&E has said it accumulated more than $8.9 billion of back 
debts because a rate freeze prevents it from passing on its soaring wholesale 
power costs to consumers.

is to organize a 1 or 2 day seminar in S?o Paulo, having Nancy Wodka (B&P)

legal issues of ""Contracting"" (focusing on PPAs and equity participation).  I 
would also very much like to have you talking about ""Derivatives"".  
Additionaly, it would be interesting to have someone from EES (or V&E) to 
talk about ""Outsourcing"".  I'd like to hear your opinions before contacting 
Nancy and Jose Emilio.  Please be advised that Nancy has indicated to us that 
the Seminar must take place in March.

Thanks for your cooperation.

conference call with John, Carolyn and Rick Vincens, and we are pushing 
forward.  If you read this, could you tell me about any critical issues.  
Also, has there been a risk memo started, and has Accounting signed off on

"I am in London this week for a series of meetings and an appeal to the House 
of Lords of the lawsuit that I was over here for in July(we won $130 USD) 
What a dreary place in the winter. I dont have much to report. I have been 
traveling a bunch--- in the last 10 days, I have been to Portland, Calgary, 
LA, St. Louis, and now London. Julie has held her tongue because of her 
impending 8 weeks in Austin this summer. The kids are great. Lots of sibling 
rivalries going

I have been biking with Garribaldi and Worscheh in preparation for our 
participation in the Houston to Austin bike tour. Garribaldi has a new job 
with a couple of big projects in the pipeline. Worscheh finally got his 
financing on his project so he is pretty chipper these days. They are 
pregnant again and out of space in their house. Missy Medary is running for 
District Court Judge in Corpus Christi. She is running as a Republican in a 
Democratic stronghold and her last name is not Perez or Medarcia so her 
chances are slim. She is hoping for a George W. Bush coattail effect. Tom was 
not all that keen on the idea the last time I talked to him. Don't quote me 
on this but I think he is worried that she is a status seeker and that she 
will have way too much of what she wants if she is elected( Judges tend to 
have a lot of people kissing their ass) Rob and Amy are just holding on with 
their 4 kids. I think Rob's job is going well: they made one large aquisition 
at the bottom of the market and commodity prices have doubled. I haven't seen 
anyone else,although I did talk to John Scott the other day. He works for a 
firm in Dallas that does alot of Enron's work. I laughed at him when he told 
me he is trying to get his kids into Country Day. He was always calling it 
Country Gay. Tell Kinga I said hi if you are still...er...dating?"

Do you have plans for Wednesday evening?

I think Dave Weiner and Chanra (sp?) Sherman have talked with my partner Mark
Neubauer (whom they know and whom you met here in December) about a dinner
Wednesday night, and I know that they've been assuming that you and I would be
part of the group as well.  But it occurs to me that maybe no one talked to
you about it.

Caroline:

You should have already seen the two ISDA's (Valentis, CD Holdings) emailed 
yesterday evening per your instructions.  I am still waiting for you to send  
information regarding inhouse/outside legal counsel for both parties.

The Schedule and Paragraph 13 sent to Valentis et al is very much like the 
hedge fund template which legal is refining.  We are reviewing the first 
draft and commenting.

FYI - I will not be in the office on Friday, April 27.  Also, the Enron legal 
conference is next week and the lawyers will be in San Antonio from May 2 
(afternoon) through May 4.  And finally, I will be on vacation during the 
week of May 7 - May 11.  Please try to make plans (conference calls, 
counterparty comments, etc.) accordingly.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks.

Jeff;
In response to your questions, I cannot explain why everyone missed this
bill in the past, I have raised it to the attention of my clients twice in
the last two months.  However, now that it is moving they have got the
message.  Williams (Kern River) is going to host a meeting today to create a
coalition to oppose the bill.  Bev Hansen knows where the meeting will take
place.  In addition to Williams, I understand that Questar, WSPA, and other
retail customer groups will join the coalition and oppose the bill.  My
client Wild Goose will also be listed in opposition, but they don't carry
that much clout or name recognition so far.  I am hopeful that other groups
will surface soon.

As for the bill itself, the problem is two fold.  First, the CPUC decides
what infrastructure to build at the request of the utilities.  They take
input from customers, but Loretta is a command and control type all the way,
and she will try to scare away private capital investment by interstate
pipelines by mandating that the utilities build a gold-plated
state-regulated system.  While the bill does not (and cannot legally) bar
interstate pipelines from coming into the state, it has provisions which
will prevent large customers from signing up with the interstates.  The
large customers have to commit to take firm service on a 5 year basis with
exit fees.  If they don't take this, they can only get interruptible service
from the utilities.  Many if not all large customers, especially generators
cannot afford to take partial service from an interstate and have only
interruptible access to the LDC system.  This is the same dilemma that the
RLS tariff caused.  My belief is that the obligation on the part of the
commission to provide the utilities with cost recovery for the new
investments will be used as justification by the utilities for another
attempt to reinstitute the RLS tariff or an onerous peaking rate.  The
Commission will impose a premium price on service to customers who have not
undertaken the firm 5 year commitment and will therefore be unable to
economically take partial requirements service from an interstate.  My view
is based on Sempra's reaction to the current peaking rate proposed decision
and statements by Lynch's office.  This could interfere with Enron gas sales
over the interstates, and would certainly threaten any Transwestern plans
for building across the border into California, although that does not
appear to be a high priority at this time.  This bill will also make it more
costly to develop gas supply arrangments for new power plants which had
hoped to direct connect to interstate pipeline capacity for a portion of
their needs.

Please call if you have further questions.  Mike Day

I've taken a quick look at the bill and have attached for easy viewing.
Few questions.

Mike,
   I understand from our conversation yesterday that your following this on
   behalf of Questar.  Do we know if the other pipelines have been active
   in any discussions on this bill?
   What about the generators?  Have then been involved, since presumably,
   their in need of lots more capacity (and they're referenced in the
   bill)?
   What about large customers?  They been screaming for more
   infrastructure, too, and many have blamed SoCalGas (and the PUC) for not
   delivering it.
   Do we know if pipelines, generators, large customers are supporting or
   opposing the bill?  I'll try to check around, too, in between the
   electric mayhem.
   There doesn't seem to be anything in the bill that prevents the
   interstates from building into the state.
   If that's true, wouldn't the PUC take those projects into account when
   doing its analysis and only require the utility to construct (and
   noncore to take) capacity that isn't already being met by others (i.e.,
   interstates) bringing pipe into the state?

Any info you can provide on these fronts would be very useful.  Don't want
Enron too far out in front of opposition until we find out a bit more
regarding 1) whose fer and agin it and 2) analysis of what the bill
actually does/does not do.

Thanks again for the heads up.

Best,
Jeff

Subject:  AB 23XX   Bad Bill Alert

Is AB 23XX moving with a chance of passage?   I just learned that this
Pescetti bill that was AB 1425 was revived as a 2X bill.  It is very
anti-competitive, and could hurt a number of TW, EES, or ENA gas deals by
binding customers to 100% utility service through the imposition of large
exit fees by the CPUC.  If there is a chance that it moves, we need to
discuss the effect of this bill.  Mike Day

adjust!)  Or if we don't want to feel rushed, then a drink with Laura sounds 
great.  Ask if her pronunciation in Spanish class is improved or impaired by

We could go to dinner at Joey Tomatoes right after the meeting at 5:00.  Or, 
we could go for a drink with Laura after the meeting and you and I could go 
to dinner afterwards. My preference would be to eat earlier rather than 
later, but I'm pretty flexible.  Let me know which works better for you.

Dear Carol,    We do not want to create an agreement specfic coversheet for
each counterparty.  Is there some way to put language in the body of the
letter agreement to address your concerns.  The procedure we are proposing
is intended to supplement current requirements in the ISDA, not replace
them.  If you feel that additional definition needs to be added to the
confirmation process, shouldn't we put that definition in the letter
agreement rather than on the cover sheet?

Our goal is to be able to expedite our response to counterparty confirms.
In order to do this we need to have the same cover sheet in place for each
counterparty.  Please call me at 678-579-3378 so that we may discuss
possible solutions.  Thanks, Lin

"It didn't occur to me until seeing Richard's message that we might have a 
hole in communications with Mary being out on an extended basis.  We should 
probably create a message on Mary's phone that refers callers to someone else 
- ditto on e:mail messages.  Beth, does it make sense for that referral to be 
James, or you, or Vanessa?  Others within our organization that may try to 
reach Mary could have questions about global databases, projects that Joel's 
group had been handling, etc.  I am not trying to put this off on you if you 
don't think it is appropriate - but James and/or Vanessa came to mind as 
possible contacts.  By copy to Hector, I also wonder if we should review 
incoming e:mails that have come to Mary over the last several weeks to see if 
there are some internal requests to which we need to respond.  Let me know

Hi Karen:

Sue did a great job today at the VICA meeting.  I wish I could take Sue and
fellow speaker Fred Pickle up and down the State of California to talk to
business associations about energy.

The audience was very receptive to the presentation.  Now that the energy
crisis has moved off the front page and the legislature is out of session,
people seem better able to absorb the magnitude and long-term ramifications
of long term contracts, the end of direct access, etc.

David Horowitz spent more time talking about telco deregulation than
electricity.  He is clearly more comfortable talking about telco and was
completely unaware of current events at Enron.  David Freeman did not show
up and he didn't send anyone in his place.

Carolyn Casavan, VICA co-chair of the energy & environment committee told
Sue to call if there was anything that VICA could do to support efforts to
reinstate direct access to please call.

Hope you have a good weekend.

Talk to you soon

Sandra"

"Knox---thanks for taking the time to consider Felix Todaro's case. I met 
Felix 10 years or so ago when he was referred to me through the Houston 
Volunteer Lawyers Program. Felix wanted a divorce and custody of his then 6 
year old daughter. His wife had a drug problem and he did not think his 
daughter would  be safe in her care, After a brief court case, he was awarded 
custody of his daughter who is now a student at Deer Park High School. Felix 
called me two years ago and asked if I could help him w/ his divorce from his 
second wife. Felix tried to go through the HVLP but was over their income 
threshold. I asked David Schwab(Elizabeth Dodge' husband) at Bracewell to 
handle it as a favor to me. At the time,  Felix had a job at a laundry 
company making an hourly fee--- he has since left that job and now works at a 
garage making $500(gross) per week. He was unemployed for the first six 
months of 2000 and he has no assets. Felix and his second wife had a 2 year 
old daughter at the time of his second divorce. Although Felix seriously 
considered fighting for custody, he thought his second wife was a good mother 
and gave up the fight. Felix was named possessory conservator under his 
divorce decree. Felix agreed to pay child support and he tells me he is 
current. Shortly after their divorce, his ex-wife asked his permission to 
move to Iowa, where her family lived. Felix let her go. He has not seen his 
daughter in two years. Last month he heard that his ex-wife was dying of 
brain cancer and asked if he could see his daughter in Iowa. His mother in 
law denied him access. Last month his ex-wife died. I wrote a letter to the 
mother in law  asking for the orderly transfer of the child to Felix. An 
attorney called me to inform me that the grandmother would resist. Obviously, 
I am not in a position to help Felix, but I was hoping that V&E would take on 
his case. Please let me know asap whether you can help."

The Senate Energy Committee is holding a hearing Wednesday morning at 8am in 
room 4203 to debate AB 5x and AB 6x.  These are the measures that passed the 
ECA committee last week, relating to the ISO/PX governing boards, and utility 
retention of generation assets.
 
AB 1x passed out of the Assembly Appropriations Committee this evening with 
all the Dems voting for it and one Republican.  There were three amendments: 
1) a $400 million price tag was added, 2) a sunset review after 5 years was 
added, and 3) clarification was made that DWR is not permitted to get into 
the T&D business.  Rumor has it that Keeley understands that the 5.5 cents 
has to come out of the bill on the Senate side.  The floor vote is schedule 
for 8pm tonight.

"I agree that we should not be opposing rate caps for small customers and 
schools, but I think we should be pounding on the fact that market 
participants have been putting offers in front of sdge and that allowing the 
market to provide this solution is superior to legislated caps that require 
the creation of huge deferrals (and more problems in the future).
Can we make that argument work?

Subject: Re: Daily Update/ Legislative activity - 08/24/00  

I attended Cmmr. Wood's two-day hearing on Wholesale Markets, which concluded 
today (8/24) in San Diego.  Three Commissioner's were present (Wood, Lynch 
and Neeper) with Duque and Bilas participating by phone.  Administrative Law 
Judge Wetzel was present and a transcript was taken.  The quasi-legislative 
hearing was the beginning of a record developed for the investigation into 
the workings of wholesale/retail markets.  This session focused on Wholesale 
markets.  There will be subsequent sessions on retail issues, market 
structure and other related issues in the future.  My conclusion from this 
session is that Wood is looking for support for increasing regulatory 
intervention in the market.

Dan Larcamp, Director of the Office of markets, Tariffs and Rates, FERC, was 
present.  He relayed FERC's concern of this matter and a desire to hold 
hearings in San Diego.  He also relayed that Hoecker held a press conference 
announcing the opening of a 206 investigative proceeding into the operation 
of the wholesale markets in California, which carried with it refund 
authority.

The format of the hearing was to respond to pre-filed questions developed by 
Wood/Lynch.  Each member of the panel would respond to the questions and any 
questions posed by the Commissioners, the Judge or the CPUC Attorney.  No 
questions were posed by members of the audience.  Yesterday's panel of 
academics were comprised of:

1.  Dr. Timothy Duane-UC Berkley
2.  Dr. William Hogan-Harvard
3.  Dr. Frank Wolak-Stanford (ISO Market Surveillance Committee)
4.  David Marcus-Energy Consultant for the Coaltion of Utility Employees
5.  Dr. Gene Coyle
6.  Dr. Jean-Michel Glachant, Universite Paris I Pantheon Sorbonne

The panel was asked to speak as individuals and not on behalf of any 
institutions they may represent.  While the purpose of the panel seemed to be 
to determine that market power was being exercised and that prices were too 
high and therefore not just and reasonable, the panelist stopped short of 
blaming generators and market participants in behaving illegally.  The 
concensus generally was that market power did exist at various times, but the 
mere existence did not constitute bad behavior.  None, with the exception of 
Dr. Wolak who is in the process of doing a study using recent data as part of 
his role for the Market Surveillance Committee, had done a study.  There was 
some discussion, though not much, of the monopsony power of the utilities.  I 
think ultimately the group conceded that scarcity of supply amplified 
concerns about the exercise of market power, as even the increase in gas 
costs did not fully explain the recent spikes.  Wolak believes that encourage 
utilities to enter into forward purchases will reduce the exercise of 
real-time market power. 

Hogan seemed to be there with Sempra's interests in mind.  He continued to 
promote expansion of the ISO's abilities to dispatch load as well as maintain 
system reliability.  There was alot of discussion about forward purchase 
ability for utilities so as to be less subject to volatile market prices.  
The concerns were also discussed about the appropriateness of a distribution 
utility making purchasing decisions on behalf of its customers.  This 
included discussion of separation of these functions and the default provider 
role.  

Most everyone agreed that rolling back to a regulated market was not feasible 
without raising other major and serious concerns, however there seemed to be 
support for some interim measures where cost-of-service regulation may be a 
good idea and that was during peak periods.  All agreed that a demand 
response, and price signals, are important in the long-run, although not to 
the extent currently experienced in San Diego.

Today's panel included representatives from SDG&E, SCE and PG&E, TURN, UCAN 
and ORA.  

While yesterday's panel maintained objectivity as to whether or not 
generators were exercising market power to the detriment of the system, 
today's panel made no bones about the generators being to blame.

SCE/PG&E indicated their need for relief for recovery of market costs in 
excess of the rate freeze.  SDG&E was still on the hot seat for their 
inaction in hedging any of their supply.  SDG&E brought up their failed PBR 
proposal and ORA and UCAN thought that that may be one way to incent the 
utility to be more responsible with their purchases.

UCAN discussed the Governor's direction and the potential for putting rate 
caps into affect for residential and small commercial.  He mentioned that C&I 
customers are experience difficulties as well.  

TURN raised the need for cost-based bid caps and cost-based peaking 
contracts.  Mike Florio, TURN, urged against any further divestitute of 
assets and alleged market concentration on those assets that had been 
divested.  In fact, TURN urged the Commission to seek legislation to clarify 
the Commission's authority to order retention of assets.

Neeper urged that part of the solution should be changing the current 
requirement to use the PX as the only authorized exchange, although TURN 
disagreed.

Subject: Daily Update/ Legislative activity - 08/24/00

Siting related bills

1. Good new - The Williamson Act passed the Senate 34-1, It should be heard 
at the assembly Saturday or Monday if it is not redirected to a Committee 
hearing.

2. There was a long meeting with Ducheny with regards to AB 970. The enviro's 
boycotted, they want to draft a bill with Keeley. Labor was obstructionist - 
they wanted to gut all the expediting siting  language with regards to all 
facilities except for the peaking plants.  

Rate Cap related bills
1. The Edison Language on Rate Stabilization may not go anywhere. Edison has 
not found an author because of the efforts of Enron and others lobbying 
against it. Furthermore there are signs that Gov. Davis opposes it.

2. The Governor's office has issued a proposed language for a rate cap bill. 
The language however is not available as of yet. It may be released today or 
tomorrow. SDG&E has shown concerns over the content of the bill. They seem to 
think that it is worse than initially proposed by the Governor in his press 
release. 
The bill includes retroactive rate caps through 6/1/00. 
The rate cap could reflect Wood's rate cap proposal (6.5 cts cap on the 
energy component
The bill does not specify who or how the costs associated with the cap will 
be recovered. (The reasoning is that UDCs will be more cautious in their 
procurement if there is uncertainty on who is responsible for the costs.)
All of this is speculative. We hope to see the actual language soon.

3. Enron has been working with the Republican leadership to promote a rate 
cap proposal similar to the amended language we have proposed for AB2290.
The bill focuses only on SDG&E customers and our major principals are the 
following. 
The Interim Rate Cap should be limited to residential and small commercial 
customers, plus specific institutions that have a significant public role, 
such as schools and hospitals.  
The Interim Rate Cap should be limited to the period ending December 31, 2001.
The Interim Rate Cap must be structured so that any undercollection is 
eventually recovered from the same customers who benefit from the lower rates 
provided by the rate cap.

"Hi Charlotte,

We are starting to check out our options for the summer, and one of the 
things we are considering is the day camp that Enron is involved with.  They 
pick up and deliver from the Enron building, and I was wondering if you might 
consider picking Michael up from here (Enron).  I suspect most days he could 
go to your place.

I have no idea if this is the direction we will go, but I thought I would run 
it by you early on.  I have to think about how much travel I might have, as 
it might be hard on Neil to take Michael downtown in the morning.  Paige has 
applied for a job at Enron, though, so if that worked out we would be in good 
shape.

Here's a link.   They have some neat themes.

http://www.kidventurecamp.com/camp_enron.htm

Have you heard of any other good day camps?  You seem to be plugged in fairly 
well.

Thanks,

Kay

"Though announced yesterday that Davis and the Assembly Democratic leadership had cut a deal on an MOU for Edison, considerable uncertainty remains:

The legislative language describing ""the deal"" still has not been released. (We'll get the details out just as soon as they are available.)
Of the provisions rumored to be in the deal, Burton (Democratic leader in the Senate) has said publicly that spreading the utility undercollection over customers 20 KW and higher is a ""nonstarter in the Senate"".  (The Senate bill forces 500 KW-and-above customers to pay for Edison's undercollection (which amounts to about 3600 customers behind Edison.  Wall Street has said that 3600 customers is insufficient to securitize the undercollection.).
Unless the costs are spread across 20 KW-and-above customers, business is likely to oppose the bill strongly.
Business may also oppose the bill if it doesn't provide for ""meaningful"" Direct Access and self-gen, but at this point business seems to care more about spreading the undercollection than Direct Access.
There is no indication yet that Davis and the Democratic leadership in the Assembly have convinced a majority of Assembly Democracts to vote for the deal; but Davis is pushing very hard and the assumption is that he'll get the votes in the Assembly if he continues to push.
However, given Burton's comments, it's unclear whether the Senate goes along, even if Davis manages to push something through the Assembly.  But if Davis and the Assembly want it badly enough, the likelihood is that they will pass a bill that meets Burton's requirements and that Burton will move through the Senate.
Bryson, CEO of Edison, has said publicly that he doesn't know whether the deal will make Edison solvent.
Consumer groups are strongly opposed to any deal for Edison, saying 1) bankruptcy's the best answer and 2) they will run ""the Mother of all ballot initiatives"" to roll back any ""bailout.""
As of 1:06 PM CDT, PCG is trading at 16.47 (down 0.07); Edison's trading at 13.94 (down 0.07).

Best,
Jeff"

Subject: Due Diligence Questions


Gentlemen,

Attached is a list of due diligence questions for the Enron generation
assets (Wheatland, Lincoln, Gleason and LV Cogen).  We would very much
appreciate your help is getting answers for by Friday, 10/20 if possible.

Unfortunately, we are still having significant difficulty in accessing
documents on DealBench.  The download time is usually several minutes to a
half hour per document and often the larger documents will not fully print
out on our systems.  Two of our consultants have experienced similar
difficulties which suggests that whatever problems we are facing are not
unique to systems at PECO.

We are concerned that the limited information will impact our ability to
bid on the assets.  Would it be possible to receive from you either a print
out of the documents or the documents on CD ROM?

Mike Cazaubon

		 Subject: Confidential: Follow-up re Action Items from 3/15 IEP Lobbyist Ca 
ll and 3/16 drafting meeting on 60x


This email is a follow-up to yesterday's lobbyist conference call and
today's meeting re potential language changes on 60x.  Attached are two sets
of draft amendment language that were discussed today consistent with a
general strategy on the bill that was discussed yesterday.  That strategy,
generally speaking, keys off an expected Calpine meeting with Hertzberg on
Monday, and is as outlined again below.  Comments / concerns with language
and/or general strategy should go to Julee for IEP by Monday COB for
consideration in next steps as mentioned in the action items.

The anticipated approach with the Hertzberg will be:

A) Persuade him that the ""California First!"" notion as presented in this
bill (and elsewhere) is not a good policy approach and that the bill should
be killed because: it will be interpreted as protectionist by other states
and will lead them to retailiate; it will isolate California from existing
supplies elsewhere that could help serve California loads; it could deny CA
access to new generation built in other states that could help CA; it will
slow CA projects ""in the pipeline""; it will undermine existing commercial
arrangements that developers have _with_ California entities from CA
projects in the pipeline, etc.

If this does not happen, then ...

B) Persuade him to change the bill into something else (as in
carrot/incentive and not a stick that increases commercial and development
risks);

if this does not work and he will consider alternate language which does not
disrupt existing arrangements, then ...

C1) Take the more extensive ""bulletproof"" language, attached as ""C1"", which
protects any existing commercial arrangements and provides a method to bring
buyers and sellers together via a notice to interested purchasers maintained
by the CEC;

if that does not work and he will consider alternate language on another
approach which will not disrupt existing arrangements, then ...

C2) Take the ""offer to negotiate"" language, attached as version ""C2"", which
was the language developed and circulated yesterday (with the addition of
irrigation districts to the list of folks to whom the offer to negotiate is
extended),

and if that doesn't work, then

D) he wants to disrupt existing commercial relationships and he wants to
adopt a protectionist ""California First!"" policy which we cannot fix or
support.

Subject: Action Items from Today's Lobbyist Call


ACTION ITEMS from today's IEP member company lobbyist conference call:

AB 60x (Hertzberg)
- Calpine will attempt to get a meeting with the Speaker on Monday regarding
his interest in other ""California First"" avenues, and report the results to
IEP.

- In anticipation of using Plan B, there will be a drafting meeting on
Friday (3/16) at 11am in IEP's office to fine-tune the current IEP proposed
amendments (attached).

- All available lobbyists will push the Speaker's office to hold off on
moving the bill until IEP has had an opportunity to present language.

- E+M will schedule a follow-up conference call on this issue early in the
week.

- IEP will explore the possibility of an editorial campaign regarding the
poor direction of this ""California First"" issue, tying it to long-term
contracting.


SB 6x (Burton)
- Review IEP proposed amendments to soften the eminent domain language
(attached).

- All available lobbyists will make contact with the Pro tem's office to
support the IEP amendments.


AB 8x (Migden)
- Review IEP comments that mitigate the EOB's authority in the coordinate of
operation and maintenance scheduling (attached).

- All available lobbyists will make contact with Assembly Member Migden's
office to support a stakeholder meeting taking place, because IEP would like
to make this bill work.


SB 39x (Speier)
- IEP will explore the possibility of including in its PR efforts on
maintenance and outages, the IOU- and labor-run nuclear facility being down
for an extended period of time.

PLEASE SHARE ANY INFORMATION YOU GET WITH ME FROM YOUR CONTACT WITH ANY OF
THE ABOVE-NAMED MEMER'S OFFICES.

THANKS.

FYI.  Can you and the clerks handle packing up my office?  I may be able to 
help but I don't want to make any commitment  that I can make it up there.  
Hopefully, it won't take that long and the only files that need to be marked 
or perhaps put in the legal assistant area are the files near my window.  If 
the move-out timing slips and happens while you are on vacation, I would 
prefer that it be handled before hand so that the floater doesn't have to

It looks like Phase II of our construction project (over where Julia's office 
used to be) will be finished on the 18th so she will be moving into her new 
office that weekend.  I now have the plans for Phase III and it turns out 
your office will be included in the construction area.  Phase III will 
probably start on the 25th.  That could always slip but I wanted to give you

Hope you are all doing well.  Getting any sleep yet?

Subject: Transfer price for the LM 6000's for Electrobolt

Marcelo and John,

As we have discussed before, we need to document that the price we are using 
for the LM6000's for Electrobolt  is ""fair market value"".     There are 
several third party sales at Enron that may be applicable to help with this 
exercise.    Kay Mann has offered to help with this,  but  to compare 
Electrobolt's LM6000's to the other sales, we need the equipment list for the 
LM6000's---i.e. what attachments are included with these LM 6000's.    

Kay, what do you need to help with this.   Is it a full equipment list, or 
some other equipment summary.    Could you please describe.   I believe 
Marcelo or John Ayres are the most likely to be able to provide the 
information, but am not quite sure what to ask for.      Thanks.

Subject: Gov Geringer meeting

Steve/RIck ---as you may be aware, Governor Geringer personally asked Ken Lay 
to come to the kick off meeting of the Wyoming Energy Task Force, a group 
that was created by legislative mandate last month.  The meeting is on May 
30th in Cheyenne.  Mr. Lay told the Governor that he would not be able to 
make it on that date, but promised that a senior Enron exectutive would be 
there.  I spoke with Governor Geringer's staff person again this past week 
and was hoping that Paul Kaufman could be the senior executive, but no such 
luck (unless you give Paul a huge new title!).  

In talking with Maureen I understand that you have a previous conflict Steve, 
but I am hoping that you can review your calendar to see if you could make an 
adjustment in order to meet the request of the Governor.  Your speech would 
be in the morning--I've been told about 9 o clock or so---which would allow 
for you to leave by noonish.

"PLEASE FORWARD TO ANYONE APPROPRIATE:

Judge Wagner issued a public Proposed Recommendation (the media was in the 
room) to resolve the matters before the Settlement process late Monday 
afternoon.

He initially talked about ""can bring a horse to water, but can't make him 
drink.""  

He went on to detail that the Suppliers had offered $716.1MM for Settlement 
($510MM for Duke, Dynegy, Mirant, Williams, Reliant + $125MM for Powerex + 
$49.6MM for 15 marketers + $6.5MM for 6 CMUA members + $25MM for outside 
Calif Utilities [includes PGE]).  He said thought refunds in the hundred of 
$millions or maybe $1billion were right.

His will propose the following method to the Commission.  

1. Retroactively apply the June 19 Order from Oct 2 - June 19.
2. Modify that decision to (a) use actual heat rates from marginal unit in 
NP15 and SP15, (b) use two daily gas prices - north CA and south CA, (c) 
incorporate NOx costs, (c) add a 10% credit premium.
3. Commission should hold an expedited 60 day hearing on matters relating to 
questions of material facts (Mwh sold, gas prices, etc).

He did indicate that his perspective was that the moneys owed could be offset 
against CAISO bills.

Importantly, we are unsure if the Judge will recommend to have FERC  (a) 
determine that upon the application of this refund Order the rates are 
determined to be J&R, (b) ensure that all buyers in these markets get similar 
refunds, (c) limit the refund to not include CDWR and CAISO Out-of-Market 
transactions.

We are intending to communicate with the Judge's staff tomorrow on these 
issues to seek clarity.

Finally, is it appropriate to have Charles River Associates attempt to 
calculate the refund liability?  We may want to understand the risk under 
different assumptions.

Thanks,

Jim"

"This link should get you access to our Financial Trading, or ""Master Swap 
Agreement"" database.  This database lists all the master swap agreements we 
have in place or have drafted in the US, London, Singapore, Japan, South 
America, etc..  It is a very good resource to use when preparing 
confirmations.  This database is available to all Enron employees, so feel 
free to send this link to any London employees you think might find it 
helpful.  There are certain comments concerning the status of masters under 
negotiation that are only available to Legal and Credit employees because of 
legal-client confidentiality concerns.  Any member of your legal team should 
be able to look at those comments to determine if there is active/close 
negotiation on a master, or if a master is being amended, what the amendments 
might address (sometimes helpful when Houston isn't at work yet!).  
Frequently there may be more than one master in place for an Enron company, 
so look at each entry to determine whether the master is limited to a 
specific finance project or product (unusual, but sometimes).  Also, as I 
mentioned, not all the US based masters are ISDA Multi-Currency Masters, so 
look to confirm what type of master we entered into.  If they are not ISDA 
Multi-Currency Masters, it may not be possible to put a cross-border trade 
under the master without some modification to the master or confirmation.

Please note:  there is a listing for ""Restrictions"" which will reflect any 
trading limitations such as ""crude oil trades only"", ""no trades over 2 
years"", contain special confirmation issues or list other types of trading 
limitations.  Restrictions should ALWAYS be looked at because they contain 
critical trading guidance.  Another note to watch out for is that many US 
based master may have Texas law instead of NY.  Certainly not UK law.  We 
hope to have that information available in the database in the future.

If for some reason you can't access this database, let me know and we'll get 
our respective computer people to figure out why.

As I mentioned, I am a paralegal in the Houston swap group and am happy to 
answer any questions about particular masters, so please do not hesitate to 
call me at x33399.

Subject: FW: Midway Project - Generic Interconnect Agreement

Fred / Kay:

I spoke to Duran this morning, and he and I would like to meet together with 
us to discuss the Midway project and whether or not we will be able to 
utilize TurboPark Phase 2. I previously told him that because of timing 
considerations and because there may be certain agreements that will be 
difficult to make TurboPark compliant (such as the attached interconnect 
agreement from FPL), that Phase 2 may not be practical for purposes of this 
project.

I think this would be a good discussion to have on Friday, because we should 
have more information on the GE7FAs and should have already spoken with TECO 
on their proposed MOU (and maybe even the tolling agreement). What are your 
schedules on Friday?

I also would like to schedule a call for tomorrow with TECO to go over the 
MOU. Fred - Please coordinate with Kay and schedule something with Becky 
Alex. I would prefer the afternoon if that's OK with you guys, and would like 
45 min. before the call for us to meet seperately. Also Fred, please advise 
on the status of the tolling agreement.

Kay - attached is FPL's standard form interconnect agreement. I was thinking 
that Carlos would be a good choice to review it as he is currently working 
with accounting / finance on an Ameren interconnect, so he will already be 
familiar with the likely issues. Please let me know what you think. It will 
be important to give Duran a summary of likely accounting / finance issues 
related to this agreement on Friday. 

Hope you both had good weekends.

"Great summary.  I think the two main issues you raise are the right ones, but 
I have one other thought we should discuss internally.  Do we want to create 
a set of incentives for the management of PJM that would entitle management 
to incentive compensation to the extent they meet certain goals -- eg 
relieving congestion on the grid, increasing throughput across the 
transmission system, expediting interconnection (measured in terms of actual 
interconnections not just applications approved), etc.  This way we could 
create an organization that would have the incentive to make a workable and 
open transmission system.

Subject: PJM RTO Order

Attached is a summary of the PJM RTO order.  While it is somewhat lengthy, 
the order has a lot of good information in it that I wanted to share with the 
group, particularly the Commission's statements regarding the existing 
configuration of the northeast and the need to expand it.

We are working on summaries of the New York and New England RTO orders and 
will have those out shortly.  If you would like copies of the orders, just 
let us know.

We expect the mediation proceeding to begin within the next week.  We will 
keep you updated.

Dale,

My recommendation is to make Steve the head of the research unit in London.
We were talking originally about September but I think we should accelerate 
this process.
Of course, Anjam will be very unhappy about it, but we cannot manage around 
him
any longer.

I think that the promotion should be combined with a salary increase.
I would like to offer him a significant increase that
goes with expanded responsibilities and much higher visibility.
A salary increase will also bring him closer to the market.
 We see the market for  technical people going through the roof in 
practically every location
where we operate.

A contract is not a good solution in my view. It creates a sense of false 
security for
both an employee and the company.

I shall send a message to John Sherriff with my recommendation. I shall cc 
you.
I would appreciate if you could bring it up with John as well.

Vince

Subject: Steve Leppard

Hi Vince,

HR is working on a mid-year salary review for London people that have a 
noticeable gap between their compensation at Enron and what we would have to 
pay in the market for a replacement.  They highlighted Steve as someone with 
a potential gap - particularly in light of what we're seeing in our quant 
recruiting effort for credit trading and research.

I'd like your opinion on the best way to make sure we keep Steve happy and 
keep him at Enron.  There are several things I see we can do:

1)  Give him a mid-year pay increase to move him closer to market.  I'm not 
sure this is the best way to go, especially if we only offer him a token 
salary increase.

2)  Offer him more responsibility:  What are your thoughts on timing for 
making Steve the official head of the London research team?  With my move to 
EBS, should we accelerate this?  I think this is good way to keep him happy 
and motivated, and then follow up with a more meaningful salary review at 
year-end (as part of the regular process) that takes into account his greater 
responsibility.

3)  We have some people that we're trying to get under long-term (3-yr) 
contract with a 12-month notice clause.  Obviously anyone signing one of 
these will want significant up-front compensation for being handcuffed.  
We've not had a lot of success with these here in London, and I would prefer 
to keep Steve happy so he wants to stay with Enron rather than contractually 
binding him to the job.

I'd value your thoughts on this.

Thanks,

Dale

"To forecast Entex:

We have a database that contains the citygate volumes by day, with the low 
and high temps for each day.  When we get a weather report for the new day, 
we enter the projected low temp and the spread into the file.  The database 
is sorted by that information with a +/- 2 degrees on the temps, and provides 
an average volume for that criteria.  (For example:  With temps of 40-60, the 
sort would produce a list of the volumes pulled for each day with a low of 38 
to 42 degrees and a temperature spread of 20 to 22 degrees.  An average is 
then calculated from that volumetric data.  In this case, the average is 
calculated to 259,000 Mmbtu.)  Upon calculating the average, we then apply 
information we obtain through daily business and adjust that estimate.  
Things to consider:  if weather is cloudy or sunny, wet or dry;  wind chill;  
Entex's obligation on Midcon;  Entex's recent operating procedures;  Entex 
takes versus our prior estimates (have we been under or overestimating 
volumes each day), etc.

Additionally, since we only see about 30% of the meters, we apply a factor to 
estimate the remaining 70%.  If we have an unaccounted volume for a few days 
that is fairly consistent (and we have determined that the ua4 has not been 
caused by something else), we may adjust the factor to bring the estimates 
more in line.

Let me know if you have any questions.

"Thanks, Harry.  I want to re-enforce the switching issue, since EES is likely 
to be very focused on moving customers back to the utility on Tuesday.  
Switching would certainly reduce EES' going-forward exposure to 1) growing 
""credit receivables"" that the utilities refuse to pay and 2) the risk that 
the Commission will end the rate freeze altogether---and the PX credit with 
it--as part of the hearing process that commences with the pre-hearing 
conference on Wednesday.  Reducing that exposure is clealry important to EES.

But the utilities' ability to resist taking back customers is likely to be 
significant, particularly since 90% of the volumes that we serve are on Enron 
meters.  Imagine the road blocks that the utility can/will construct over the 
""complex process""  of changing-out the meters.  In addition, when CA border 
gas prices spiked several weeks ago, many large gas customers tried to switch 
from noncore to core service on SoCalGas' system.  SoCalGas submitted an 
emergency motion at the Commission to prevent the switching and the 
Commission granted it in the wink of an eye.

It will be important for EES to drill down fairly deeply in its analysis of 
all the ways that the utility can frustrate any switching.  Otherwise, we may 
find ourselves confronting a lot of negative PR without having reduced any of 
EES' exposure.  Customers who have been unwillingly switched back to the 
utility have become very vocal about their displeasure and have turned 
negative on ESPs as a result.

Best,
Jeff

These 3 issues will be discussed at your Tuesday afternoon meeting with EES:

what to do about forcing the utilities to pay delinquent PX credits
Through December, the total arrearage is about $220M total, mostly from 
PG&E.  Neither utility is paying.  Vicki Sharpe is lining up bankruptcy 
counsel.

should the new 1 cent surcharge be passed on to our customers
Vicki has not said yet whether our contracts allow passthrough, although she 
has hinted it would require a very aggressive interpretation of the contract.
 
should we try to return our customers to utility bundled service
Aside from the modifications to our customer contracts that have to take 
place, an even stickier issue is to get the utilities to take them back.  
Even if the utilities are required to do so, forms have to be processed and 
meters have to be changed out.  (We have our own meters on our accounts.)  
This could not happen quickly.  Of course, this action mitigates against the 
risk of the rate freeze ending but does nothing for the credit problem, other 
than to keep the exposure from getting larger.

On Wednesday, there will be a pre-hearing conference at the CPUC on the next 
phase of the end-the-rate-freeze case.  Jeff and I have talked about this and 
think we can decide what our involvement will be (witnesses, positions, etc.) 
after a schedule is set.  For now, the strategy is to make sure the CPUC on 
Wednesday adopts a schedule that deals with all the issues they must deal 
with about the rate freeze. 

(Rick, I will be in San Francisco through Wednesday meeting with Mike Day and 
working with Roger Yang to identify all those issues.)

Gerald,

Due to some changes in our business, we are needing to amend the current 
transportation contracts for HPL transporting on HPL.  We will need to amend 
the current 012-41500-02-003 contract, covering the transportation cost from 
a particular wellhead all the way to Houston Ship Channel, to become two 
contracts, one we call the ""gathering agreement"" (covering transportation 
cost from the wellhead to a competitive supply curve like Thompsonville zone 
or Agua Dulce zone) and then another agreement we call ""marketing 
transportatin agreement"" (covering transportation cost from the competitive 
supply curve to Houston Ship Channel).

We need these amendments to be effective as soon as possible since we are 
targeting making the administrative changes effective during November 
production month.  I tried to call you but was not able to be connected to 
your voice mail.

I would like to sit down with you in the next couple of days to discuss this 
change and what we need to do to have the agreements changed and the new 
gathering agreement put into place.  Please respond via email or call at 
3-1836 to discuss this issue further.  Thanks!

I have reviewed a copy of the notice and summons which were served on ENA by 
Blue Grass Synfuels, et al.  I notice that there was no complaint served with 
the summons.  I assume you will be engaging counsel in New York to represent 
ENA in this matter.  Let me know if there is anything I can do to assist.  
Also, if the complaint is ultimately served on our outside counsel (rather 
than through ordinary service of process) after ENA serves its Notice of 
Appearance, please make sure to send Corporate Risk Management (Jim Studdert) 
a copy of the Complaint, so that it can be reviewed for possible coverage.  I 
know the matter sounds like breach of contract, but it's worth having the

"Dear Mr. Schrum,

I attended Sing! last night to watch and support my daughter perform with her 
Tri Delta friends.  I enjoyed the performances of the various groups, which 
were within the bounds of what I expected.  Unfortunately, I am not writing 
to tell you how much I enjoyed it.

I'm writing  you to encourage the administration to not take lightly the 
indecent exposure incident which occured in the second act.   The act was 
beyond offensive, it was criminal, especially in light of the young children 
present.  During the first act, I was sitting on the first row, and there 
were 4 young children sitting in the front.  In fact,  at the end of the 
first act I had regretted that I had not brought Paige's six year old brother 
to watch her perform.  I cannot tell you how glad I am that I did not bring 
Michael.   Even I was offended, and I'm a forty-two year old lawyer (we don't 
offend easily) who was in a sorority at UT.  I was glad I had moved back at 
intermission to sit with my daughter for the second act.

Again, I urge you to not view this as an act of youthful indiscretion. It was 
offensive to the individuals present, and degrading to a fine university 
which prides itself on ""encouraging contributions toward the well-being of 
humanity"".  My husband, Neil, who was a Pike at SU in the seventies, joins me 
in this request.

Thank you,

Kay Mann

		 Subject: AB 60x to be heard Tues.

Heard from Lawrence this morning who said AB 60x (Hertzberg) is likely to be
heard in the Senate Energy Committee on Tuesday next week.  He said the
committee at this time is fairly neutral on the bill since he doesn't see
that it does anything.  He understands our problems with the bill, but
suggested we may want to recommend a solution.  IEP will be meeting with him
this afternoon to give him the problem at the 50,000 foot level.  Individual
companies may want to give him the specifics.

Where are we with our meetings with members of the committee?

IEP met with Kip in Sher's office who was noncommittal, but agreed with our
arguments against the bill. IEP's meeting with Alarcon was cancelled.  We
are trying to reschedule.  Since this is a special session bill, Dunn and
Poochigian will be voting on the bill.

Regarding above in the Kansas case, I am preparing the pro rata reimbursement 
checks from the Holland & Hart trust account to Enron and EOG.  To whom shall 
I send the EOG check?  Shall I send both checks to your attention?

"Hi Lee:

Looks great.  Could you do me a favor?  You have ""generating company"" rep on 
the agenda.  Enron does not see itself as a generating company.  In fact, the 
only generation that we own in California is 50+ MWs of wind power in 
Southern California.  Could you change it to ""energy service provider"" rep?  
Hope that's not a problem.

Best,
Jeff"

Vince,

I met with Niki last week in which we had a general interview on his interests.  He is finding that he is not fully utilizing his skills at Optimark and that the company is moving more towards software development.  Consequently he is looking at other possibilities.  He obviously has an interesting background that includes systems development, management and a strong technical training.  Ideally, he could fit somewhere between research and systems development.  Somewhat of a unique combination.  He also has a background in derivatives and other financial instruments.  In short, he could be very interesting for us in supporting Asian activities, but also if you saw a fit within your research group.

I told Niki that I would pass his cv along to you.  Pls let me know if you are able to make contact and see a possibility for him at Enron.

thanks.

Joe

Thank you very much for sparing your time with me, yesterday, and explaining
Enron's dynamic and aggressive business.  It was very impressive and
intriguing.

I have revised my resume and have added information regarding the actual
systems and projects which I have worked on both for Salomon Brothers and
Toshiba.  I have attached a list of publication also.

Please feel free to let me know if you need further information.

I will await for a feedback from you, regarding where I might fit in within
the Enron organization.

Best Regards
Niki"

"Hi Kathleen,

I want to get Laura Luce to direct us to give Gregg signing authority.  As 
you know, the request for Ben came from Janet, not Ben. I'll check with her.  
do you have the LLC agreement to see how changes are handled?  If not, you 
can get a copy of my copy.  It is not a standard agreement.

On the CA, please make the effective period two years from the latest 
disclosure of info, and the disclosures will be ongoing. I don't have the CA 
in front of me, but does it say that Peoples has to get their consultants to 
sign a CA as well?  It is a good question.

Ta ta for now,

Kay

Kay,

Gregg posed an interesting question yesterday regarding the Confidentiality 
Agreement.  If Peoples supplies our confidential information to Arthur 
Andersen, and someone from AA tells the world our secrets, would Peoples be 
on the hook pursuant to our CA?  I guess one way we could take care of this 
would be to include Arthur Andersen on Schedule I of the CA as one of 
Peoples' Representatives.  Any thoughts?

Also, I will work on getting Gregg signing authority re his message below.

Subject: Re: enovate stuff

Kathleen - This e-mail should aid in the preparation of the Board 
Resolutions.  The attached file lists the appointment changes.  As for my 
signature authority, I am expecting that I would need to sign on behalf of 
enovate, L.L.C., Enron MW, L.L.C. and I suppose Enron North America by 
association.  The dollar amount can be set as low as practical.  I think in 
the L.L.C. agreement the Board reserves the right to approve contracts in 
excess of $50,000.  The real need is for pushing paper such as CA's, Master 
Purchase Agreements, etc.  Here is another question, if my authority is 
limited, who has the authority to sign in excess of my limit?  Laura Luce 
previously had such authority as General Manager (she is a VP at ENA).  If 
she now becomes the Board Member, can she also sign on behalf of enovate?  If 
so, is that because she is an officer of Enron MW or because she is a Board 
Member (i.e., can Peoples Board Member sign on behalf of enovate)?

Thanks - Gregg

1)

3) I think we want it to apply to whatever entity employs the individuals 
with access.  Most of these people will probably Peoples Energy Corp. 
employees, but I suppose we could make it also include all of their 
affiliates.  enovate can sign the CA as well, but since enovate doesn't have 
any employees I was assuming we could use Peoples Energy as the responsible 
legal entity.

4) After 3:00 is fine, let me know for sure soon enough that I can lock Sarah 
up.

Subject: enovate stuff

Kay - 

1) Attached is my quick attempt at writing something to make the management 
changes at enovate that we discussed.  Could you please review this and add 
the appropriate legal language.  I don't think that we need any Board 
approval for any of these changes, so is some type of notification sufficient?

2)  I would like to address the idea of signature authorities other than 
Laura at the same time.  My suggestion would be that Richard and myself be 
granted some level of authority to execute CA's, Master Agreements, etc. that 
have been reviewed and approved by legal.  If you can at least pull the 
template you used to get approval for the Director you mentioned and see if 
there would be any changes necessary that would be helpful.

3) I need to get the CA form for the curves and other information started.  
We can discuss this any time you want.

4) What is your availability tomorrow either 8-9:15 or after 3:00 to discuss 
the intercompany loan agreement, and will Heather be available?

I will be leaving around 2:00 for suburban trick or treating.

Thanks,

I work in Portland in West Power tradng and have day-to-day responsibility 
for managing the Can Fibre account.  Since this deal started in Sept. they 
have only paid one invoice and that was paid 16 days late.  They are 
currently 57 days late on one outstanding invoice and 29 days late on 
another.  They have failed to come up with $ despite two ""heart-to-heart"" 
discussions with Dale Hrcak about this issue.  Stone and Webster, the firm 
building their Riverside plant, I guess controls the cash during this 
start-up period and Dale cannot get them to release funds.  They seem 
disorganized and fail to give us straight answers on when we will be paid.  
If Enron did not own a piece of this company I would be talking to credit and 
legal about whether or not Can Fibre is in default and what steps we should 
take to require collateral and/or termiante this agreement.  Instead, Jake 
Thomas indicated that I should talk to you re: next steps. Could you give me

Subject: Re: Foreign Exchange from a US entity  

David

The US entity we're considering at the moment is an FCM, regulated by the 
CFTC and which is a member of NYMEX/COMEX. It currently clears the NY 
exchanges metals business for the group. It will probably be utilised to 
clear the NY exchange energy business following the Enron tie up. It may 
assist in clearing CSCE business but is unlikely at this stage to be looking 
to be a CSCE exchange member. 

It currently has capital of $2 million and subordinated debt of $20 million. 
Profits are generally paid out in the form of a dividend so although it may 
have a small amount of retained profit it won't be material. Currently it has 
about $10 million of regulatory capital requirements.

Depending on your advice, we may consider an un-regulated company with, at 
the moment, not very much capital. This latter point could be rectified, 
either with subordinated debt or capital injection. The EFP customer 
facilities (approximately 50% of the business) may prohibit this.

I hope this is enough info.

Subject: Re: Foreign Exchange from a US entity



Thanks.  I will prepare a memo.  One question on your e-mail -- can you give 
me a bit more information about the US entity that will be the FX dealer?  
For example, is it currently regulated in any respect?  Is it, or will it be, 
engaged in any other businesses?  How large is it in terms of assets or net 
worth?  Thanks.  I'll get back to you soon.

Further to our recent telephone conversation, we would be grateful if you 
would
give us a brief written summary on the regulatory and/or legal issues 
governing
a US corporation transacting foreign exchange with US and non-US customers. My
basic understanding of our telephone conversation was that, as a non-bank,
neither the Fed, the SEC nor the CFTC have any jurisdiction. However the
Commodities Exchange Act prohibits us from contracting with certain types of
counterparties.

The potential business we are looking at currently covers outright foreign
exchange with counterparties such as banks, securities houses, funds, 
corporates
and, possibly, high net worth individuals. The business also covers the
provision of EFP facilities for these customers whereby they ultimately 
receive
a currency futures position on the IMM division of the CME or on FINEX. This
latter area is one where, from the Exchanges' points of view, we would
effectively be acting as an executing broker.

I hope this brief description is enough for you to be able to respond but if 
you
have any questions or would like further clarification, you can contact me by
e-mail or by telephone on +44 20 7265 5421.

Thank you for your help in this.

Kind regards.

"Tanya:

SITA now insists on having the Termination Currency and the Contractual 
Currency, except as otherwise agreed in any Transaction/Confirmation, as the 
Euro.  They will not agree to USD.  [By the way, SITA's lawyers had already 
agreed to USD]  Effectively, if we agree to this, the trader will need to 
confirm each deal in USD (Contractual Currency) but if we early terminate, 
the currency will be Euro's (Termination Currency).

What do you want to do?  Other than the Enron Corp. guaranty, we are finished.

"Confidential - Attorney Work Product/Not Discoverable

A. PGE

I. Termination Rights Based on the Failure to Post Collateral

It is possible that we could terminate the following contracts based on PGE's 
or one of its subsidiaries's failure to post collateral as required by the 
underlying contracts"":

1.  PG&E/ENA - Financial ISDA  - Enron exposure $23 million

2.  PGET Power/EPMI - Physical power - Enron exposure $215 million

3. PGE Canada/Enron Canada - Physical gas - Enron exposure $15 million

4.PGE Canada/ENA - Physical gas - Enron exposure $1 million


II. Termination Rights Based on PG&E's Failure to Pay Indebtedness

It is possible that we could terminate the following contracts based on 
PG&E's or one of its subsidiaries's default on indebtedness in excess of a 
threshold (either $100 million or $50 million):

1. PG&E/ENA - Financial ISDA - Enron Exposure $23 million

2. PG&E/EPMI Physical Power -Enron exposure ($90 million)

3.PGET Power/ENA - Physical Coal - Enron exposure $200,000

4.PGET Power/ENA - Financial GTC - Enron exposure ($6.2 million)

5.PGET Power/EPMI - Physical power - Enron exposure (out of the money, 
currently used to net other EEMC power master which is net in the money $215 
million - see contract 2 above)

6.PGE Canada/Enron Canada - Physical gas - Enron exposure $15 million

7.  PGE Canada/ENA -Physical Gas- Enron exposure $1 million

8. PGET Gas/Enron Canada - Enron Exposure ($2.3 million)

9.PGET Gas/ENA -Financial ISDA - Enron exposure $ 48 million

10. PGET Gas/ENA - Physical gas - Enron exposure ($25 million)

11. PGET Gas/EES - Physical gas - Enron exposure ($700,000)

Most of the above agreements are supported by a guaranty from PG&E's parent 
(PG&E Corporation) in the amount of $475,000,000.  We have not yet made 
demand on the parent but could do so after PGE or its other unregulated 
subsidiaries failed to pay amounts due.  

Exposures are approximate as of 1/19/01.  Before terminating, we would need 
to verify actual contract language.

B.  SCE Default

SCE is in default of a contract between SCE and EPMI relating to  a power 
sales position which is out of the money to EPMI approximately ($35 million) 
based upon SCE's failure to make payments on debt in excess of $100 million. 
Under contract we could suspend deliveries (limited period) and then 
terminate and accelerate amounts due.  Amounts payable could offset amounts 
owed by SCE to EPMI or its Affiliates including Enron Wind or Portland 
General.

     Dear Sara,

     The Schedule to the above-referenced Agreement has been forward to me
     for review and comment.  We look forward to completing this Agreement
     with Enron and appreciate your assistance to that end.  I have the
     following comments regarding the Schedule.  In spite of the length of
     this wire, I feel that we do not have many obstacles to bringing this
     Agreement to a mutually agreeable conclusion.

     1. Please confirm the correct legal name of the Enron entity entering
     this Agreement.  Please add a comma to Cargill's name -- Cargill,
     Incorporated.

     2. It is my understanding that we have not received financial info on
     the Enron entity involved in the Agreement.  Can you arrange to have
     those sent to my attention?  We typically establish a Threshold for
     both the entity involved in the Agreement as well as the Credit
     Support Provider.

     3. We will not be providing Quarterly Unaudited financial statements.

     4. Please provide the correct Notice Address for the appropriate Enron
     entity.

     5. Our Notice information is as follows:

     Facsimile No.:  (612) 984-3900
     Telephone No.:  (612) 984-3444

     6. Part 4(h).  We prefer to retain the intent of the ISDA whenever
     possible and, therefore, please delete this clause.

     7. Part 5(b)(j).  Please use the following ISDA-recommended clause in
     place of yours:
     Non-reliance Representation.   The following  shall be added as
     Section 15:
     Relationship Between Parties.

     Each party will be deemed to represent to the other party on the date
     on which it enters into a Transaction that (absent a written agreement
     between the parties that expressly imposes affirmative obligations to
     the contrary for that Transaction):

     (i)   Non-Reliance.  It is acting for its own account, and it has made
     its own independent decisions to enter into that Transaction and as to
     whether that Transaction is appropriate or proper for it based upon
     its own judgment and upon advice from such advisers as it has deemed
     necessary.  It is not relying on any communication (written or oral)
     of the other party as investment advice or as a recommendation to
     enter into that Transaction; it being understood that information and
     explanations related to the terms and conditions of a Transaction
     shall not be considered investment advice or a recommendation to enter
     into that Transaction.  No communication (written  or oral) received
     from the other party shall be deemed to be an assurance or guarantee
     as to the expected results of that Transaction.

     (ii)  Assessment and Understanding.  It is capable of assessing the
     merits of and understanding (on its own behalf or through independent
     professional advice), and understands and accepts, the terms,
     conditions and risks of that Transaction.  It is also capable of
     assuming, and, assumes, the risks of that Transaction.

     (iii)  Status of Parties.  The other party is not acting as a
     fiduciary for or an adviser to it in respect of that Transaction.

     8. Part 5(c).  Please explain your reasoning for this request.  We
     prefer to retain the intent of the ISDA and, therefore, feel it should
     be deleted.

     9. Part 5(f).  Please add the following to this clause:
     Additionally, any such recordings may be submitted in evidence to any
     court or in any proceedings for the purpose of establishing any
     matters pertinent to the Agreement.

     10.Part 5(g).  Please use the following ISDA-recommended clause in place
     of yours:
     Set-off.   The following shall be added as Section 6(f):

     ""Any amount (the ""Early Termination Amount"") payable to one party (the
     Payee) by the other party (the Payer) under Section 6(e), in
     circumstances where there is a Defaulting Party or one Affected Party
     in the case where a Termination Event under Section 5(b)(iv) has
     occurred, will, at the option of the party ('X') other than the
     Defaulting Party or the Affected Party (and without prior notice to the
     Defaulting Party or the Affected Party) be reduced and set-off against
     any amount(s) (the 'Other Agreement Amount') payable (whether at such
     time or in the future or upon the occurrence of a contingency) by the
     Payee to the Payer (irrespective of the currency, place of payment or
     booking office of the obligation) under any other agreement(s) between
     the Payee and the Payer or instrument(s) or undertaking(s) issued or
     executed by one party to, or in favor of, the other party (and the
     Other Agreement Amount will be discharged promptly and in all respects
     to the extent it is so set-off).  X will give notice to the other party
     of any set-off effective under this Section 6(f).

     For this purpose, either the Early Termination Amount or the Other
     Agreement Amount (or the relevant portion of such amounts) may be
     converted by the Non-defaulting Party into the currency in which the
     other is denominated at the rate of exchange at which such party would
     be able, acting in a reasonable manner, in good faith, to purchase the
     relevant amount of such currency.

     If an obligation is unascertained, X may in good faith estimate that
     obligation and set-off in respect of the estimate, subject to the
     relevant party accounting to the other when the obligation is
     ascertained.

     Nothing in this Section 6(f) shall be effective to create a charge or
     other security interest.  This Section 6(f) shall be without prejudice
     and in addition to any right of set-off, combination of accounts, lien
     or other right to which any party is at any time otherwise).

     11.Part 6.  Please delete this Section.  We have found it to be more
     common market practice to retain the intent of the 1993 Commodity
     Derivatives Definitions without modification.

     Thank you for your attention to this Agreement, Sara, and we look
     forward to bringing it to completion in the near future.  Have a
     terrific Thanksgiving holiday!

     Best regards,
     Marty Oelmann

		 Subject: Information for Call to LA Mayor Dick Riordan

Ken -- Thank you for making next Thursday, May 17 available for CEO meetings 
in California.  We are working to set up two meetings -- one in Los Angeles 
and one in Silicon Valley (we'll call on Scott McNealy's contact person to 
help pull the Northern California meeting together).   For the Los Angeles 
meeting, we'd like you to call Mayor Dick Riordan (213-847-3560) and ask for 
his help in pulling together a group of key, influential business leaders.   
As background, Riordan is a very wealthy Republican businessman who has been 
term-limited out and has not yet made public his future political aspirations 
(a bid for governor has been mentioned by insiders).

You might congratulate him on helping to settle the Writer's Guild strike and 
ask if he'd now like to resolve the energy crisis (He's in a bit of a spat 
with Dave Freeman over who can claim credit for LADWP's success during this 
energy situation -- see attached LA Times article).  You can say you've been 
told that he was one of the clearer heads during the deregulation process and 
were instrumental in keeping DWP out of the regulatory mess.

This is an opportunity for Riordan to help broker a solution, and that's why 
you're calling him.  You met with Robert Day (Trust Co of the West) who 
suggested that you call Riordan and enlist his support.  

Explain about our comprehensive solution -- business support is critical to 
garner political support.

You'll be in Los Angeles next Thursday.  Ask if he could invite and host a 
meeting of key business leaders and introduce you.  I've attached a suggested 
list of prominent businessmen, close associates and personal friends of 
Riordan's.  We'd like to position this meeting as an insider's conversation 
of what's going on with the energy situation.  This meeting should be for 
principals only.

Ask Riordan to identify someone in his office who we can work with to set up 
the meeting.  Enron's consultant in LA (Marathon Communications) will work to 
coordinate the event.

If Riordan is not available next Thursday, ask him if he would ask Eli Broad 
(chairman of Sun America and a Democratic billionaire) or Jerry Perenchio 
(chairman of Univision) to host the meeting.

Proposed Invitees

*Eli Broad - Chairman, Sun America
*Ron Burkle - Yucaipa Companies
Jeffrey Katzenberg - DreamWorks
Sherry Lansing- Paramount
Nelson Rising- Catellus

Riordan and Freeman's Feud Erupts in Public 
Power: Each questions the other's role in keeping the city free of 
California's energy crisis. 
By MICHAEL FINNEGAN, TERENCE MONMANEY, Times Staff Writers


?????With California mired in energy troubles, Mayor Richard Riordan and his 
former power chief S. David Freeman trumpet the extraordinary fortune of Los 
Angeles: no rate hikes and no blackouts. 
?????Yet Riordan and Freeman have sullied their mutual success story by 
waging bitter campaigns to discredit each other--at first behind the scenes 
but now in public. 
?????Pettiness, ingratitude, conflicts of interest, overblown claims of 
achievement: Such is the back and forth between two leaders who would seem to 
have good reason to pat each other on the back. 
?????To Freeman, who has resigned as general manager of the L.A. Department 
of Water and Power to become chief energy advisor to Gov. Gray Davis, it 
seems Riordan resents his high-profile role in trying to steer California out 
of the energy crisis. 
?????So the mayor, Freeman charged, has elbowed his way into energy issues 
that he is ill-equipped to handle and taken steps along the way that could 
harm the environment. 
?????""With all due respect, I have 25 years of experience and knowledge--and 
he has 25 days,"" Freeman said. ""But he's the mayor, and he didn't like it 
that I didn't just say yes to everything he came up with."" 
?????To Riordan, Freeman's efforts to fight air pollution have given short 
shrift to the threat of skyrocketing power rates in Los Angeles. The mayor 
said Freeman also failed to recognize potential conflicts of interest between 
his city and state roles in the power crisis. And he scoffed at Freeman for 
saying he had lifted morale at DWP. 
?????""Morale was terrible under him,"" Riordan said. ""I mean, they are so 
relieved right now."" 
?????The backbiting has left associates suspecting the clash is really about 
egos. City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter sees Riordan and Freeman as proud, 
successful men unable to say, ""I couldn't have done it without X, Y and Z."" 
?????""Each of them is used to being the boss and taking pleasure at being 
recognized as the boss,"" she said. 
?????Much of the conflict has taken place in private meetings. And the mayor, 
a Republican multimillionaire, has taken pains to play down his dispute with 
Freeman, a liberal Democrat from Tennessee who wears a cowboy hat and speaks 
with a Southern drawl. 
?????In an interview after his resignation, Freeman laid out the conflict 
point by point, often in terms bluntly critical of the mayor. One of his 
concerns, Freeman said, was that Riordan in his final two months as mayor 
could reverse the agency's progress in protecting the environment. 
?????Freeman cited Riordan's plans concerning coal-fired power plants in 
Nevada and Utah that are partly controlled by the DWP, the nation's largest 
municipal utility. The first is the Mohave Generating Station in Laughlin, 
Nev., a plant that has been blamed for spreading some of the haze that 
shrouds the Grand Canyon. The DWP had planned to sell its stake in the plant, 
but Freeman said Riordan ordered him to back out of the sale. 
?????He described the mayor's move as a sign that Riordan and his appointees 
on the board that oversees DWP were ""completely insensitive to the fact that 
that power plant is one of the most environmentally troubling plants in the 
West."" 
?????""I've worked real hard to try to build some environmental sensitivity 
into the DWP policy,"" Freeman said. ""And I am concerned as to whether the 
current commissioners and the mayor have that sensitivity, and what they 
might do in the interim to basically overturn the progress we've made."" 
?????The other plant is part of the Intermountain Power Project in central 
Utah. Riordan has proposed building a new coal-fired generating unit there, 
but Freeman said he objected because of the pollution it would cause. 
?????In both cases, Riordan said he was striking the appropriate balance 
between protecting the environment and meeting the energy needs of Los 
Angeles at an affordable cost. By keeping its share of the Mohave plant and 
expanding the Utah plant, Los Angeles can avert the astronomical price hikes 
of natural gas--and the sharp rise in ratepayers' bills that would follow, 
Riordan said. 
?????Natural gas, which provides 26% of the fuel for DWP plants, causes less 
air pollution than coal, which provides 51%. The rest is mainly nuclear and 
hydroelectric. Los Angeles has averted rate hikes and blackouts in part 
because the DWP relies less on natural gas than most other California power 
providers. 
?????""I favor clean air and more natural gas, but not to the point where 
we're going to destroy the economy of Los Angeles,"" Riordan said. 
?????On the Mohave plant, Riordan questioned the benefit of selling the 
city's share to a buyer that would simply continue running it. 
?????""It's still going to be coal-driven,"" he said. ""How does selling it help 
the environment?"" 
?????The tension between the two has built steadily as the state power crisis 
has worsened. With the charismatic DWP chief drawing favorable news coverage 
in stories on how L.A. has dodged the crisis, Riordan and the DWP 
commissioners began to view him as ""too big for my britches,"" Freeman said. 
?????The conflict reached its peak on April 17, the day Freeman resigned to 
become the governor's advisor. The DWP board president, Kenneth T. Lombard, 
said the mayor told commissioners that day that ""it made the most sense to 
release him immediately."" 
?????""All we were doing, frankly, was release him from his responsibilities, 
and then whatever time he needed to clean out his office was fine with us,"" 
Lombard said. 
?????From Riordan's standpoint, Freeman needed to be stripped of his 
authority right away because of a potential conflict of interest: The city 
utility sells surplus power to the state, so Freeman would be on both sides 
of the sales. 
?????Freeman, who had voluntarily bowed out of a DWP meeting on the state 
power crisis earlier that day, was outraged at his sudden release, in part 
because he was denied the chance to say goodbye to agency employees. In an 
interview, he called the conflict of interest assertion ""complete malarkey."" 
?????""The insinuation that I have done anything less than protect the 
interests of the city of Los Angeles is bordering on slanderous, considering 
what I've accomplished here,"" he said. 
?????Brian D'Arcy, who heads the union local that represents 6,000 DWP 
employees, agreed that Riordan and his commissioners ""kind of ran him out of 
here. For David to be summarily jettisoned out of here without even a 
howdy-do is absolutely tacky,"" D'Arcy said. 
?????Riordan said Freeman deserves ""an A-plus"" for his work at DWP. The mayor 
conceded that he knew of nothing that Freeman had done ""to hurt Los Angeles."" 
But, he added, ""when you have a conflict of interest, you have to act before 
anything happens."" 
?????Freeman has long bridled at the oversight of DWP, not just by the mayor, 
but by the agency's board and the City Council. In 1998, he called for City 
Charter amendments to consolidate authority in a more independent board of 
directors. The proposal went nowhere. 
?????Freeman's concerns were echoed in a report to be released Monday. The 
Rand Enterprise Analysis report was commissioned by the DWP. It calls for 
restructuring DWP management much the way Freeman proposed. But Riordan and 
Galanter, who chairs the Council's Commerce, Energy and Natural Resources 
Committee, rejected the concept. Copyright 2001 Los Angeles Times

AB 25 creates the Electric Rate Stabilization Auhtority which can arrange 
financing for the utilities' overpayment debt which is defined as the 
liabilities incurred between 6/1/00 and 3/31/01 through purchases of 
electricity from generators or other providers other than themselves, parent 
companies, affiliates,or subdivisions, for which ratepayer revenues were 
insufficient to pay.  This is one of those bills where your eyes glaze over, 
but I think the one area where we may have an issue, or desire clarification, 
is Article 5, PUC ratesetting.  The bill says that the PUC shall fix rates 
for the 3 utilities that provide them with sufficient revenues to pay the 
amounts assessed (by the Stabilization folks).  I think we would like 
language exempting direct access customers from these assessments in the bill 
itself."

Kay,
Lisa asked me to see if you would represent ENA Legal at the meeting
between EE&CC and ENA on Monday, Jan 29th.  Having worked at both
companies, you would add a lot of insight to the crafting of a ""new project
development process"".  The agenda is for Ozzie, Mike Coleman, Lisa and you
to give brief presentations (5-10 minutes each) on the project development
process, with recommendations on changes to be made.  You've already seen
the notes, but I'm attaching an updated version.

Please let me know if you will be available and if you want to change any
discussion bullets and/or recommendations.  The most recent message had the
meeting taking place on Monday, January 29th from 11:30 am to 1:30 pm (with
lunch provided).  Megan will let everyone know which room will be reserved.
There is also a pre-meeting tomorrow (Wed) at 10:30 am in EB 2868 (it
should only last 30 minutes).  Thank you in advance for your help.

In addition, DWR takes the position that, if the Commission does not enact a July 1 retroactive suspension date, the Commission should require that all customers who went DA after July 1 pay a proportionate share of the bonds and DWR going-forward contracts.
Customers and providers will strongly oppose DWR's proposal at the PUC.

Thanks.  Just a few questions for Carol and Ken:

1. Will there still be a MAC trigger and if so, will it remain at the parent 
level?

2. I am assuming that we still want to receive Holdings"" financials.

3. Sounds like what we want AK Steel to say is that  it will remain as the 
only subsidiary of Holdings.  Is that the concept that you want them to 
covenant about in the ISDA?  I would suggest doing it as a covenant so that 
it would lead to an Event of Default if it is violated.  Does anyone have any

Jeff:

Thanks again for all of your time and consideration with respect to our con=
sideration of Norm Pedersen to join our Firm in Los Angeles.  I just wanted=
 to let you know that we decided it probably did not make sense to pursue t=
hings further with Norm.  After drilling down even further, it just seemed =
like we were going to run into major conflict problems down the road based =
upon the CA regulatory proceedings that likely are going to arise and the n=
ature of Norm's historical client base.  It also would not have been fair t=
o Norm to have him join the Firm and then be conflicted out of work that he=
 had planned to pursue at the Firm.  I can't tell you how much I appreciate=
 your candor as well as your open-mindedness in helping me evaluate the sit=
uation.  I really felt bad bothering you with this, but I knew you would ha=
ve the best insights into the likely direction of the regulatory proceeding=
s in CA and I wanted to make sure that I was being fair in evaluating Norm'=
s situation and in a position to make a decision based on all of the releva=
nt facts.  I also want to emphasize emphatically (if it is possible to use =
those words together!) that I do not want you to think or feel that you ""ni=
xed"" Norm or anything along those lines; indeed, I feel quite the opposite.=
  In addition, from the outset, after first talking to Norm and getting a s=
ense for the types of business he has been handling and the issues he has b=
een pursuing on behalf of his clients, I had felt it was really a non-start=
er since the last thing I wanted to do was to have LeBoeuf on the other sid=
e from Enron in important regulatory proceedings for the company.  It is on=
e thing to receive a waiver to represent another company in a negotiated co=
mmercial transaction in which Enron is relying on another law firm, but I c=
ould not see us pressing a regulatory agenda directly adverse to Enron's in=
terests in a proceeding in which Enron was a major participant and which we=
 knew going into the proceedings at the start that our representation would=
 be adverse to Enron.

As Rick may have told you, there have been some situations where we have be=
en adverse to the Company or at least representing clients that did not see=
 ""eye to eye"" with Enron on all of the issues.  These generally have been s=
ituations involving historical client relationships that go back decades wh=
ere Enron has itself been using Bracewell, for example, and Rick has been i=
ncredibly gracious and understanding in not conflicting us out of those pro=
ceedings.  Nonetheless, I am trying to do whatever I can to try to eliminat=
e or reduce the number of those situations on a going forward basis, althou=
gh I know I will not be able to eliminate all of them in light of the size =
of our Firm and the diverse nature of its client base.

Jeff, I will follow up with you personally, but I just wanted to drop you a=
 quick note to thank you for the time and thought you devoted to this.   I'=
m sure we will be speaking soon on some CA regulatory matter or the other.

Hi Sara,

How are you going - did you have a good Thanksgiving?  Coincidentally 
Thursday was also a holiday here - we were celebrating Respect for the Aged 
Day though.

Actually, Sara, I was wondering how we are going in getting some drafting 
together for the credit provisions discussed recently with John Suttle and 
Jonathan Whitehead.

Thanks and sorry for the trouble.

Jane:

If you have time in the morning (Nov. 9 Tokyo), I would like to discuss ENA's 
view of the CSA/Schedule relationship.  In a nutshell, we provide that a 
ratings downgrade is an Additional Event of Default in the Schedule (normally 
a MAC in the CSA).  John's preferance, of course, would be a unilateral event 
triggering an IBJ default (which I am sure would be difficult to negotiate).

I am not certain of the time difference but perhaps you could call me at the 
office after 4 pm (Nov.8 in Houston) and I could then conference in John.  
Alternatively, please feel free to contact me at home (after 7 pm Houston 
time on Nov. 8) at 713-664-3207.

I look forward to hearing from you.  Regards.  Sara

		 Subject: IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT - 1. Credit matrix and 2. Threshold 
amount 

Dear John,

Jonathan and I met with IBJ today to try and push our negotiations through to 
the end.  They are still unwilling to do a CSA with us but very significantly 
their back / mid office is currently looking at getting systems support in 
place which would permit them to do a CSA with us in due course.  They 
acknowledged to us of their own volition that the market trend is towards 
CSAs even in transactions where the counter party is not a bank.  They did 
say though that it would be a few months before they would be set up to do 
so. Pls note that they did not agree to do a CSA with us as soon as they are 
set up to do so but they now know we will come knocking at some stage to ask 
them to do it so I think we have gone as far as we can on this for now.

We will therefore move forward on the credit matrix in the meantime, if you 
are still willing to do so.  The bank has a credit rating of A, so I guess 
this means US$15 million credit limit.  

On the assumption that it is possible to draft these terms into a contract 
without a full CSA, I wonder who is best to do this drafting.  I should be 
able to do the negotiations but I am not sure that I am able to do the 
drafting .... Alan, do you have any suggestions?     

Most of the other issues are sorted now but they still want to change the 
""Threshold Amount"" definition to US$10 million.  Is there any flexibility on 
this?

Thanks.

Jane McBride

		 Subject: Re: Fw: IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT

Jonathan,

One thing we might be able to propose is a ""Credit Matrix"" which prescribes a 
Credit Line under which each counterparty can transact - with collateral 
rights and collateral thresholds tied to the credit rating of each 
counterparty.  We have used credit matrixes in several contracts here and 
they are appealing in that there are no Material Adverse Change (MAC) 
clauses.  This is appealing to the counterparty in that we cannot 
automatically drop their collateral threshold to zero when a MAC occurs.  We 
are comfortable because as the counterparty's credit quality deteriorates, 
the amount of exposure to which we are subject decreases.  I would propose to 
IBJ something like the following in lieu of a full CSA.  Jane and John - is 
it possible to draft these collateral/credit terms into the contract without 
using a full CSA?  (I think every matrix I have used here has been part of a 
CSA).

Rating (S&P)     Credit Line
AA or above    $20MM
BBB+ to AA-    $15MM
BBB     $10MM
BBB-     $7MM
BB- to BB+    $5MM
Below BB-    $1MM

These terms are subject to negotiation.  Once again, the matrix removes MAC 
clauses and the stress counterparties associate with such, but effectively 
reduces the potential exposure we have (or THEY have) to a counterparty with 
diminishing credit quality.

What do you all think?

John

Sorry, Pressed send too early:

John, Have had a conversation with IBJ re the CSA, and they have asked us to 
consider proposing a solution that does not involve a CSA. I propose to meet 
with them again to try and explore why, but I would like to be prepared to 
offer them a solution whereby we don't enter into a CSA, and we would limit 
the types of trades that we could enter into with IBJ. My feeling is that we 
would be unlikely to enter into any long term transactions (over 2 years) at 
this stage anyway, and would prefer to get the relationship going, as I am 
not sure they are going to budge on this issue yet. They appear to be quite 
willing to discuss all the other points. We can always press for a 
renegotiation at a later stage if we do want to enter into longer term deals. 
I also want to keep the loan facility completely separate.

What are your thoughts on this, and what limitations would you want to put on 
trades if we do not have a CSA?

Thanks,
Jonathan

John-

During our last meeting with IBJ, we pushed hard for the implementation of 
the CSA.  I believe that they have the systems capability to handle the 
requisite activities relating to the CSA, as we understand that they utilize 
same with certain financial institution counterparties.  We expressed our 
view on these matters and also raised other issues that we had discussed in 
our recent conference call.  

IBJ informed us that they have never entered into a CSA with a non-financial 
institution counterparty and my response was that Enron can then be the 
first.  We requested that they raise this issue with their respective 
superiors.  As you know, their response to our discussions relating to this 
issue was ""In terms of CSA, as we are not ready for running collateral 
operations, we still do not prefer to use the CSA.""  The legitimacy of this 
statement is certainly debatable and the underlying reason may actually be 
something entirely different, including the possibility that they merely do 
not want to enter into a CSA with a non-financial institution.  

We will continue to attempt to persuade IBJ to enter into the CSA with Enron, 
however it is uncertain if this is achievable.

Subject:  Intergen - Escrow

I spoke with Mary Perkins in Treasury.  She indicated that we are currently
working with Chase Bank and City Bank for our third party escrow
Agreements.  Mary will forward Kay and I electronic copies of both of their
standard agreements.  The timeline for a standard agreement is at least 3
days and increases with the level of complexity of the Escrow Agreement's
terms & conditions.  The cost for either bank to set-up and administer the
escrow would be approximately $5-$10K, with additional cost if the
Agreement was overly complex.

Kay:  Call me to discuss our proposed Escrow Agreement T&C's and how a
draft form of this Agreement should be best incorporated into the
transaction documents.  At a minimum, we should attach it as a sample form
and have the Letter Agreement(s) contain ""substantially in conformance
with"" language.

Subject: physical option - proposals, term sheets, pricing


Group - we need to address the due diligence for executing the "" first "" 
physical option transactions in Brasil and for Direct Sales ( and Wholesale 
).  The initial industrial candidates are: 

Owens Corning ( 1.6MWs firm ). 1 site,  peaking unit.  break-even R$182/MW - 
5 year term
Carbocloro ( 10 MWs firm ). 1 site 3rd part re-sale(Copel) , monthly call 
option. supplanting product sales, estimate minimum incentive strike R$ 
125/MW  - 3 or 4 year term,  
O Globo. (1-3MWs) 2 sites, peaking units.  awaiting summary terms and 
conditions. 
White Martins (10-15MWs ).   8 sites (MG), intersite flexibility to adjust 
product between sites and maximize energy re-sale.  3rd party re-sale 
(Cemig). short-term capacity basis indutrial demand for gases short-term 
variable price - 2 or 3 year

In all four cases, Enron is buying the right to buy power and all 3 are 
executable in Q2/Q3.  We are expecting (hoping) to transact paying no premium 
- with the focus on the strike price itself being the profitability incentive 
to the customer.  However, we'll need to guage our pricing ability ( and 
appetite from a book and risk control point of view ) for option length and 
the forward curve, not to mention getting the terms and conditions into 
reasonably standardized and legally binding contracts.  

Wholesale. Am including Wholesale on the wire given both the synergies on 
contracting and pricing and given the significant potential ( benefit and 
opportunity to Enron's regional trading effort ) to launch the physical and 
financial option product line into the commercial Wholesale effort.  

Note:  Particularly to put options - how many LDCs would we expect to charge 
us anything for our right to sell them power at R$30 or R$40/MWh ( or have 
charged us  3-5 months ago for the right to sell closer to R$50-60.  

We're having first sit down with Remi and Sami this afternoon, Wed Apr 19; 
please shoot any/all additional inputs, insights.

the conference as speakers because of your roles in developing the Master

appreciate your comments.  Not all the issues need to be part of the oral 
presentation, but could be included in the written handouts.

Please review the program to see which issues you might want to address.  Let 
me know if you are interested in being on the program, are available, or have 
someone else to recommend as a speaker.  As co-chairs of the working group, 
it seems logical to make Patti and Dave moderators. for the main sessions on 
the contract.  I've filled in some other potential speakers.  Also, we were 
thinking of having speakers on managing trading floor operations and credit 
ratings for power marketers.  Any suggestions there would be welcome.  If 
need be, we can set up a conference call to discuss working out the rest of 
the presenters for the program.

Subject: RE: FW: Comments to Turbine Purchase Documents


Chris and Ben:

Since Kay is tied up on a 3:00 conference call, she asked me to summarize
the issues raised by Marguerite's latest mark-ups.  The issues are as
follows:

1. In Section 6(h) regarding the Change Order, Marguerite has added a rider
pursuant to which ENA would be required ""to cause the Original Purchaser
and/or the Agent to use commercially reasonable efforts to afford NorSub (or
its agent or representative), upon request of NorSub, such opportunity or
opportunities to discuss with GE (or to consult with GE concerning) such
matters pertaining to the Turbines and/or the Original Turbine Contract as
NorSub desires to discuss with GE (or to consult with GE concerning) and
which GE is obligated under the Original Turbine Contract to discuss with
(or concerning which GE is obligated under the Original Turbine Contract to
consult with) the Purchaser and/or Agent thereunder; provided, however, that
each of ENA, the Original Purchaser and the Agent shall have the right to be
present at, and to participate in, each such discussion (or consultation.""
According to Jerry DeBerry, Michael Young raised this concept with Ben, and
Ben accepted it in principle.  Please confirm if you are okay with this
rider going into the Letter Agreement.

2.  In Section 8(a), Marguerite has added a clause whereby ENA agrees to be
responsible for, and to pay GE when due, and to hold the LLC and NorSub
harmless from any damages or indemnification payments which become due and
payable to GE on and after the Closing Date as a result of any event
occurring, or any circumstance arising, prior to the Closing Date.  Since
this provision effectively shifts the Change Order risk onto ENA, Kay
suggests that we only accept the provision if a reciprocal provision is
included that allows ENA to terminate the agreement as a result of any event
or circumstance that increases the Purchase Amount.  Do you agree?

3.  Finally, with respect to the LLC Agreement, NorthWestern would like to
be able to exercise its call rights with relative freedom while forcing ENA
to wait until Takeover or 12/31/02 before being able to exercise its put
rights.  Neither Jerry nor Marguerite understands why ENA cares when
NorthWestern takes ENA out.

Jerry and Marguerite were working on scheduling a conference call for
sometime tomorrow, so I will send you an e-mail confirming the details as
soon as I hear back from them.

Best regards,

Marisa

We (Enron and outside counsel) have not received any documents either faxed
or via e-mail as of Tuesday morning.  Once we receive the documents, we
would like time to review the comments before we engage in a conference
call.  Please either resend the documents to Kay Mann, John Keffer and
myself.

Regards,

Chris

Subject: Comments to Turbine Purchase Documents



We have forwarded to you via facsimile our comments to the Letter Agreement
and the LLC Agreement. The majority of our comments, as you will note, are
intended to clarify the understanding of the parties with respect to the
various matters set forth in such documents and are not intended to ""change
the deal"". Except that, upon the advise of our tax counsel, we have
adjusted the amounts of the promissory notes to be issued in connection
with the transaction in order to maximize the LLC's basis in the Turbines.
We believe this is consistent with your initial draft of the Letter
Agreement.


Also, please note that we have included additional language in Section 6 of
the Letter Agreement which provides NorthWestern with the opportunity to
consult with GE on matters relating to the Turbines. This reflects our
understanding of an agreement that had been reached among the parties.


With respect to the LLC Agreement, we would like to discuss with you the
following: (i) the timing of the exercise of the Call Right and (ii) the
intent of your proposed language in Section 7 relating to the rights of
each Member to act in its own best interests with respect to the Call and
Put Rights.  To that end, we propose scheduling a conference call on
Tuesday afternoon, April 11, 2001.  Please contact me as soon as possible
with a time that is convenient for your team.


We look forward to hearing from you.


Note: We will forward to you shortly, revised drafts of the documents for
which we have drafting responsibility.

USA: Analysts still bullish on Enron broadband unit prospects. 
By C. Bryson Hull 
  
03/15/2001 
Reuters English News Service 
(C) Reuters Limited 2001. 
HOUSTON, March 15 (Reuters) - Wall Street took a hard look at Enron Corp.'s 
content delivery plans this week after it ended its video-on-demand deal with 
Blockbuster Inc. , but remained largely unfazed by the failure of the 
flagship deal, analysts said on Thursday.
On balance, most analysts viewed the busted 20-year exclusive agreement as 
disappointing, but by no means a fatal blow to Enron Broadband Services' 
(EBS) budding content delivery segment. 
Most reiterated buy or strong buy ratings for the Houston company and 
maintained bullish earnings targets for the Enron Broadband Services division.
But all are awaiting an indication of how Enron will reconfigure the content 
delivery initiative.
""I think Blockbuster represented kind of an anchor tenant for the broadband 
business, so they have lost a contract that was important,"" said Jeff 
Dietert, an analyst with Houston investment house Simmons and Co.
Now EBS will have to pursue smaller contracts to make up the loss, which 
could mean a longer road to create as big a book of business, Dietert said.
EBS executives have said they expect to have $1 billion in total contracted 
business by the end of 2001.
CHASING MORE CONTRACTS TO FILL VOID
EBS Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Rice on Friday said his 
division is already pursuing deals with content providers to send on-demand 
games, movies, music and television over the Enron network.
UBS Warburg analyst Ronald Barone, in a research note released Monday, said 
he still believes Enron will hit the $1 billion mark in 2001.
""Though this announcement is clearly a disappointment we have a great deal of 
confidence in the judgment of Enron's senior management and of the upside 
associated with this business,"" Barone wrote.
His report reiterated a strong buy recommendation and 12-month stock price 
target of $102 a share, with EBS accounting for $25 of that.
One analyst remained skeptical of the content delivery plans.
""Where they go from here is one of things they have to tell the market in a 
convincing fashion,"" said Commerzbank Securities analyst Andre Meade, who 
raised Enron to accumulate from hold on Thursday.
But he also cut earnings targets for the EBS segment to $8.40/share because 
of the failed Blockbuster deal.
Heady cash-flow projections figured heavily in Enron's guidance for 2001, 
which called for a stock price of $126, of which EBS would account for $40, 
Meade said.
Meade, whose company initiated coverage on Enron in late May 2000, had been 
alone among Enron analysts in keeping a hold rating on the stock.
Merrill Lynch analyst Donato Eassey on Monday released a note reiterating his 
buy recommendation with a $99/share price target.
""While the separation from such a high-profile name is disappointing, we do 
not view this as negative,"" Eassey wrote. ""This could in fact actually 
accelerate Enron's content delivery strategy.""
Eassey pointed out that Enron and Blockbuster's trial in Seattle, Salt Lake 
City, New York and Portland, Ore., proved Enron can deliver movies on demand.
That gives them a track record to show to potential customers like movie 
studios and other entertainment concerns that want to provide content 
directly through their Web sites, he said.
Enron's stock closed on Thursday at $66.53, up $3.78, compared with its 
52-week range of $59.99 to $90.5626.

After enron is registered (I think it's a free registration), you provide
the following information to the enron official so he/she will send it to nsf.
NSF will assign you a password for future access to electronic submission

		 Subject: SBX 9 (Elimination of Standby Charges)

The Distributed Energy Resources industry won a major battle yesterday.  The 
California Senate Energy and Utilities Committee passed on a 7-0 bipartisan 
vote, Sen. Morrow's (and while her name wasn't on this bill, it was as much 
Sen. Alpert's) bill on eliminating any tariff that discriminates against 
DER.  SBX 9 was derived from the omnibus DER bill SBX 35 which is still alive 
and contains many important provisions fro removing additional barriers.  
Yesterday's vote represents a major win because even if the bill ultimately 
does not get enacted, a very important statement has been made by the 
committee.  I'm sure the CPUC will take notice in their proceedings.
 
The DER community owes much thanks to Sen.'s Morrow and Alpert, and the 
Utilities Committee Members and their staffs:
Sen. Bowen (Chair)
Sen. Alarcon
Sen. Battin
Sen. Dunn
Sen. Murray
Sen. Poochigian
Sen. Sher
Sen. Speier
Sen. Vasconcellos
Sen. Vincent
 
Also much thanks to everyone who worked incredibly hard and diligently on 
this effort.  From the business, consumer advocacy, environmental, 
government, manufacturing, and real estate communities.
 
Here are the highlights of yesterday's actions:
 
1. For IOU's- No discriminatory tariffs for new DER installed between May 1, 
2000 and June 1, 2003 if DER is in combined heat and power mode.  If you have 
a peaking unit with gen only, then you have until  July 1 2001, to get it 
installed.  
2. DER installed within the window gets the exemption until June 1, 2011.
3. The maximum capacity of the DER is 5 MW in aggregate per site.
4. The DER must have emissions levels of 9 PPM or better until the ARB 
established new guidelines and standards, expected late this year or early 
next year.
5. Customers with DER are still required to pay interconnection, public 
purpose charges, and obligations incurred under the Dept. of Water Resources 
energy purchases program.
6. The CPUC shall require the electrical corporations to include non-utility 
owned DER in its planning process.
7. The CPUC is required to establish a firewall so that in the event that the 
implementation of DER results in net costs to the system, those costs stay 
within the customer class.
8. The CPUC shall require the utilities to establish new rates for DER that 
are non-discriminatory and take into account the benefits as well as the 
costs.
9. Muni's are required to review their tariffs for barriers to entry and hold 
public meetings to solicit comment for recommended changes.
Now we have momentum, but there is still a tremendous amount of work to do on 
the Assembly side and with Governor's office.  We need the continued 
(increased) support of all of you as we move this forward.

"Thanks in advance for agreeing to speak at the Global Operations Controller 
Forum.  I know that we are catching you before a tee time on Monday, so I 
especially appreciate your joining us to kick off the event that morning.  
Dress for the forum is casual, so feel free to do the same.  There will be 
approximately 30 Enron business controllers present at the meeting.  All have 
responsibility for mid and back office operations for the following Enron 
entities:  Enron North America, Enron Europe, Enron South America, Enron 
Global Markets, Enron Industrial Markets, Enron Broadband Services and Enron 
Energy Services.  Attendees will be here from Houston, Calgary, Tokyo, 
Sydney, London and New York (metals business).   

Attached for your reference is the agenda. There may be some slight changes 
before the forum begins, but this will give you a good idea of the topics to 
be covered and the other speakers who will address the group.  


You are scheduled to address the group as follows:

Date:  Monday, October 23, 2000
Time:  8:00 am
  (breakfast will be served at 7:30 and you are invited to join us)
Place:  The Warwick Hotel
  The Versailles Room - 12th Floor 
  5701 Main Street
  Houston,  TX  77005

With a small group, your talk can be informal and you do not need to prepare 
slides (unless you would like to do so).  Q&A afterwards would be great.  Key 
speaking points that would enforce the value of this conference for this 
group would be:

recognition of a job well done in supporting explosive business growth in 
2000 
your support for global standards for operational controls for trading 
activities
your recognition of the value of operational professionals in the 
organization to ensure integrity of mid and back office functions  
your challenge to the group to strive for best in class processes and 
controls as Enron's growth as a trading organization continues

Let me know if you have any questions and thanks again for joining us.

FERC To Examine Alleged Market Manipulation By Calif ISO=20
Updated: Friday, September 21, 2001 04:53 PM ET By Jason Leopold Of DOW JON=
ES NEWSWIRES=20
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Federal energy regulators may investigate whether =
the operator of California's wholesale electricity market has been manipula=
ting its power-purchasing practices to reduce the costs of power the state =
purchased under long-term contracts, according to documents obtained Friday=
 by Dow Jones Newswires Friday.=20
At issue is whether the California Independent System Operator has violated=
 its own market rules by purchasing expensive power secured by the state un=
der contracts rather than cheaper power available in the spot market. The s=
tate's need to sell off surplus power secured under those contracts has pro=
ven embarrassing for Gov. Gray Davis, who signed $43 billion in deals to he=
ad off a summer of spiking prices and blackouts that never materialized.=20
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will hold a meeting in California =
Monday to address generators' complaints. The energy companies say that the=
 California ISO's purchasing decisions are difficult to comprehend and out =
of line with the market, according to a letter sent by Andrea Wolfman, lead=
 FERC counsel for market oversight and enforcement.=20
The letter was sent to the ISO, the California Department of Water Resource=
s - which has been buying power in lieu of the state's struggling utilities=
 since mid-January - and several generators, all of which were to attend th=
e meeting.=20
""Recently we have become concerned that the scheduling and dispatch procedu=
res of the California ISO, as they have had to change in the last nine mont=
hs, are not well understood or are not well suited to the current market st=
ructure,"" Wolfman said in her letter. ""The purpose of the meeting is to dev=
elop agreement between the ISO and those that participate in the scheduling=
 and dispatch (generators, utilities, CDWR) on appropriate practices and pr=
ocedures.""=20
ISO Procedures Need Explaining -FERC=20
The ISO's main responsibility is keeping power supply and demand in balance=
 on the state's electrical grid. As part of that job, the ISO determines wh=
ich power plants to call into service and which suppliers to buy power from=
.=20
If the ISO can't explain how it makes its decisions, FERC may conduct an au=
dit of the organization and investigate the possibility it has manipulated =
the market, Wolfman's office said.=20
""As discussed, FERC may schedule a technical conference and operational aud=
it of CAISO,"" a second letter from FERC's market oversight and enforcement =
division states. ""This unprecedented examination of CAISO operations could =
lead to the belief that complaints by generators of market manipulation and=
 other practices by the ISO should be investigated.""=20
The ISO's operating rules generally call for it to purchase the cheapest po=
wer first.=20
""The information that (generators) have provided all leads to a theory that=
 the CAISO is manipulating the market in order to purchase surplus DWR powe=
r at high prices and protect Gov. Davis from political embarrassment,"" the =
second letter says.=20
The ISO has said only that the market isn't operating as intended, and decl=
ined to answer other questions about the allegations or discuss Monday's me=
eting.=20

nexpensive power in the ISO's spot market only to find weeks later that the=
 price was much higher. That's because, according to the allegations, the I=
SO is letting DWR supply expensive power into the market as ""out-of-market""=
 purchases that aren't averaged into the real-time prices that ISO market p=
articipants see.=20
DWR continues to buy out-of-market power regularly at the ISO's request, DW=
R operations chief Pete Garris has said, but those purchases are being made=
 in the spot market and are never being satisfied by power from DWR's long-=
term contracts.=20
The out-of-market purchases appear to be expensive, however. According to t=
he ISO's August market report, the average out-of-market price for peak hou=
rs was $55.90 a megawatt-hour, compared with $26.49/MWh on the ISO computer=
ized market. Brokered prices of western electricity have been lower than th=
e out-of-market prices for months.=20
None of the companies mentioned was willing to comment on the record.=20
The meeting is scheduled to be held at the ISO's headquarters in Folsom, Ca=
lif., and representatives from power producers, utilities and the state are=
 expected to attend. FERC will serve as facilitator, Wolfman said. The meet=
ing isn't open to the public.=20
The meeting will begin with a presentation by the ISO on its practices and =
operational procedures, followed by adjustments that may be needed to impro=
ve the market.=20
""The objective is to develop a written set of procedures that is agreed to =
by all the market participants and that is consistent with good utility pra=
ctices,"" Wolfman said in the letter.=20

1) do the capital cost of linears (gas, transmission and system upgrades)
include tax gross ups relating thereto?

2) Is the cost of backup power (for startup and station service) included in
the variable O&M estimate, or is it included in one of the fixed charges.
Please tell us where it is and how much it is expected to be annually?

"Russell:
Based on my review of the 6/23 draft of ISDA Schedule here are my credit 
questions:

1. There is no Credit Support Provider for Equitable.  Should there be?

2. What should the cross default thresholds be and who should they apply to?

3. Are you satisfied with the Additional Termination Event?    I'm assuming 
that in clause (i) of the definition of Debt Coverage Amount, it makes sense 
to take ""future"" revenues from the preceding year and subtract from it asset 
sales made during the current year?  How will we know what assets sales are 
made?  Will the future net revenue calculation be shown on the reserve report 
that we receive annually?  When will this calculation be done?  Are you 
satisfied with their definition of Internal and External debt?

4. In Part 3(a), looks like we would only receive an annual reserve report.  
Is that sufficient?  When should we get it?  Alos, whose financials do you 
want to receive?

5. In Part 5(c) - Setoff, I'll just note that this only applies to amounts 
due and owing between the parties and does not include ""affiliates"".  

6. In Part 5(f)- Assignment,  we need to decide what conditions precedent we 
want to apply to the limited partnership entity that they assign it to given 
the fact that once assigned, we will have no recourse to the partners, even 
the GP.  For example, should the LP have a minimum asset value at the time of 
the transfer?  It is not clear to me what assets this LP would own at the 
time of the transfer and I'm assuming that we would want it to meet some 
minimum credit criteria prior to such transfer.  In addition, are you 
satisfied with the debt and asset sale limitations?  On asset sales, I think 
that they need an annual limit as it is not clear to me how the $2,000,000 
limit currently works.  Alos, I think that all of these limitations in 
Section (f) should either be additional Events of Default or Additional 
termination Events.

Please call when ready to discuss.

Further to our telephone discussion today with Jason Peters who I couldn't

normally has a paragraph (d))seems  to be only found in the CBA Agreements. 
Its purpose is a little uncertain. If the Broker was holding a Client's money 
then by law he must account for it. 

The reason why there ARN Ambro may be reluctant to accept the clause is 
because the instances it addresses would probably fall within the definition 
of an ""undesirable market event"" under the SFE rules. This would trigger 
action by the Board of SFE to sort out the mess. It may uncertain as to how 
these contractual would fit in     "

Hello!
 
Just a friendly reminder that tomorrow all   presentations are due as I will be in and out of the office for the rest of the  week at the Asset and Liability Management conference.  
 
If your presentations are not ready, for whatever  reason, please send me an email to notify me and I will send you a headcount as  to how many copies of your presentations to print.  You will need to take  them to the training course yourself.  
 
Please remember that you will need to bring your  own laptops as we do not provide them.  Spyros, I believe you are to  inquire with Peter to see if you can use his.  
 
Also, I am under the impression that the  presentations submitted for the London training course, will be the same ones to  be used in the New York and Houston Financial Mathematics training  courses.  Please correct me if I am wrong and let me know by when you will  have presentations ready for those particular courses in those  locations.
 
Should you have any questions or comments, please  feel free to contact me.
 
All the best and I look forward to meeting you  soon.

"This should give LEGC something to shoot at - 

I love the statment ""In fact, a good case can be made that, given market 
conditions, consumers would have saved as much or more under effective 
regulation, without exposing them to price spike risk"".  Isn't this the crux 
of the argument.

Subject: Consumer Group Reports Issued


On March 19th, the Foundation for Taxpayer & Consumer Rights published a 
report in it's Bailout Watch newsletter (Special Report: The Manufactured 
Energy Crisis) concluding that California's energy crisis has been 
manufactured by ""energy firms.""  A copy of the report is attached and is also 
available on the organization's website at www.consumerwatchdog.org.

Today, the Consumer Federation of America released a report (Behind the 
Headlines of Electricity Restructuring: A Story of Green, Irresponsibility 
and Mismanagement of a Vital Service in a Vulnerable Market) asking 
policymakers to ""rethink"" the move toward retail electric competition.  A 
copy of the report is available at their website at www.consumerfed.org or 
www.consumerfed.org/calmkt.pdf.  Copies of the press release and the report 
are also attached.

"Mark:

Per our conversation, attached is a short ""recap"" of the companies and amounts involved.

With respect to prime brokerage accounts, the following approximate cash balances are held by Bear Stearns & Co. (""Bear"") in accounts for the following companies:

Enron North America Corp.	$159,022		[filing debtor]

ECT Investments, Inc.		$3,923,970.84		[has not filed]

Enron Credit Inc.		$10,500,000		[has not filed]

I understand that one of our U.K. companies, Enron Credit Limited, has been in touch with one of your employees with respect to the return of the Enron Credit Inc. cash and was told that Bear wished to offset that amount against the amount owed by Enron Credit Limited to Bear under OTC trades, approx. $1,500,000, for a net balance of approx. $9,000,000.

ECT Investments Inc. sent a demand letter to you via facsimile on November 30, 2001 requesting return of its cash balance.  I do not believe that ECT Investments, Inc.has any OTC trades with Bear but I will need to verify.

We would like to resolve the return of cash issues.  Please feel free to contact me.

Thanks for your assistance.

Subject: Ledford-Titan Option to Purchase

Kay:  
   Per my voicemail, at the request of the Ledfords, Fred and Rusty
have agreed to limit the easement area in the Option for Purchase and Grant
of Easement between the Ledfords and Titan Development to a 100' area
adjacent to the railroad right-of-way.  The following reflects that
modification to the third ""whereas"" in the Ledford-Titan Option incorporated
this morning following my conversations with Fred and Rusty.  
   WHEREAS, Optionors desire to grant to Optionee, and Optionee desires
to obtain from Optionors, an option for the grant of an easement in, over
and within the strip of land 100' wide in Parcel 2 (defined below) which is
immediately adjacent to and east of the railroad right-of-way for the
installation of drain tiles, pipelines, and other utility uses across other
property owned by Optionors (""Parcel 2""), as more particularly described in
Exhibit B attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference (the
""Easement""); 

Additionally, I have received a fax copy of the executed Fehr agreement. I
am stopping by their attorney's office today to pick up the originals and to
put together the joint counterpart signatures.  I am also meeting with the
Ledford's attorney this afternoon and hope to finalize the execution of that
Option as well.  I will fax you the fully executed copies tomorrow morning
when I return to the office and the original versions will follow by fed ex.

Kay,

Thanks for your call the other night.  I was at the hospital.  Jackie is
doing ok so far but today she has a big operation to put a tube in her chest
- a permanent replacement for the IV in her hand that the doctors say kids
like better since they don't see it under their shirts and get used to it
after a week or two.  75% chance to live at this point and if all goes as
planned there will be no need for a bone marrow transplant but she will need
blood transfusions...we don't need to donate at all as HK as a supply of
blood already...no visitors to her room except me, vicky, michelle, and
michelle's boyfriend...mom may have told you by now she has ALL Type B and I
got the info on Type B that you downloaded from the web - thanks - i am
still reading through all of the materials from the doctor - i do have alot
of questions - if you have a friend at MD Anderson i need to find out what
the ""German Method"" of treatment for leukemia is and whether it's  just as
good as the american method, and i also want to find out whether chinese
people can have the same treatment as westerners...i would think that at md
anderson they would have experience treating both chinese and western
patients so they should know if the treatments are normally the same or
not...i don't know if this hospital has ever had a western leukemia patient
before...thanks again.
Robert

From a commercial perspective, I don't have a problem leaving out the

 The form of the Guaranty is okay.  Please have them correct the name ""Enron

"To tell you the truth, this stuff is difficult for me to retain, so I could 
be completely off base. I would like to have Herman walk through it again.

Subject: Re: VEPCO/FYI  

It makes one wonder whether one can be in any position in these deals and not 
be in a lease.  Maybe we should ask Herman to describe one.  I was under the 
assumption that if the PPA is not plant specific, there is less of a concern 
on who the EPC contractor is.  I also thought the O&M affiliate was fatal 
even if we sold down the equity.  Have I missed the question again?

"Michael Brown,

Do you have the standard offer service agreement?  It isn't in Stuart's file, 
and it is referenced as being entered into at the same time as the PPSA.  We 
need to see how these two agreements fit together.  

Has NIMO given the bidders access to the contracts listed in the schedules?  
We especially need to see the ones that they can assign to Enron (PSEG and 
NRG). 

Given the size of the transaction I think we should have Klauberg (or another 
New York lawyer) take a look at it. It is an interesting deal.

Email

Malicious Code (Virus) Screening
In addition to the Enron requirement for email attachments (received and 
sent) to be screened for malicious code (viruses, Trojan Horses, etc.), users 
of Enron information resources are required to detach email attachments that 
are received on to their hard drive for local virus screening purposes. 

All executables (*.bat, *exe, *.com) files should never be launched from 
email without first consulting with IT. 

Virus Alerts
The Internet is constantly being flooded with information about computer 
viruses and Trojan Horses. However, within among real virus notices are 
computer virus hoaxes. While these hoaxes do not infect systems, they are 
still time consuming and costly to handle. It only wastes bandwidth and 
un-necessarily alarms other computer users.

Please, do not perpetuate unconfirmed warnings about viruses and Trojan 
Horses. If you receive an un-validated warning, don't pass it to all your 
friends, pass it to your IT computer security manager to validate first.

"As discussed in our 3-Rivers/King Ranch meeting, I have set up purchases from 
the liquids group and the other 3rd parties at HGPL mtr 0012.  Due to 
bridgebacks, I had to create new deal numbers for the days prior to 2/16/99.  
(I went back to Dec 1999, in case it is needed.)  Please see the deal #s 
below.

Teco  113858 &169759
HPLR Liquids  114099 & 169765   (existing deal to cover excess residue)
Swift  93779 & 169761
ERAC  138094 & 169760
Tejones 133173 & 169762


Mandy - I understand that you will be setting up the buy and sale with HPLR 
Liquids to cover the transport on HGPL.

Let me know if you have any questions.

"I had assumed we were going to have a separate PA for the Auction-only 
counterparties.  The PA contains an unfortunate reference to the ETA which 
will need to change if they will only be accepting the Auction-only agreement.

Subject: New PA form

Mark/Justin,

Attached is a copy of the Australian PA. It includes the addition of an 
Address for Service.

Do you think we should incorporate this in our other PA's as well?

I realise that in many instances we are already doing business with the 
relevant company - and the same or similar information might be included on 
the Registration form (where completed) - but are you concerned about 
ambiguity in the event that no Registration form is completed?

Also: We will need to have some way to distinguish PA's which arrive for 
customers who want access to Auctions only. What do you think about adding a 
statement like: ""(Optional): Tick this box if you wish to have access only to 
EnronOnline auctions and not to the main transactions site""  [tick box].

If you wish to proceed with either of the above, we will need to revise all 
PA's and post them on the website.

Thanks,

Dave

I tried again to get comments from Gareth but had no luck.  Let's go ahead 
and print it out and get it signed.  Please be sure to insert Mark S. Muller

Sara,

I'm on someone else's computer - I'm having all sorts of e-mail problems 
today.

The business person on the  EES side to be signing this letter would be Mark 
S. Muller.  He is a Managing Director of EES LLC.

I don't necessarily have a problem with the description of the back-to-back 
obligations, but I'd like to know Gareth's opinion as to whether the language 
is too broad.

"Davis,  This actually sounds frighteningly like my experience at the Big 12 
Game.  However, just because I at one time worked at the Posse doesn't mean 
my character should continue to be called into question.

executing NDAs.  Leslie will serve as in-house legal counsel for EMS while 
Tana will be the Senior Legal Assistant for all documentation such as NDAs.

There are two general forms that ENW uses for NDAs.  The first form is 
bilateral and used when both parties are disclosing confidential business 
information.  The second is unilateral and more clearly and thoroughly 
articulates Enron's interests.  The second form should be used when Enron is 
the only party disclosing confidential information.

When you would like to execute an NDA with an outside party, please contact 
Tana via email (tana.jones@enron.com) and carbon copy myself, providing the 
following information:
 1.  Which form you would like to use
 2.  General description of the confidential information to be shared
 3.  Counterparty's legal name
 4.  Counterparty's address
 5.  Contact name at Counterparty
 6.  How/where to send NDA and appropriate information (fax or email and 
number or address).

		 Subject: CA Supply Realities

Attached is a memo comparing the CEC's forecasted supply and a more realistic 
look at what additional resources might be available this summer.

The bottom line is that:

1.  The CEC significantly underestimates the outages that may occur this 
summer.  They estimate in their 5,000 MW supply deficit for the summer that 
expected outages will be around 3,000MW.  However, November and December saw 
significantly higher outage levels.  (7,265 MWs) The FERC has investigated 
these outages and found no improprieties- just that the plants are overtaxed 
from running at higher than normal capacities.

2.  There are a lot of uncertainties surrounding the 1,244 MWs of projected 
supply from rerating/restarting existing thermal and renewable projects.  It 
is very unclear how much of this will be able to come on line by this summer, 
if at all.  As evidenced by the e-mail I sent out this morning, local 
communities may be very opposed to restarting shut down units.  In addition, 
these units are likely to be uneconomical.

3.  In the existing resource pool, there are roughly 1,430 MWs of peaking or 
other generation units that are running up against their operating hour 
limitations from air quality regulations.  The Governor has ordered the local 
air quality districts to address these restrictions,  We are beginning to 
seem some movement; however, the US EPA has yet to weigh in on these relaxed 
standards.

4.  The distributed generation/back-up generation capacity to make up some of 
the shortfall is still an unknown.  While there has been some relaxing of the 
limitations on run hours for back-up generation at ""essential public 
services"" the increase in DG is expected from ""clean"" sources, not diesel 
emergency generators.

5.  The CEC is doing everything it can to get 50+ MW peaking units on-line by 
this summer.  They are promising a 21-day permit application approval process 
and are offering to pay half of the cost of offsets, for ""clean"" sources of 
generation in critical areas.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need additional information.

"Carol:

Regarding a ""hedge fund meeting"" next week, I have spoken with most of the 
likely participants and everyone is eager to meet next week.  I'll fill you 
in on details in person.  I think the following people should attend:

Fred Lagrasta
Caroline Abramo
Robyn Zivic
Russell Dyk
you 
Brent
me

I believe that we have a mushrooming ""process"" issue.  I also believe that 
the credit group is part of the problem (we should have a separate discussion 
with Paul to discuss potential hedge fund credit issues - maybe there are 
none and maybe our legal choices are unimportant to credit).  My observations 
are that all hedge funds need not be ""last minute"" deals, Caroline can be our 
ally and needs to learn our documents and credit needs to advise legal 
sooner.  I have asked Caroline to prepare a list of all funds she is 
currently working with, has already discussed with Paul or is considering.

Afternoon is best.  Shall I schedule or have you already begun?

I met Maureen yesterday and had a useful discussion on her role within

function of the company, particularly given Maureen's background,  if she 
could be introduced to some of the main traders down at MG.  Unfortunately 
she won't have time to meet with MG unless we can schedule some meetings on 
Monday.

Would you be happy for her to extend her stay here till Monday to allow the 
meetings to take place?

"California's $12.5 Bln Bond Sale May Be Salvaged, Official Says
Sacramento, California, Oct. 10 (Bloomberg) -- California's $12.5 billion bond sale to cover energy costs may win approval if Governor Gray Davis agrees to seek revisions of existing power contracts, a state regulatory official said. 
The bond sale stalled last week when the California Public Utilities Commission voted 4-1 against a plan to repay the state's power costs using utility rates. The commissioners favor another approach, opposed by Davis, that would give them more authority over the state's $43 billion of power contracts. 
Some commissioners ``would probably be amenable to the rate agreement if there was movement on the governor's part to renegotiate those contracts,'' said Geoffrey Brown, who was appointed to the PUC by Davis. ``We're not just sitting around waiting for the sky to fall. There's got to be some give here.'' 
Moody's Investors Service on Friday said California's $31.6 billion of debt may be downgraded for the second time this year, in part because of the delayed bond sale. California's budget deficit in fiscal 2003 may reach $9.3 billion if energy costs aren't repaid, state Treasurer Philip Angelides said. 
The state has spent $10.4 billion since January buying electricity on behalf of PG&E Corp. and Edison International utilities, which are insolvent. 
Davis `Willing to Discuss' 
``It takes two to tango and we are certainly willing to discuss the contracts,'' said Steve Maviglio, the governor's spokesman. 
Davis will consider Brown's offer, ``especially in context'' of any refunds from generators that may be ordered, Maviglio said. State officials claim power generators have charged too much, and are asking federal regulators to order refunds. 
Power generators are ``willing to discuss it, but I wouldn't want anybody to have any false promise or hope that any enormous change will come from this,'' said Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, a group representing power sellers. Any companies willing to talk ``might want something else in return, and who knows what that might be.'' 
The planned bond sale, the largest municipal debt sale in U.S. history, would repay the state's general fund for a $6.1 billion power loan and cover other power costs. The sale has been delayed by the disagreements among state leaders. 
`A Blank Check' 
Under state law, the PUC is required to provide enough revenue from consumer rates to meet the bond payments and cover power contracts. The Department of Water Resources, the state agency buying the power, has sole authority to determine its revenue needs. 
PUC President Loretta Lynch and others said an irrevocable financing order would make it difficult for the state to renegotiate power contracts. They also said the DWR has been given too much authority. In the past, the PUC has set utility rates. 
``It gives a blank check to the DWR for anything that they want to do going forward,'' said California Senate President Pro Tempore John Burton. 
The commissioners favor a plan to back the bonds with a surcharge on utility customers' bills. The proposal would let the PUC review the water department's revenue requirements and require a public hearing on the allocation of costs among the utilities. Davis opposes that plan. 
``It's dead on arrival. It's still going to be vetoed,'' said Maviglio. The governor has until Sunday to sign or veto all the bills sent to him during the last session. 
The new plan would expose the state to breach-of-contract claims, the governor's office said in a statement last week. The state agreed with power generators to pay energy contracts before repaying the bonds. Making a change now ``would eliminate the security on which the power sellers relied'' the governor's office said in the statement. 
Critics of the long-term power contracts say the state's economy will be hurt by above-market costs for years to come. 
No matter which approach the state takes, ``the government ought to try to renegotiate the contracts anyway,'' Burton said. ``And some of the generators have said they're willing to do it.'' "
"I have a conflict at 130. Rose has been reliable at showing up and 
participating, so I suggest that she be included, although it sounds like she 
'll be with John.

		 Subject: Re: GE- Standard Domestic Contract- Need your help

Read your notes re scheduling a call w/ or w/o GE.  From John's and my 
perspective, it seems that we should first have an internal call re the 
consolidation of our assignments from weeks past  into Peter's draft contract 
and then send to GE for their review and follow up call either later this 
week or next.  Steve Swift is OK with this approach.  

At the moment we seem to be knee deep w/GE and Owner on Arcos and suspect 
that 9:30 CST (3:30 London time) will be difficult for us to call in.  
Instead, 1:30 CST would work better for us.  

If this works for the Houston gang could you let us know soonest and we will 
let Mike and Steve know as well.

Would you all be in a posiotion to get together tomorrow morning at 9:30 am 
Houston time to review the issues list and  talk about how we get to the end 
of this process with GE.  We immediately need to start the drafting of the 
Longview turbine contract and I'd like to see if we are close enough to get 
that started.  Scott, today the extension to the Agreement in Principle 
expires and we need to extend.  Can you tee this up with Steve Swift?  Our 
meeting tomorrow will be in lieu of the regularly scheduled GE call.  I'll 
let them know we will call them later this week or we'll talk next Wednesday, 
but I would like to get through whatever we need to in order to get the 
Longview Turbine Contract going.  
I've talked to John Schwartzenburg about this and he is available tomorrow 
morning.

"All:  It appears that this is the group which can best address the 
(derivatives) issues which may arise when Enron Corp. attempts to enter into 
equity swaps/options/forwards based upon Enron Corp. stock.  We have all 
undertaken to provide the group with the following items:

(1)  ""Procedures for Executing/Documenting/Unwinding Enron Corp. Equity 
Derivatives""
       Clint has already circulated a draft proposal.  Comments are invited.

(2)  The transacting party:  ENA (with an Enron Corp. guaranty) or Enron 
Corp.?
       Rex has no preference and credit's initial response was to consolidate 
trading in ENA.  I will revisit this issue with Bill Bradford.

(3)  Enron Corp. equity trading resolution
       Rex and Jim will handle the drafting and logistics.  This will be 
necessary if Enron Corp. is the trading party because the counterparty will 
want to review      (and equity trading requires authorization) AND also 
necessary if ENA is the trading party because equity trading requires 
authorization.

(4)  Standard form of Registration Rights Agreement
       Rex and Jim will handle the drafting.  This can be used as our ""form"" 
for future transactions.

(5)  Enron Corp. ""position paper"" addressing equity derivative parameters, 
preferable methods of settlement, registration rights, etc.
       I have no volunteers.  Maybe Bob Baird needs an assignment.

As you know, there are several outstanding confirms which require immediate 
attention before the foregoing items can be finalized.  Please let me know if 
we can establish a timetable for completion of this project.  Thanks for your 
help.  Sara"

"Judge orders Enron to deliver electricity to universities


Updated: April 11, 2001 - 2:06 p.m. 
SAN FRANCISCO -- Saying that Enron Energy Systems Inc. may be in breach of 
contract, a federal judge Wednesday ordered the Houston company to abide by 
its agreement to sell cheap power to the state's public universities. 

Enron was attempting to get out of delivering power for the final year of a 
four-year deal with the California State University and University of 
California systems. 

Enron, which buys power from producers and sells it on the market, said the 
contract would cost the energy concern $12 million a month because of 
skyrocketing wholesale power prices. 

Enron said the state should free Enron from its obligation and taxpayers 
should pick up the tab. 

""It's our economic interest to provide a service with the least amount of 
dollars we can provide it for,"" Enron attorney A. William Urquhart said. He 
later described the case as being ""all about money. It's all about money."" 

Enron said it would file an emergency appeal to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of 
Appeals in San Francisco to overturn U.S. District Judge Phyllis Hamilton's 
ruling in the suit brought by the state's two university systems. 

Appearing in federal court, state Attorney General Bill Lockyer argued that 
Enron wants out of the contract so it can engage in a ""marketing game"" with 
the universities' promised power and sell it on the open market for 10 times 
more than what the electricity cost Enron. 

He said lawmakers may have ""left the keys in the car"" when they approved 
California's failed energy deregulation scheme that has prompted the energy 
crisis, ""But it is still theft to steal the car."" 

The judge issued a temporary injunction against Enron, forcing it to continue 
providing service as the suit brought by the universities proceeds. When the 
judge issued the order, she also said there is a likelihood Enron will lose 
the suit. 

""I am persuaded, in the end, there is a very strong likelihood of success on 
the breach of contract claim,"" the judge said. 

UC's annual electric bill is about $87 million and its natural gas bill is 
about $26 million. CSU annually pays about $40 million for electricity and 
$20 million for natural gas. 

The case is UC Regents vs. Enron Energy Systems Inc., 01-1006.

""Exotic Options for Interruptible Electricity Supply Contracts"" (February
2000)
 PWP-071 by Rajnish Kamat and Shmuel S. Oren.

This paper presents the design and pricing of financial contracts for the
supply and procurement of interruptible electricity service. The proposed
contracts consist of bundling simple forwards with exotic call options that
have two exercise points with different strike prices. Such options allow
hedging and valuation of supply curtailment risk while explicitly
accounting for the notification lead time before curtailment.
The proposed instruments are priced under the traditional GBM price process
assumption and under the more realistic assumption of a mean reverting
price process with jump diffusion. The latter results employ state of the
art Fourier transforms techniques.

Subject: Re: Southern  RTO  

I met with Andy Dearman and Bill Newman of Southern on Friday.  They talked 
about what is going on with the non-jurisdictional utilities that have signed 
a MOU to develop a RTO.  The group has met a couple of times to discuss the 
process they will use.  Confidentiality agreements have been signed, so no 
details are available, but they have agreed to a voting structure for the 
development.  Southern has about one third of the votes (and 65%of the 
assets) and it takes at least two other parties agreeing with Southern to 
carry a vote.  Southern says they spent a lot of time convincing the other 
parties that Southern was not going to run, or dominate, the process.  After 
that, Southern said the group started to pull together and get organized for 
the development.  

They said everyone in the group appeared to be ready to find ways to make the 
RTO work and resolve the hurdles the non-jurisdictional utilities have been 
expressing with the development of other RTOs.  They said there were some 
rough spots that had to be resolved and they couldn't be sure agreement would 
be reached, but at this point there was a lot of cooperation. 

Andy and Bill wanted to convince me that this was not a delaying tactic by 
Southern and they were doing everything possible to ensure that a complete 
RTO filing could be ready by 12/15/01.  They also said they thought this is 
what Ed Holland wanted to discuss with Steve Kean.  

We talked about how other stakeholders could have input to the development.  
They said that it was too early to make any commitment, but the group had 
started thinking about it and they expected an input process to be available 
by late summer. 
They said Southern was in favor of some process that would provide 
stakeholders the opportunity to look at what was being considered and advise 
the development group as early as possible.  They said they understood the 
difficulty stakeholders had with the approach Southern used in its initial 
filing and wanted to do it different, but they pointed out again that 
Southern could not dictate the process that would be allowed by the group.  
In the meantime, they said if we wanted to provide position papers on any 
part of the RTO development they would make sure the papers were circulated 
in the group or we could continue to hold bilateral discussions with them or 
other members of the development group.

Jim, I still think it would be worthwhile to have a meeting between Ed and 
Steve Kean, and I would include you and invite Andy and Bill to come.  I 
don't think they want to discuss anything technical at this point; they just 
want to convince Enron that the approach Southern is taking provides the 
quickest development of a RTO for the Southern area, and they want any help 
we can give in convincing FERC to let this process run.  

I also think we need to pass on filing a response to Southern's May 15th 
status report, either alone or with Alabama Municipal Electric Authority ( 
Donna, I guess that's who you meant in the memo below, since AEC has signed a 
MOU with Southern?).  I will get in touch with Bob Reilley to find out why we 
haven't heard from EPSA on its filing.  I still think that's the best 
approach.

		 Subject: Southern  supplemental status report

I am attaching the supplemental status report that Southern filed in its 
RT01-77 on June 20.  They have included MOUs with Georgia Transmission Corp, 
Santee Cooper and Alabama Electric Coop to work on development of an RTO.  
These are really general, more of the same of what we've seen from Southern.

Also we had talked  about possible comments on the May 15 Southern filing; 
Coral was working on comments through EPSA.  Nothing has been filed by EPSA 
yet.  

Alabama did file comments on the May 15 status report and they have asked 
that the FERC establish a technical conference to ""publicly air and evaluate 
the alleged governance concerns and the concerns regarding significant 
delay...""  Following a technical conference, they ask for a judge to convene 
a settlement conference at FERC to ""undertake a properly supervised and 
serious development of an RTO for the SE without further wasted time.""

At this point we could consider filing comments in support of the Coop 
comments.

for gathering and processing charges against contract 50140 IGS.  I talked 
with
Doug Kinney at CES, and he referred me to you.  Should Enron be paying these
charges?  Do you need me to send copies of the invoices to you, or do you have
an accounting contact for me?

   Any help you can give me would be greatly appreciated.

   PS  Credit tells me that the Jan Gulf invoice is outstanding, also.

Attached are the initial drafts of a closing checklist and the related 
closing documents to pay off and unwind Project Alchemy and place the asset 
into the Project Hawaii structure.  This transaction is structured as a trust 
to trust transfer, which is contemplated in the Amended and Restated Hawaii 
125-O Facility Agreement.  The anticipated closing date for this transaction 
is May 31, 2000.  The only significant missing information in the documents 
is the maturity date and the related auction dates.  Please advise as to the 
maturity date and I will calculate the auction dates.

The documents attached are clean versions in Word.  Immediately following 
this e-mail, I will send a follow-up e-mail with clean versions of each 
document in Word Perfect.  Following that, I will send two e-mails attaching 
copies of the documents marked against the Project Blackbird Unwind and 
related Hawaii 125-O Danno A documents, in both Word and Word Perfect.

Please review the attached documents and call me with any comments or 
questions.  My direct line is 214-659-4461 and my direct fax is 
214-659-4784.  Please let me know if any additional people should be a

It was a christmas song.  and I told you that you were missing out because you have ever heard me sing.  it was dumb, but funny at the time."

My secretary contacted SMS. I was surprised that they want to charge

the cost of a conference. The is the first invitation to speak I received, combined with a request to pay for

"On the issue of the contracts, the draft says that the $170m is paid when the

Subject: Re: CRRA LOI  


1.  The pricing that we have given CRRA is specific to FuelCell Energy and 
would not be meaningful without listing the manufacturer (i.e., ONSI would be 
a lot more money).  Hence, I think that we have to reference the manufacturer.

2.  The attachment of the Development Agreement is a Jeff question.  In order 
to mark any 2000 income, we will need to get CRRA to execute the Development 
Agreement in 2000.  In my opinion, we should show CRRA a copy of the LOI with 
the assumption that the Development Agreement is attached.  I would actually 
send them the draft Development Agreement a couple days after the LOI.  Based 
on how CRRA reacts, I would make an ultimate determination if the agreement 
needs to be attached to the LOI.  

3.  I expect at least one EPC contract per project.  We don't want to 
condition the acceptance of one project on the performance of another 
project.  Performance tests will either be performed on a project basis or a 
unit by unit basis in a given project.

Hi Chris,

Please give me a call this afternoon and let me know if you've had a chance 
to look over the deals for october that Mary Ellenberger emailed to you last 
week. I would like to get this matter resolved this week. 

Thanks
Darla

"I've got Mike Swerzbin checking on this deal. He says Holli Krebs actually 
did the deal, so he's trying to get a hold of her right now to verify the 
term. I'll let you know as soon as I find out.

Thanks,
Kate

When I tried to verbally confirm this deal, the counterparty has this deal 
running for three months, December through February.  Could you check with 
the trader and either change it or have him talk to the counterparty about 
it.  Let me know.

Thanks!

"John:
I have reviewed the new draft and just have a few nits which I will send 
you.  My only disagreement is with the LC language.  We feel very strongly 
that we need the LC provisions and the form of lc.  The LC provisions are 
between us and you and have nothing to do with the LC bank who will be 
issuing the LC.  They set forth the mechanics for the rights that each party 
has with respect to any LC that is issued for its benefit.  These mechanics 
need to be agreed to ahead of time.  The form of LC ties into these 
mechanics.  Our credit group will work with you when an LC is issued if for 
some reason the language in the LC does not exactly match.  I look forward to 
hearing from you.

Kay:

We have enclosed drafts of the following documents for review:

 1. $16,100,000 Promissory Note to be executed by the LLC
payable to ENA;
 2. Membership Certificate No. 1 (100% in the name of ENA);
 3. Membership Certificate No. 2 (20% in the name of ENA);
 4. Membership Certificate No. 3 (80% in the name of TEH).

We have not drafted the form of the promissory note to be executed by the
LLC payable to TEH, as we have no information on the proposed terms of that
note.

I understand that the back sides of the membership certificates require a
little extra handiwork to print, but hopefully the substance of the
certificates will come across.  If you would prefer that I fax over the
certificates, please let me know.  Thank you.

We are working on an e-signature ""protocol"" and wondered if ISDA wanted to

		 To: Mark E Haedicke/HOU/ECT@ECT
		 cc: 
		 Subject: E-Signature Protocol

Mark:

Pursuant to our discussion last week, below is a rough draft of a proposal 
for an electronic signature protocol, which could be presented to ISDA for 
further consideration and discussion after we have further discussed:

E-Signature Protocol

Objective: In light of the enactment of the US federal legislation on 
electronic signatures (effective as of 10/1/00), a simple, reliable, and 
enforceable protocol should be established to facilitate the electronic 
execution of Master Agreements (and confirmations where required).  To 
facilitate the wider use of electronic contracts, this protocol could be 
endorsed by ISDA. Hopefully, it would become a standard that others would use 
for all types of contracts. Perhaps, if necessary or helpful, the adoption of 
the protocol could be done electronically by each party unilaterally agreeing 
to abide by it, possibly using the same type of approach ISDA used in 
connection with the introduction of the EMU currency a few years ago.  
Initially, the protocol would be primarily applicable to U.S. counterparties, 
but it could be expanded to non-U.S. counterparties as e-signature laws like 
the new U.S. law are enacted across the globe.

Basic Protocol:  By adopting the protocol, each counterparty would agree that 
the relevant agreement may be electronically signed by complying with the 
following steps:

1) The parties negotiate and agree on a final form the relevant agreement, 
and appoint one of the parties (""First Party"") to prepare the document for 
electronic signature;

2) The First Party prepares the final form in the PDF format (e.g., the body 
of the text could not be modified) with the exception of the blank signature 
blocks for each party to be placed on the last page of the agreement;

3) An authorized signatory of the First Party electronically signs the 
agreement (Note: this electronic signature could be accomplished by 
inscribing an electronic handwritten signature or the signatory typing in 
his/her name and title in the blank signature block);

4) The agreement, as electronically signed by the First Party, is sent via 
electronic means (e.g., by e-mail) by the First Party to the other party 
(""Second Party"");

5) An authorized signatory of the Second Party  electronically signs the 
agreement (Note: this electronic signature could be accomplished by 
impressing an electronic handwritten signature or the signatory typing in 
his/her name and title in the signature block);

6) The agreement, as electronically signed by the Second Party, is sent via 
electronic means (e.g., by e-mail) by the Second Party to the First Party, 
accordingly, creating the fully executed agreement; and

7) Each party would be responsible for maintaining in its own electronic 
archives the agreement as electronically signed by the parties.

Also, the following could be considered: (a) adding to the protocol that each 
party,by adopting the protocol, agrees to be bound by any agreement entered 
into by means of the protocol, and any other appropriate language to enhance 
the enforceability of the ""e-signature"" process and (b) adding to the 
preprinted form of the Master Agreement, a provision whereby each party 
adopts the electronic signature protocol endorsed by ISDA as in effect from 
time to time.

Mark, I would be happy to discuss this draft proposal with you further at 
your convenience.



Regards, Alan

ENA ISDA Master), London e-commerce issues are normally handled ty the London 
lawyer (Conrad Libischer at 44-20-754-52705).  If  NY trader is also 
involved, then DB must decide on one lawyer to handle password application, 
etc.

The ENA ISDA Master must first be approved by Frankfurt.  I don't know how 
long this takes.

You may want to let the DB trader start the EOL process.

"Hi Maureen:

Steve should have received via fax from Scott Govenar a letter to Hertzberg 
and Burton from the Republican leadership in the CA Legislature.  The letter 
1) conveys a strong willingness on the part of the Republicans to work 
together to solve the problem and 2) provides an outline of the key 
components of a comprehensive solution.  Could you please get a copy of the 
letter to Rosalee; and Rosalee could you get a copy of the letter to Ken 
Lay?    Thanks very much for your help.

Best,

Joel,

Mary Lynn Ruffner has been involved, but to my knowledge has not reviewed the 
documents.  Matt Gockerman handles most of the tax stuff for enovate.

As for the structure, the commercial focus is on keeping things as simple as 
possible.  

If Sarah doesn't have a copy of the LLC agreement, I can get you one.

Lou Stoler was involved in the formation of enovate, although I coordinate 
most of their legal issues now.

I've seem a preliminary DASH, but I don't know where it sits now.

Hope this helps.

Kay

i faxed comments on the CA and note to Heather at Bracewell earlier today. 
Would like to see copies of the LLC Agreement and the propsed guaranty. 

Who from tax and accounting is reviewing this deal?

Is there a reason for member guaranties rather than equity funding agreements 
or note purchase agreements or any other structure?


Is a DASH/GASH prepared?

Who in legal handled the formation of the Enovate entity? [just in case I had 
questions about structure, etc.]

"Best of luck.  You've got a tough job.  Guess you'll be working that much 
harder now that John Stevens is on his way to San Francisco.

At last week's meeting, a request was made for peak and off peak prices.  
I've attached prices that we filed yesterday at FERC as part of its on-going 
proceeding of forward contracts.  Few comments:  

We'd appreciate it if you could keep the information confidential, 
particularly since the information is covered by FERC's confidentiality 
provisions.

Since we are not a ""generator,"" we buy and sell in the market, which as you 
know is currently very volatile. Consequently, the quotes that we provide 
customers change daily to reflect changing market prices.  These prices were 
put together and filed yesterday, but you may have heard that prices were 
down today.  So quotes we made today were lower.   And quotes we makes 
tomorrow will reflect tomorrow's market conditions and will likely be 
different from today's.

Because these quotes were assembled yesterday, they are only ""indicative.""  
That is, if someone wanted to buy these products today, we'd have to 
recalculate prices, because the quotes established yesterday are no longer 
valid (for the reasons I mentioned above).

Hope this helps.  If you have any questions, let me know.

Best,
Jeff

"While you guys were all busy worrying over the California energy crisis, I 
slipped down to Mexico to conduct an investigation of how our neighbors even 
further to the south are faring. Do they still have lights? Is the AC shot? 
Can they even make a blended margarita?

Seriously, though, I will be out of the office on Friday, Dec. 22, and again 
from Wednesday, Dec. 27 to Monday, Jan. 2. I realize this is late notice; I 
did let Richter know awhile ago, but I probably should have spread the word a 
little further. I am truly sorry.

At any rate (below the price cap of course), while I am gone I would be so 
appreciative if one of you could run the Dow Jones report in the morning and 
the EOL report in the evening. Dow Jones will only need to be taken care of 
from Wed. through Fri. of next week. I will call on those days, and I can 
easily explain the procedure over the phone to those of you who don't know 
it. If I call and you're ridiculously busy, just hang up on me. I'll call 
back later.

The EOL report we have come to know and love is actually being fixed right 
now. I will talk with Nicolay Kraltchev, the Houston IT guy in charge of 
fixing it, on Friday, Dec. 22. It should be up and running again by Friday 
afternoon. Again, I'll call to check in and make sure this works, or explain 
how to use it.

I'll be in the office on Monday, Dec. 25, just briefly to make sure it hasn't 
exploded in my absence, but then I'll be off to the land where tequila is 
better for you than water. Sounds terrible. Please don't hesitate to call if 
you have any questions, or problems, of the work sort, of course.

We have not received anything yet.  Carol Gravener is my new Duke contact for 
this ISDA and I left a message today with her to see exactly when she sent it 
out.  She is out of her office until Wednesday so, I may not receive a 
response before then.

When I spoke to her on July 28th, she said that they were sending the

Sagging Telecommunications Sector Leads Nasdaq Down 
By Johnathan Burns 
  
04/03/2001 
Dow Jones News Service 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones&Company, Inc.) 
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The telecommunications sector led the Nasdaq Composite 
Index down Tuesday, as investors worrying about the earnings season and a 
slowdown in carrier spending hammered many stocks to new lows. 
The selloff of telecommunications carriers and equipment makers was 
widespread, with all of the big-name companies trading negatively. 
Shares of optical component maker JDS Uniphase Corp. (JDSU) earlier hit a 
52-week low, recently trading down 11% to $14.88. Optical systems market 
leader Nortel Networks Corp. (NT) also hit a 52-week low, recently trading 
down 7% to $13. The day's biggest loser in the equipment space was optical 
systems maker Ciena Corp. (CIEN), which hit a new low and was recently 
trading down 16.5% to $35.50. 
The bloodshed was so widespread that a host of other equipment companies also 
hit new lows: Lucent Technologies Inc. (LU) recently traded down 11% to $7.88 
while Corvis Corp. (CORV) was recently down 14.4% to $5.19. 
A rash of earnings warnings by software companies like Redback Networks Inc. 
(RBAK) and fiber optic equipment maker Harmonic Inc. (HLIT) after the bell 
Monday, coupled with continued funding concerns for start-up phone companies, 
served as a one-two punch for the sector. 
Start-up phone company Winstar Communications Inc. (WCII) recently traded 
down almost 54% to 41 cents, while peers Teligent Inc. (TGNT) dropped 31% to 
28 cents and XO Communications Inc. fell 38% to $3.22. Investors have become 
increasingly nervous that those companies will face bankruptcy, as the 
capital markets have dried up. 
Even well-funded carriers weren't exempt from Tuesday's selling pressure. 
Shares of Qwest Communications International Inc. (Q) barely stayed above its 
52-week low of $32.13, recently dropping 6.2% to $33.50, while shares of AT&T 
Corp. (T) were off 5.1% to $20 and WorldCom Inc. (WCOM) fell 6.4% to $17.50.

talk.

FYI. In bizarre times, help can sometimes come from bizarre places.  Granted, 
we're likely to disagree strongly with Hogan's continued obsession with 
Poolco, but the discussion in his paper regarding market power may be 
helpful---I've read the Joskow paper, but haven't yet had a chance to review 
the Hogan piece.  

Steve and I discussed the need to do a focused assessment of the Joskow/Kahn 
""analysis""  (remember it's Ed Kahn, not Alfred Kahn).  Seems that it would be 
very useful to fold into that analysis any useful stuff on market power 
included in the paper done by Hogan & Co.  If, in the end, there ain't 
nothing useful, so be it.  But seems like there's little downside to 
exploring it.

Jim, my understanding is that Alan is already working with the fundamentals 
folks on the Portland desk to deconstruct the Joskow paper.  Might want to 
include the Hogan paper in those discussions and might also be useful to pull 
Seabron Adamson into the thinking, too.  Ultimately, may be preferable to 
have any assessment of Joskow and/or Hogan to come from economists, rather 
than directly from us. 

Best,
Jeff

Has FERC Gone Far Enough in California?
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission isn't going far enough in its 
attempt to reform the California wholesale electric market, according to a 
paper by three prominent economists done for San Diego Gas and Electric. The 
paper by John D. Chandley, Scott M. Harvey, and William W. Hogan argues that 
FERC should first end the artificial separation that divides the California 
Power Exchange and the California Independent System Operator, rather than 
worrying about the governance of the two institutions.
""The change in governance may help,"" says the paper - ""Electricity Market 
Reform in California"" - ""but it is not likely to be decisive in the near 
term. Explicit guidance from the commission regarding the nature and 
trajectory of reforms will be essential if market reform is to be 
accomplished within an acceptable time frame."" Hogan, of the Kennedy School 
of Government, has been writing since 1995 in opposition to California's 
market separation.
Also, argues the paper, freeing the California utilities to engage in forward 
contracting is no panacea. ""The expectation that merely allowing utilities to 
participate in forward contracting necessarily would be the solution to high 
prices is problematic and not supported by the commission's staff report,"" 
says the analysis, adding that ""putting pressure on buyers to sign contracts 
in the present environment may make things worse."" If the underlying problem 
in California is high cost and low capacity, requiring forward contracting 
could harm not only California but also the entire Western U.S. electric 
system.
FERC's $150 so-called ""soft cap"" is a wild card that has the three economists 
scratching their heads. ""It does not appear in the staff report and there is 
little critical analysis of their implications, other than the discussion of 
Commissioner [Curt] Hebert."" If the intent of the soft cap is to move toward 
cost justification for bids above $150/MWh, then FERC is headed into an 
administrative morass ""that would rival those under wellhead price controls 
in the natural gas industry.""
If, on the other hand, the soft cap is ""truly soft"" and would only require 
some paper work at FERC and the possibility of a refund if the price is 
eventually deemed not just and reasonable, ""there might be little impact on 
consumer prices (particularly if the principal sources of those high prices 
are high costs and regional capacity shortages rather than the exercise of 
market power). Even so, the proposal might serve to deter entry and new 
investments, thus combining the worst of both worlds, high consumer prices 
and little or no new investment.""
FERC's proposed order in California also demonstrates confusion about just 
what constitutes market power. The paper cites the proposed order's lawyerly, 
obfuscatory conclusion that ""while this record does not support findings of 
specific exercises of market power, and while we are not able to reach 
definite conclusions about the actions of individual sellers, there is clear 
evidence that in California market structure and rules provide the 
opportunity for sellers to exercise market power when supply is tight and can 
result in unjust and unreasonable rates under the [Federal Power Act]."" The 
economists note, ""In this regard, the debate is confused because we are 
dancing around the words where the truth may be hard to face.""
In the case of California, say the economists, there is no evidence of market 
power. Even the practice of generators avoiding the day-ahead market in favor 
of the real-time market ""is a response to bad market design and pricing 
incentives (including price caps), but does not demonstrate the exercise of 
market power."" Nor is bidding above marginal cost necessarily an exercise of 
market power, they add. ""The distinction between direct marginal cost and 
opportunity cost is sometimes lost in the discussion. Hence, a competitive 
bidder whose direct cost of generation is $40 but who could sell the same 
energy outside California for $100 should bid no less than $100. This would 
not be an exercise of market power.""

Subject:	Meeting with Edison (John Fielder) re: Getting Edison to Pay Us What We're Owed for the PX Credit

Talked to John Fielder (SVP at the utility) this morning in an attempt to determine if Edison will come around and pay us the PX credit they owe us.

Summary of our offer:
Edison pays us 90% of what they owe us as of 01.17.01.
Payment structure: Edison pays us 10% immediately, with an agreed to (speedy) payment schedule for the remaining 90%.
In return, we drop our complaint against Edison at the PUC.
In return, we agree to a bottoms-up approach retroactive to March 1 to replace the current PX Credit/Residual CTC framework.

Fielder said that he didn't see any show-stoppers in our proposal, but had to check back on his end.  However, there were three additional issues that he wanted to add to any deal:
Some agreement regarding payment of Edison's undercollection (this would cover any of our DA customers who were bundled services customers pre-January 17). We agreed that this would only be an issue to the extent that the Legislature and/or the PUC agreed that Edison should get authority to recoup its undercollection in rates.
Some agreement on DWR stranded costs.  John expressed the view that DWR bought power under the assumption that the customers who've recently gone DA would be there to take the power, and now that they've left, they should contribute in some way to any stranded costs. I told John that this issue is a hornet's nest, that we were better off leaving it out, but we'd consider his proposals.
Some agreement on forebearance.  I told John that if Edison agrees to pay us, it didn't seem that forebearance would be off the table.

We agreed to touch base at the same time Wednesday morning.  The idea is that he'll get back to me with Edison's reaction to our proposal; and we'd get back to him on Edison's proposals.

Might be useful to determine whether we want to continue the discussions.  While John seemed very inclined to work something out, all signals are that the Legislature isn't inclinded to bail Edison out next week.  In which case, Edison could be in bankruptcy in a couple of weeks, which would presumably nullify any agreement we might reach with them. On the other hand, if the Legislature pulls a rabbit out of a hat, an agreement might have real value.

Any comments folks have on 1) Edison's proposals and 2) whether it makes sense to continue discussions on Wednesday are appreciated.  Seems that, at a minimum, if we agree to consider Edison's proposals, then our payment should go from 90 cents to 100 cents on the dollar.

Best,
Jeff"

Jeff;
In response to your questions, I cannot explain why everyone missed this
bill in the past, I have raised it to the attention of my clients twice in
the last two months.  However, now that it is moving they have got the
message.  Williams (Kern River) is going to host a meeting today to create a
coalition to oppose the bill.  Bev Hansen knows where the meeting will take
place.  In addition to Williams, I understand that Questar, WSPA, and other
retail customer groups will join the coalition and oppose the bill.  My
client Wild Goose will also be listed in opposition, but they don't carry
that much clout or name recognition so far.  I am hopeful that other groups
will surface soon.

As for the bill itself, the problem is two fold.  First, the CPUC decides
what infrastructure to build at the request of the utilities.  They take
input from customers, but Loretta is a command and control type all the way,
and she will try to scare away private capital investment by interstate
pipelines by mandating that the utilities build a gold-plated
state-regulated system.  While the bill does not (and cannot legally) bar
interstate pipelines from coming into the state, it has provisions which
will prevent large customers from signing up with the interstates.  The
large customers have to commit to take firm service on a 5 year basis with
exit fees.  If they don't take this, they can only get interruptible service
from the utilities.  Many if not all large customers, especially generators
cannot afford to take partial service from an interstate and have only
interruptible access to the LDC system.  This is the same dilemma that the
RLS tariff caused.  My belief is that the obligation on the part of the
commission to provide the utilities with cost recovery for the new
investments will be used as justification by the utilities for another
attempt to reinstitute the RLS tariff or an onerous peaking rate.  The
Commission will impose a premium price on service to customers who have not
undertaken the firm 5 year commitment and will therefore be unable to
economically take partial requirements service from an interstate.  My view
is based on Sempra's reaction to the current peaking rate proposed decision
and statements by Lynch's office.  This could interfere with Enron gas sales
over the interstates, and would certainly threaten any Transwestern plans
for building across the border into California, although that does not
appear to be a high priority at this time.  This bill will also make it more
costly to develop gas supply arrangments for new power plants which had
hoped to direct connect to interstate pipeline capacity for a portion of
their needs.

Please call if you have further questions.  Mike Day

I've taken a quick look at the bill and have attached for easy viewing.
Few questions.

Mike,
   I understand from our conversation yesterday that your following this on
   behalf of Questar.  Do we know if the other pipelines have been active
   in any discussions on this bill?
   What about the generators?  Have then been involved, since presumably,
   their in need of lots more capacity (and they're referenced in the
   bill)?
   What about large customers?  They been screaming for more
   infrastructure, too, and many have blamed SoCalGas (and the PUC) for not
   delivering it.
   Do we know if pipelines, generators, large customers are supporting or
   opposing the bill?  I'll try to check around, too, in between the
   electric mayhem.
   There doesn't seem to be anything in the bill that prevents the
   interstates from building into the state.
   If that's true, wouldn't the PUC take those projects into account when
   doing its analysis and only require the utility to construct (and
   noncore to take) capacity that isn't already being met by others (i.e.,
   interstates) bringing pipe into the state?

Any info you can provide on these fronts would be very useful.  Don't want
Enron too far out in front of opposition until we find out a bit more
regarding 1) whose fer and agin it and 2) analysis of what the bill
actually does/does not do.

Thanks again for the heads up.

Best,
Jeff

Subject:  AB 23XX   Bad Bill Alert

Is AB 23XX moving with a chance of passage?   I just learned that this
Pescetti bill that was AB 1425 was revived as a 2X bill.  It is very
anti-competitive, and could hurt a number of TW, EES, or ENA gas deals by
binding customers to 100% utility service through the imposition of large
exit fees by the CPUC.  If there is a chance that it moves, we need to
discuss the effect of this bill.  Mike Day

Subject: Updated EOL Customer profiles

Frank:

We have recently rethought our treatment of some of our Western 
counterparties.  Originally, if a Western CP traded power in the West under 
the WSPP Agreement, we permitted the CP to enter into Enron Sales only for 
Eastern power pursuant to the on-line GTCs.  However, we have decided that 
certain of such CPs should not be permitted to trade Eastern power at all.  
Accordingly, please revise the profile for the CPs listed below so that they 
cannot buy or sell Eastern power products via EOL:

Arizona Public Service Company
Avista Corporation - Washington Water Power Division
British Columbia Power Exchange Corporation
California Department of Water Resources
City of Redding
Colorado Springs Utilities
Idaho Power Company
Los Angeles Department of Water & Power
Nevada Power Company
Northern California Power Agency
Pacificorp
Public Service Company of Colorado
Public Service Company of New Mexico
Sacremento Municipal Utility District
Salt River Project Agricultural Improvement and Power District
San Diego Gas & Electric Company
Seattle City Light
Sierra Pacific Power Company
St. Joseph Light & Power Co.
Tucson Electric Power Company

If any of these CPs have previously traded any Eastern power products, please 
let me know at your earliest convenience so that I can address this issue.

Please note that this change should not affect the ability of these CPs to 
trade Western power products.

Thanks:

It will be great if we could have your recruiting people meet with our

Regarding your visit, we'd be glad to cover the coach airfare and
lodging.  How about the first week of October, say on either 10/2 or 10/4,
or the last week of October, say 10/30?  The arrangement would be that you
come in on the evening of a Monday or a Wednesday and give a seminar on a

"I got your voice mail message and I understand your concerns around Todd's 
time.  I think we have it backwards for James to dictate how and when Todd's 
help would be needed.  I think that we can review the ""to do"" list from James 
and get back with him on how much of that we can help with, who would do it, 
what the timing would be, how we might suggest organizing and prioritizing 
the work, etc.  As I said originally, I knew that Todd would not be 
interested (nor available) for a month's worth of work.  Todd's tendency 
(remember this with weather, too) is to think that he has to do all of the 
work himself.  He has had enough experience that his organization, guidance 
and leadership can be very valuable without his doing all of the work 
himself.  If James' list looks long and involved, how could Todd lead these 
efforts, what kind of team might he ask James to provide, what additional 
short-term resources might we be able to tap into in Houston, etc.  We have 
to think a little out of the box to offer a potential solution to James.  If 
you are willing, I would be glad to explore this with Todd and challenge him 
to think about how he could provide leadership to the effort, but not do all 
of the work.  I want him to think like a consultant on these projects, not as 
the contracted hired help!  Let me know what you think.  --Sally

I don't see any huge problems with Todd helping out Continental Power.  He 
needs to spend some time in Oslo anyways reviewing the weather business 
there.  I agree that one month might be unreasonable and would look to Todd 
to determine the proper timeframe.  I will talk to Todd and Mike Jordan 
regarding the best way to proceed with this.

As we said before, I would like to be able to utilize Todd Hall for special 
projects from time to time.  I had mentioned to Mike Jordan that once Todd 
completed his CommodityLogic role that I thought that we could take some of 
his time to follow up on Continental Power issues, which could fit nicely 
with some work he could do on Weather in Europe.  I don't know about the one 
month timeframe.  I would prefer that Todd review the initiatives and 
determine the best way to proceed.  It might mean a couple of weeks over 
there for starters, and then a follow up, shorter trip a few weeks later.  I 
don't think that Todd is keen on any elongated stays in Europe, particularly 
without the family.  Can we still use Todd ?

Sally,

As you are probably aware the Continental Power book split project went well 
but there were a number of areas which were not completed for one reason or 
another but essentially IT did not deliver according to the agreed timetable. 
Todd was instrumental in helping me to drive this forward and was responsible 
for much of what we achieved.

As you may also be aware we had some personnel issues and there have been 
significant changes in the Continental Risk Management team. We have now 
recruited a strong manager in Coralie Evans from CSFB and she starts on the 
29th of August. We have also added Michelle Waldhauser from the Houston Gas 
Risk Management team who arrived on the 7th of August.

There are a number of issues and developments which would greatly benefit 
from having Todd here in London for around a month (I say around a month as I 
am guessing within this period he would want to spend some time in Oslo 
pushing the weather Risk Management area forward). Attached is a page I put 
together that cover our immediate needs and why Todd is ideally placed to 
potentially add an enormous amount of value to the Continental Power business.

Could we please get together with Brent Price and Mike Jordan and discuss 
whether Todd would be available come over.

Thanks and regards James

		 Subject: Help in Michigan

Once again, I come to you for help.  We were awarded a biosolids dewatering 
contract in Grand Rapids, Michigan about a month ago.  We had bid against the 
incumbent, a company called Synagro.  You may recall that Azurix is in 
litigation with Syangro over a busted acquisition, but the two events are not 
related.  In any case, we were low bidder, and the recommendation was made to 
award the contract to us.  Synagro has been working to get the award 
overturned, and appears to have been successful.  It is not yet clear whether 
they are going to award the deal to Synagro, or re-bid.  It is not even clear 
what the grounds are for overturning the award, which indicates that it may 
be pure politics.  

Do we have any good political consultants that could help us in Grand 
Rapids?  We do not have much of a presence in that area, and were responding 
to a publicly advertised bid.  Price and technical qualifications were the 
only issues.  Politics did not enter into it until now, so we were caught a 
little flat-footed.   

Any suggestions?

with a counterparty when we do not have a master in place.  Any non-master
